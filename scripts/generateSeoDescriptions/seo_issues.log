./rules/do-you-manage-up/rule.md:
Do you manage up? Give a recommendation. Managing up is providing your manager with an active request or an option to approve, rather than asking a general question. When managing up, it's essential to provide recommendations and options for approval, ensuring that the decision-making process is streamlined and effective. Here are some best practices when giving someone multiple options: 1. Limit the number of options to 3 to avoid "option overload". 2. Recommend one option and state why. 3. Enumerate the options (e.g., Option A or Option 1). By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage up and provide your manager with a clear direction for decision-making. --- Recommendation: Customize a ready-made solution (Option A) - It is cheaper than building a new solution from scratch and we are able to get rid of redundant features and change it to meet our requirements.

./rules/generate-ui-mockups-with-ai/rule.md:
**Do You Generate UI Mockups with AI?** Traditionally, creating UI wireframes and mockups has been a manual process using tools like Figma, Excalidraw, Balsamiq, or pen and paper. However, generative AI tools have streamlined this process, allowing for the creation of proof of concepts or translating designs to code with just a few clicks. In this article, we'll explore how AI-assisted design tools can help with generating UI components from text and images. We'll also examine the benefits of using these tools in your workflow, including faster development times and collaboration with stakeholders in real-time. **Boilerplate** When developers are handed design images, it can be a time-consuming process to build the baseline components, HTML, and CSS before getting started on the actual project. AI- assisted tools like v0.dev can help with this process by producing React components that you can drop into your project, giving you a head start on the work. **Proof of Concepts** Generative UI tools can be used to collaborate with stakeholders in real-time, allowing for the generation of ideas and iteration over them using natural language prompts. This can give developers or designers a useful starting point and frame of reference to build a highly polished design. If you're a developer who likes to moonlight as a designer, these tools can be a great timesaver in creating professional-looking web components in a short amount of time. **Example** Using v0.dev and a few prompts, you can achieve the following: A cool user form with material style component, primary color red, and icons next to labels. **Tools** LICENSE README.md _docs assets categories do-you-know-how-to-keep-track-of-your-ppc-campaign-spend history.json rules scripts template v0.dev LICENSE README.md _docs assets categories do-you-know-how-to-keep-track-of-your-ppc-campaign-spend history.json rules scripts template builder.io (Generate Figma Designs with AI) LICENSE README.md _docs assets categories do-you-know-how-to-keep-track-of-your-ppc-campaign-spend history.json rules scripts template UIMagic (waitlist) LICENSE README.md _docs assets categories do-you-know-how-to-keep-track-of-your-ppc-campaign-spend history.json rules scripts template Pineapple Builder I hope this helps!

Issues found in SEO description for ./rules/gpt-tokens/rule.md:
Understanding how ChatGPT tokens work is crucial to maximizing its performance and efficiency. In this guide, we'll explore how GPT models utilize tokens, their influence on ChatGPT's performance, and tips for managing tokens. ChatGPT models break down text data into tokens, which can be as small as a single character or as large as a word. This flexible understanding of tokens enables the model to efficiently analyze and generate new text. For instance, the word "unhappiness" could be tokenized into three parts: "un," "happi," and "ness." Each part is considered a separate token. ### How GPT Models Utilize Tokens GPT models are trained on vast amounts of text data, where data is divided into tokens. Through this process, the model comprehends statistical relationships between tokens, enabling it to generate new text that mirrors the style and content it was trained on. ### The Influence of Tokens on ChatGPT's Performance ChatGPT breaks down an input message into tokens and uses these to generate a sequence of output tokens. This reflects what it has learned during training. The model can process only a specific number of tokens in a single instance, counted as the token limit. This limit is around 4000 for GPT-3.5 and about 8000 for GPT-4. For example, if you send a message of 10 tokens to ChatGPT and it responds with a message of 20 tokens, that would count as 30 tokens used. The count includes both input and output tokens. ### Tips for Managing Tokens 1. Limit prompt length: Since the number of input tokens affects the total token count, keep your prompts concise, especially if you expect a long answer. 2. Control the length of responses: If you are planning on having a longer conversation with ChatGPT, you can specify a length limit to prevent it from generating overly long responses that consume too many tokens. 3. Use clear prompting: Direct prompts can lead to more efficient token usage. Try to be specific and clear in your prompts to get a better response that uses fewer tokens and doesn't give you background info you're not interested in. 4. Balance complex queries: There are scenarios where complex queries or long explanations may require a large number of tokens (e.g., you are inputting a multi-page document for ChatGPT to summarize). In such cases, it's essential to be mindful of the token count and use techniques like summarization or abstraction to reduce the token count while keeping the important information.

Issues found in SEO description for ./rules/create-friendly-short-urls/rule.md:
Friendly URLs make a huge difference in making your links more readable and understandable. Here's an example of how to create friendly and short URLs: **Shorten Unfriendly URLs** Link: northwind.com/blog/visual-studio-2022-sample-data Bad example - The long URL makes it hard to clearly see what it will take you. **Create Friendly URLs** Link: northwind.com/find-word-document-version Good example - The filler words removed and only 'juicy' words remain. If you're not in control of the link, use Bitly (https://bitly.com/) to transform any long URL into a shorter, more readable link. Auto-generated shorten URL: bit.ly/3zTHz8b OK example - Auto-generated shorten URL - It's short but hard to remember. When you have a Bitly account, you can customize links to a more readable option. Custom shorten link: bit.ly/VS-2022-Sample Good example - Short URL, and easier to remember.

Issues found in SEO description for ./rules/generate-ui-mockups-with-ai/rule.md:
Do you generate UI mockups with AI? Yes, generative AI tools can help streamline the process of creating UI wireframes. Traditionally, designers and developers would use tools like Figma, Excalidraw, Balsamiq, or pen and paper to create wireframes. However, with the rise of Prompt Engineering, it's now possible to generate proof-of-concept designs or translate designs to code with just a few clicks! These AI-assisted tools can help with the more mundane aspects of UI design, such as creating baseline components, HTML, and CSS. For instance, sites like v0.dev can produce React components (with code) that you can drop into your project, giving you a huge head start on the work. Additionally, generative UI tools can be a great way to collaborate with stakeholders in real-time, allowing you to generate ideas and iterate over them using natural language prompts. This can give developers or designers a useful starting point and frame of reference to build a highly polished design. Overall, AI-generated UI mockups can save time, reduce manual labor, and provide a solid foundation for further design development.

Issues found in SEO description for ./rules/re-purpose-your-pillar-content-for-social-media/rule.md:
**Do you re-purpose your pillar content for social media?** Yes, it's essential to repurpose your pillar content for social media. This approach is known as the "reverse pyramid" model, popularized by Gary Vaynerchuk. By starting with a single piece of pillar content, such as a video or podcast, you can create dozens of smaller pieces of content that are contextual to various platforms. Here's an example of how to do it: 1. **Create pillar content**: Start with a high-quality video or audio clip that will serve as the foundation for all other types of content. 2. **Repurpose content**: Use tools like Giphy and Rev (or Descript) to create quotable images, GIFs, blog posts, and more from your pillar content. 3. **Distribute content**: Post your pillar content on all platforms at 12 pm, followed by posting micro-content that promotes the pillar content at 12:01 pm. 4. **Monitor comments and reply**: Engage with your audience by responding to comments and using them to inform future content creation. 5. **Email the best video to your list**: Share the best-performing video from the week with your email list, along with a recap of other videos. 6. **Republish blog posts**: Wait two weeks before republishing your blog post on other platforms like Medium, LinkedIn Articles, Substack, and Quora. By following these steps, you can maximize the ROI on your content creation efforts and drive more traffic to your YouTube channel, social media profiles, and website.

A Twitter tutorial! In a nutshell: **#Hashtags** are used to categorize your tweet and make it discoverable by others interested in that topic.

This is where ChatGPT comes in - a powerful tool that can help you draft entire emails or parts of them. **Drafting Emails** ChatGPT can help you craft an email that clearly communicates the details and minimizes any inconvenience. For example, if you're unsure how to begin an email to a potential employer, you can ask ChatGPT for suggestions. **Adjust Tone and Length** You can ask for multiple options, from which you can choose the best one. ChatGPT can also adjust the length of an email response according to your requirements, whether you want it shortened or expanded. **Summarize Long Emails** Sometimes important points are buried inside walls of text. You can ask ChatGPT to summarize long emails and give you the gist of it. **Polishing Your Writing** If you've written an email but aren't satisfied with the wording, you can ask ChatGPT to help improve it. It can make your language more professional, courteous, concise, or whatever else you need. **Tone Analysis** You can use ChatGPT to analyze the tone of the emails you receive or send. For example, you can ask it to identify if an email sounds angry, respectful, sarcastic, etc. This can help you craft appropriate responses. **Customizing for Context** ChatGPT can adjust the content and tone of the generated email response based on your needs. You can instruct it to write a polite declination or make an announcement more engaging for your employees. **Replying to a Thread** Sometimes you don't know where to start when replying to a thread of messages. ChatGPT can give you a quick start by drafting a reply to the email thread below. **Personal Email Template** When using ChatGPT to draft emails, it's useful to have your own repeatable prompt or template to use each time.

Issues found in SEO description for ./rules/using-digital-asset-manager/rule.md:
Managing a large library of digital files can be a daunting task using just Windows File Explorer or Mac's Finder. The limitations on folder structure and file names can lead to lost and abandoned assets due to rigid search functionality. A Digital Asset Manager (DAM) like Adobe Bridge solves this problem, providing a more comprehensive solution for organizing, editing, and publishing creative assets. For small teams, independent creatives, and budget-conscious individuals, Adobe Bridge is an ideal choice. It allows users to preview, organize, edit, and publish multiple creative assets with thumbnails and rich previews. Additionally, it enables the addition of metadata, including keywords, labels, and ratings, making it easier to find specific assets. Organizing media files using a well-structured folder hierarchy and standard naming convention is crucial for maintaining control over digital assets. Adobe Bridge also offers powerful filters and advanced metadata search features to streamline the process. By leveraging the power of metadata, users can add relevant details such as project name, shoot location, keywords, and descriptions to their files, making it easier to search for specific videos and enhance collaboration within a team. In conclusion, using a Digital Asset Manager like Adobe Bridge is essential for managing a large library of digital files. It provides an organized platform for organizing, editing, and publishing creative assets while also enabling the addition of metadata for enhanced searchability.

Issues found in SEO description for ./rules/add-quality-control-to-dones/rule.md:
The practice of adding quality control measures when sending a "Done" email by including "Checked by XXX" is a good habit to get into. This shows that you have taken the time to double-check your work and ensures that the task is complete and accurate. In this context, it's helpful to CC the person who checked the email with you in the reply, as this provides transparency and accountability for both parties involved. Additionally, the practice of checking grammar and spelling errors before adding web content is also a good habit. This helps to ensure that any written content meets high standards of quality and accuracy. The same applies when running LinkAuditor to detect and correct any bad links on a webpage. This helps to maintain the integrity and credibility of your website by preventing broken or unreliable links from being displayed. Overall, these practices demonstrate a commitment to quality control and attention to detail, which are valuable skills in any profession.

Issues found in SEO description for ./rules/next-dynamic-routes/rule.md:
Do you use dynamic routing in Next.js? Yes, Next.js supports dynamic routes out of the box, allowing you to create routes from dynamic data at request or build time. This feature is especially useful for sites with large amounts of content, such as blogs. Dynamic routes enable developers to accommodate unpredictable URLs by defining segments of the path that can be dynamic. This flexibility allows you to efficiently serve content based on real-time data or user-specific requirements. To use dynamic routes in Next.js, wrap your folder's name in square brackets, such as `[slug].tsx` or `[id].tsx`. The directory structure should mirror the dynamic nature of the routes. For scenarios where routes need to capture multiple path variations, Next.js introduces the "catch-all" feature. This can be employed by prefixing an ellipsis `...` to the dynamic segments. When you export `getStaticProps`, your page will be pre-rendered at build time. You can use `getStaticProps` to retrieve data that will be used to render the page. For example, you might receive a file name from the requested URL, which you can then use in an API call to get the props for that page. You must also use `getStaticPaths` alongside `getStaticProps` for dynamic routing to work. The `getStaticPaths` function returns a list of paths, which NextJS will use to generate the dynamic pages. In summary, using dynamic routing in Next.js provides flexibility and optimization by allowing you to accommodate unpredictable URLs, efficiently serve content, and pre-render pages at build time.

Issues found in SEO description for ./rules/the-difference-between-canvas-apps-and-model-driven-apps/rule.md:
Power Apps provide a low-code environment, but it's crucial to know the difference between Canvas and Model-Driven Apps before building your first app. A Canvas App is a blank canvas where controls can be placed in any order, style, and format required. It supports over 300 data sources and has a low barrier to entry for programming knowledge. Model-Driven Apps are data-first, with a schema-based approach that stores data in the Dataverse. They have a higher entry-level requirement for Data Modelling, JavaScript, or C# knowledge. For task-based apps like logging support tickets, a Canvas App is ideal. For larger solutions that require end-to-end logic, a Model-Driven App is more suitable.

Consistently using a specific character or syntax to identify replaceable text makes it clear what needs to be substituted. **Consistency is key!** Everyone has their own preferences when it comes to placeholder characters. For example: LICENSE README.md _docs assets categories do-you-know-how-to-keep-track-of-your-ppc-campaign-spend history.json rules scripts template SSW Rules historically used `xxx` LICENSE README.md _docs assets categories do-you-know-how-to-keep-track-of-your-ppc-campaign-spend history.json rules scripts template SSW Intranet | Sales templates use ❌❌❌ LICENSE README.md _docs assets categories do-you-know-how-to-keep-track-of-your-ppc-campaign-spend history.json rules scripts template SSW GitHub Sprint Templates use ✏️xxx LICENSE README.md _docs assets categories do-you-know-how-to-keep-track-of-your-ppc-campaign-spend history.json rules scripts template SQL developers are used to `[ ]` LICENSE README.md _docs assets categories do-you-know-how-to-keep-track-of-your-ppc-campaign-spend history.json rules scripts template Word Mail Merge users are used to « »` LICENSE README.md _docs assets categories do-you-know-how-to-keep-track-of-your-ppc-campaign-spend history.json rules scripts template API and React developers are used to `{ }` LICENSE README.md _docs assets categories do-you-know-how-to-keep-track-of-your-ppc-campaign-spend history.json rules scripts template Angular developers are used to `{{ }}` LICENSE README.md _docs assets categories do-you-know-how-to-keep-track-of-your-ppc-campaign-spend history.json rules scripts template Visual Studio code reviewers are used to `TODO:` **Double curly brackets recommended!** Using double curly brackets (`{{ }}`) is a clear and concise way to indicate replaceable text. This syntax is commonly used in popular APIs, frameworks, and tools like Microsoft Graph, PowerPlatform, Facebook, Riot, Amazon, and React. **In certain places, you can't afford to miss a single placeholder!** When working with Sales templates or other critical environments where missing placeholders could have significant consequences, using a clear and consistent syntax is crucial. You can also highlight the text in yellow, use an emoji like ✏️, or make the placeholder all caps to draw attention to it. **Example: Good vs. Bad** Here are two email template examples: **Bad**: Using square brackets (`[]`) for replaceable text ```email-template | | | | -------- | --- | | To: | [Client email] | | Subject: | [Project name] - Test please | ::: email-content ``` **Good**: Using double curly brackets (`{{ }}`) for replaceable text ```email-template | | | | -------- | --- | | To: | {{ CLIENT EMAIL }} | | Subject: | {{ PROJECT NAME }} - Test please | ::: email-content ``` By consistently using double curly brackets (`{{ }}`) for replaceable text, you'll make it clear which parts of the template should be replaced with custom content. This will save time and reduce errors in the long run!

To prevent unapproved spending, establish an approval process for developers requesting new resources. This ensures that only approved services are added, reducing the risk of overspending. **Generate Your Azure Budgets** 1. Use the Azure calculator to determine monthly resource prices. 2. Email the Spend Master with a request to create resources in Azure, including the product/service name, business reasons for the resource, and a link to the Azure calculator. 3.

Issues found in SEO description for ./rules/is-your-first-aim-to-customize-a-sharepoint-webpart/rule.md:
A rule for customizing a SharePoint web part! **Rule:** Before you roll your own custom web part, try to configure existing out-of-the-box SharePoint web parts, such as the Content Query web part (CQWP). **Fields to Configure:** 1. **MainXslLink** and **ItemXslLink**: Set these to control the main and item XSL file paths. 2. **ItemLimit**: Adjust the default number of items displayed on a CQWP from 15 to a higher or unlimited value (e.g., -1). 3. **CommonViewFields**: Add custom fields to the query by specifying field names and types (e.g., "fieldname,fieldtype;"). 4. **Query** and **QueryOverride**: Use the QueryOverride to skip defining the query and use your supplied CAML directly. **Bad Example:** LICENSE README.md _docs assets categories do-you-know-how-to-keep-track-of-your-ppc-campaign-spend history.json rules scripts template Inherit from `System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart` instead of a more specific custom web part class.

Issues found in SEO description for ./rules/do-you-provide-the-reason-behind-the-rules-rather-than-just-enforce-them/rule.md:
Do you provide the reason behind the rules rather than just enforce them? As a standards watchdog, providing the reasoning behind the rules is crucial for effective team collaboration and knowledge sharing. When new or old team members miss a standard, it's essential to explain the "why" behind the rule, rather than simply enforcing compliance. By doing so, you help others understand the importance of the standard, reduce resentment, and encourage a culture of continuous improvement. A good example is providing a link to your standard and explaining the main reason(s) why this standard is important, as seen in the email template below: ``` ### Hi Mark, Regarding that PBI you worked on yesterday. We have a standard about sending Test Please emails to the client (check out [this rule](/request-a-test-please)). This saves time by getting early feedback, allowing bugs to be fixed while it's still fresh in the developer's mind. The longer the feedback loop takes, the more expensive a PBI becomes to the client :( ```

**Do you upsell your products or services?** As a software developer, it's crucial to recognize opportunities for upselling and capitalize on them. When you're already working with a client, you've built trust, and they're more likely to consider additional services or solutions. There are two key scenarios: 1. **When selling a product, upsell your most valuable service**: By offering relevant suggestions beyond the initial solution, you demonstrate expertise and show that you're invested in the customer's success. This can lead to new consulting opportunities. 2. **Consultants should always be visible when they spot an upsell/cross-sell opportunity**: As trusted advisors, developers have a unique advantage in upselling or cross-selling compared to salespeople. Be proactive in identifying opportunities and presenting relevant solutions to clients. Remember, upselling is about providing value and addressing customers' needs. By doing so, you can increase revenue and strengthen your relationships with clients.

Issues found in SEO description for ./rules/use-ai-to-generate-spec-reviews/rule.md:
Use AI to generate Specification Reviews and augment your capabilities as a seasoned analyst. AI can greatly aid in generating Specification Reviews by providing a foundational understanding. However, the expertise and discernment of a human are irreplaceable. AI can ask progressive questions to capture the intricacies of the project scope. For example, an AI can engage with you step-by-step to gather essential requirements and provide comprehensive paragraphs detailing the rationale behind the given information. Templates can be limiting and may not cater to project-specific nuances. Every project is unique, and relying solely on templates can lead to gaps in the specification. AI can generate Product Backlog Items (PBIs) with speed and consistency, and create architecture visualization diagrams using tools like Mermaid. AI can draft an initial Specification Review based on an architecture blueprint, ready for human refinement. Here is an example of how AI can be used: "Engage with me step-by-step to collect essential requirements. For each section, provide comprehensive paragraphs detailing the rationale behind the given information. Ask me one question at a time, and then only ask the next after I have answered the last one. At the end, give me the opportunity to give you more information if needed. Upon completion, gather the information based on my answers and then: 1. Provide me the Specification Review. Also include the current state of the solution. Be sure to include detailed explanations of each section, adding why we recommend the approach and what the benefits are. 2. Develop Product Backlog Items (PBIs) corresponding to the tasks required to fulfill the specifications. 3. Provide the Mermaid syntax to draft both the present and projected architectural flow diagrams."

**Do you know when and how to send a v2 of an email?** Sometimes you'll need to send a new version (v2) of an email. This often occurs due to two main reasons: substantial feedback or realizing you've made a mistake. Having an entire new version of an email ensures that you understood feedback and incorporated it immediately, cleaning up the email thread history to only have relevant content. **How to send a v2 (Outlook)** 1. Open your v1 email in Sent Items 2. Click Actions | Resend this message 3. Include (v2 - {{ REASON }}) on the first line of the email body 4. The reason should include a summary of what was changed 5. If the email is a reply, keep the email history leading up to your original email 6. Replace your v1 with your v2 email, as if the v1 never happened (same for v3, v4, etc) **Note:** For v3 emails, replace (v2 - {{ REASON }}) on the first line of the email body with (v3 - {{ REASON }}). Repeat this for v4, v5, etc. For appointments, the procedure is different; see [do you explain why you've updated or deleted an appointment?](/explain-deleted-or-modified-appointments). **Tip:** If you're doing a lot of these, you can add the 'Resend This Message' button to 'Quick Access' toolbar in Outlook.

Then, navigate into the directory and run `npm install` followed by `npm run dev`. Alternatively, you can start a new React project with NextJS, which is recommended by the official React documentation. Run `npx create-next-app@latest` to get started. If you prefer Gatsby, you can use the `npm init gatsby` command to set up your site. This will guide you through prompts for language, CMS, and styling system. Regardless of the tool you choose, starting a new React project is easier than ever with these options.

A rule about Prompt Engineering! 🚀 **Do you know the fundamentals of Prompt Engineering?** Yes, I do! In ChatGPT prompt engineering, various elements play a critical role in shaping the user's prompt and obtaining the desired output. These elements are: 1. **Role**: The role defines the specific function or identity that the ChatGPT model is expected to assume during the conversation. 2. **Result**: The result refers to the desired outcome or specific information the user seeks to obtain from the interaction with ChatGPT. 3. **Intent**: Intent represents the user's goal or the purpose behind the interaction with the ChatGPT model. 4. **Context**: Context refers to any background information or situational details that are relevant to the conversation. 5. **Constraint**: A constraint is a condition or limitation placed on the model's response. By specifying these elements in the prompt, you can guide ChatGPT to deliver a more relevant and targeted response, addressing your specific needs and expectations. **Example:** Suppose you're seeking advice on improving coding practices, specifically focusing on C#. Here's how each part can be framed: "Give me some C# coding tips" vs. "As a senior software engineer, I need your guidance to improve my C# coding practices. I am working on a large-scale data processing project where readability and efficiency are critical. Can you provide me with some specific, actionable tips to enhance my code's performance while ensuring it remains clean and easy for others to understand?"

Issues found in SEO description for ./rules/architecture-diagram/rule.md:
Do you have an Architecture Diagram? Yes, I do! In fact, I highly recommend using diagrams.net for creating and maintaining your architecture diagrams. With its user-friendly interface and ability to integrate directly into VS Code, it's easy to create professional-looking diagrams quickly and easily. Here are some great examples of architecture diagrams created with diagrams.net: Good example - TimePro (an Angular + .NET project with Hangfire) - you can create diagrams quickly and easily with diagrams.net that still look very professional.

Standardizing where your organisation stores architecture diagrams ensures a consistent experience among developers. Therefore store your architecture diagrams in the repo _docs/ folder. Additionally, the README.md (in the root) should have a link and an embedded image of the high-level architecture diagram (from the _docs/images folder). Tip #10: Use Azure Architecture Center [Azure Architecture Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/) is the best tool to help you figure out the pieces you need for an architecture diagram - see [SSW.Rules | Do you use Azure Architecture Center](/azure-architecture-center) Alternatives to Diagrams.net Miro (by Adobe) [Miro](https://miro.com/) is an online tool designed primarily for whiteboard-style collaboration. It is very easy to use and optimised for this purpose. As a diagramming tool, it is lacking in features compared to Diagrams.net, but it can be used to create simple diagrams.

Issues found in SEO description for ./rules/add-a-bot-signature-on-automated-emails/rule.md:
Adding a bot signature to automated emails can indeed provide transparency and help users distinguish between human-written and machine-generated messages. The example you provided illustrates this well, with the "**--Powered by SSW. Shorts**" disclaimer clearly indicating that the email was sent by a bot. By including such a signature, you're not only being transparent about the automation process but also potentially encouraging users to explore automation options for their own workflows. This can lead to increased efficiency and productivity, as well as improved communication and collaboration within teams or organizations. In your case, the "**--Powered by SSW. Shorts**" signature serves as a clear indication that the email was generated using Microsoft Flow or Logic Apps. This not only adds transparency but also helps users understand that they're interacting with automated systems rather than human senders.

Issues found in SEO description for ./rules/using-markdown-to-store-your-content/rule.md:
A rule! **Title:** Do you use Markdown to store Kendo Editor, TinyMCE, or CKEditor content? **Note:** None of these are recommended because of the HTML that is generated. **Bad example:** ![Figure: Bad example - HTML generated by a rich editor gets harder to maintain over time](HTML-bad.jpg) **Store content in Markdown** Content is typically either stored in files (e.g., git) or a database. When stored in files, it is common to use a static site generator with a JAMStack approach (e.g., Gatsby, Vuepress, Hexo, etc). That is, you commit content into git and a CI/CD pipeline is executed. The resulting files (HTML and CSS) are then served from storage which is cheaper and typically more scalable than compute resources in the cloud. In this case, the workflow will be a development style workflow (commit to git, push, etc) and the editor will be the one you choose (e.g., GitHub editor or VS Code). These editors are not likely to produce a rich editing experience, nor do they need to. **For a non-technical audience** It helps to store your content as Markdown in a database and convert to HTML on the fly. This removes the code repository/CI/CD pipelines and can feel more natural for a non-developer audience. In this case, you will provide an editor, and it is recommended that this be a rich editor. **Markdown rich editors** The Markdown rich editors are not as good as the HTML ones, but at least the content they produce is maintainable over time. Some examples of rich Markdown editors are: LICENSE README.md _docs assets categories do-you-know-how-to-keep-track-of-your-ppc-campaign-spend history.json rules scripts template ProseMirror (http://prosemirror.net/) LICENSE README.md _docs assets categories do-you-know-how-to-keep-track-of-your-ppc-campaign-spend history.json rules scripts template Editor.Md (https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/) (recommended) + Note: It is the #1 editor on [Top 7: Best Markdown editors, Javascript and jQuery plugins](https://ourcodeworld.com/articles/read/359/top-7-best-markdown-editors-javascript-and-jquery-plugins) LICENSE README.md _docs assets categories do-you-know-how-to-keep-track-of-your-ppc-campaign-spend history.json rules scripts template ToastUI Editor (https://ui.toast.com/tui-editor/) (recommended) **Markdown can have rich content too** Markdown is simple and limited, but you can make it richer.

Issues found in SEO description for ./rules/add-useful-and-concise-figure-captions/rule.md:
When adding images and videos to websites or applications, it's helpful to include a caption underneath them, providing extra information for users. This approach helps capture readers' attention, making it easier for them to find relevant content. **Figure: Good example - Some nice useful and concise text describing the image** By prefixing captions with "Figure:", "Video:", or "Code:", you can create a clear distinction between different types of media. Additionally, use prefixes like "Good/OK/Bad example" to provide context and highlight best practices. **Figure: Add useful and concise figure text (a.k.a. caption) to avoid a lot of text over images** To make captions more effective, use bold text to draw attention to them. This helps users quickly identify the purpose of each image or video. **Figure: Bold your captions** When describing actions in screenshots, be specific about what users can do on the screen. This helps users understand how to interact with the content. **Figure: Describe the actions in your captions** For videos, include a caption with the title and length (in brackets). Use "Video:" instead of "Figure:" as a prefix. This provides context, helps with SEO, and informs viewers about what to expect. **Figure: Add titles + length on video captions** Remember to link people's names in your captions to their profiles (e.g., [SSW People](https://ssw.com.au/people)). This adds credibility and makes it easier for users to find more information.

Do you know how to conduct an interview? Conducting an interview requires some basic rules and guidelines. Here are some tips on how to conduct a successful interview: Introduce yourself, the interviewee, and the topic of the interview in a clear and concise manner. Tell the interviewee not to speak until they are introduced, and remain quiet while they are speaking. When the interviewee finishes speaking, move straight to the next question without commenting or reacting to what they said. Choose an unusual statement at the beginning that conveys good communication and honesty with both the audience and the interviewee. During a webcam interview, look directly at the camera as much as possible and keep your notes close by. Overprepare for the interview by having a set of questions ready beforehand. Use screencap cutaways wisely and have them ready to go before the interview starts.
