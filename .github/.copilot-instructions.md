# SSW Rules Content - Copilot Instructions

This repository contains SSW's technical rules and best practices. When working with markdown files in this repository, you have access to several custom markdown extensions and features beyond standard markdown.

## Custom Markdown Extensions

### Custom Containers

The SSW Rules platform supports custom container syntax using triple colons (:::). These create styled boxes for different types of content:

#### Good/Bad Examples

```markdown
::: bad
Figure: Bad example - This shows what not to do - it adds a cross at the start of the line
:::

::: good
Figure: Good example - This shows the recommended approach - it adds a tick at the start of the line
:::

::: ok
Figure: OK example - This is acceptable but not ideal - it adds a 😐 at the start of the line
:::
```

#### Information Boxes

```markdown
::: greybox
This is a box using the class "greybox" - typically used for code examples or quotes.
:::

::: info
This is an information box using the class "info". Use for additional context or tips.
:::

::: highlight
This is a box using the class "highlight" - use to draw attention to important content.
:::
```

#### Special Purpose Boxes

```markdown
::: china
This is a box using the class "china" - used for China-specific content or variations.
:::

::: codeauditor
This is a box using the class "codeauditor" - used for SSW Code Auditor related content.
:::

::: todo
This is a box using the class "todo" - used for content that needs to be completed or updated.
:::
```

### Figure Captions

When using images or code examples, always include descriptive figure captions:

```markdown
![Figure: Description of what the image shows](image-filename.jpg)

::: good
Figure: Good example - Clear description of why this is the recommended approach
:::
```

### Code Blocks

Use language-specific syntax highlighting:

```csharp
// C# code example
public class Example
{
    public void Method() { }
}
```

```powershell
# PowerShell example
Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.Name -eq "chrome" }
```

### Video Embeds

For YouTube videos, use the custom syntax:

```markdown
`youtube: https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID`
```

## Rule Structure

Every rule contain frontmatter at the top.
Then after the intro there should be a `<!--endintro-->` to signal the end of the introduction section.

### Frontmatter format

```yaml
---
type: rule
archivedreason: #empty if not archived
title:  # e.g. "Do you ....?"
seoDescription:  # A brief description of the rule
guid:  # Unique identifier for the rule
uri:  # e.g. "cocona-for-command-line-tools"
created:  # e.g. 2025-01-03T00:00:00.000Z
authors: 
  - title:  # e.g. "Brady Stroud"
    url:  # e.g. "https://www.ssw.com.au/people/brady-stroud"
related: 
  -  # e.g. "provide-list-of-arguments"
  -  # e.g. "dependency-injection"

## Best Practices for SSW Rules

1. **Use good/bad examples** - Always show what not to do vs. what to do
2. **Include figure captions** - Every image and code block should have a descriptive caption
3. **Be specific** - Use concrete examples rather than abstract concepts
4. **Reference other rules** - Link to related rules to create a knowledge web
5. **Keep it practical** - Focus on actionable advice developers can implement

### Links and References

* Internal rule links: `[Rule title](/rule-uri)` (always use relative links for other rules)
* External links: `[Link text](https://example.com)`
* Always use descriptive link text, never "click here" or "read more"

## Content Guidelines

* Write in present tense
* Use active voice
* Neutral, impersonal (third-person) style (company-agnostic/objective)
* Be concise but comprehensive
* Include practical examples
* Use consistent terminology across rules
* Follow the SSW tone of voice (professional but approachable)
* Rule titles are always questions e.g. "Do you use Cocona for building great command line tools in .NET?"

## File Organization

* Rules go in `/rules/rule-name/rule.md`
* Categories go in `/categories/category-name.md`
* Images go next to the rule markdown file
* Use kebab-case for file and folder names

## Adding Rules to Categories

Every rule should belong to at least one category to help users discover related content. Categories are organized in the `/categories` folder and structured by topic.

### Category Structure

Category files are markdown files with a `type: category` frontmatter. They contain an `index` array that lists the URIs of all rules in that category:

```yaml
---
type: category
title: Rules to Better Technical Documentation
guid: 961f2035-1540-4425-9b29-0d6273ac0726
uri: rules-to-better-technical-documentation
index:
  - rule-uri-1
  - rule-uri-2
  - making-last-edited-clear
---
```

### How to Add a Rule to a Category

1. **Find the right category folder**: Categories are organized in folders like:
   * `/categories/communication/` - Communication, documentation, presentations
   * `/categories/software-engineering/` - Software development practices
   * `/categories/project-delivery/` - Project management, delivery processes
   * `/categories/design/` - Design and UX guidelines
   * `/categories/marketing-and-video/` - Marketing and video content
   * `/categories/artificial-intelligence/` - AI and machine learning
   * `/categories/infrastructure-and-networking/` - Infrastructure and networking
   * `/categories/client-engagement/` - Client relationships and sales
   * `/categories/company-operations/` - Internal operations
   * `/categories/others/` - Miscellaneous rules

2. **Choose the most relevant category file**: Browse the category files in the appropriate folder. For example:
   * Documentation rules → `/categories/communication/rules-to-better-technical-documentation.md`
   * Testing rules → `/categories/software-engineering/rules-to-better-unit-tests.md`
   * Meeting rules → `/categories/communication/rules-to-better-meetings.md`

3. **Add the rule URI to the index**: Open the category file and add the rule's URI (from the rule's frontmatter) to the `index` array. Typically add it at the end of the list.

4. **Validate**: Run the frontmatter validator to ensure the category file is still valid:

   ```bash
   cd scripts/frontmatter-validator
   npm install
   node frontmatter-validator.js ../../categories/[folder]/[category-file].md
   ```

### Quick Reference

When asked to "add this rule to a category":

1. Look at the rule's topic and content
2. Navigate to `/categories/[appropriate-folder]/`
3. Find or choose the best matching category file
4. Add the rule's URI to the `index` array in that category file
5. Validate with the frontmatter validator
