# The SSW Rules content
Welcome to SSW.Rules.Content (The Data in markdown) 

## Structure
- Each rule has a folder containing rule.md and images/assets
- Rules are organised into categories
- A rule can belong to multiple categories
- category pages link to rules via frontmatter data
- rules live in the rules folder
- categories live in the categories folder

## content-migration branches
This content will be migrated from sharepoint including change history.
While we are testing this process, we will use numbered content-migration-xx branches.
When we are feature complete, one of these branches will merge to master to become the new trunk for all future changes.
