### Pull Requests, Builds and Releases

Builds are done in AzureDevOps, after a rule is edited a Pull Request is created you must wait for a Rule Master to accept it. There are about 15 of them and they all work at SSW. 
* To see the Pull Requests that are outstanding see here:  https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Rules.Content/pulls
* Pipelines - Once they have been merged, you can see them being built here: https://ssw.visualstudio.com/SSW.Rules/_build
* Releases - Once they have been built, you can see them being deployed here https://ssw.visualstudio.com/SSW.Rules/_release


## Structure
- Rules live in the rules folder
- Categories live in the categories folder
- Each rule has a folder containing rule.md and images/assets
- Rules are organised into categories
- A rule can belong to multiple categories
- Category pages link to rules via frontmatter data
