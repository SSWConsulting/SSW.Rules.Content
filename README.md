## Pull Requests, Builds and Releases

Builds are done in GitHub Actions. After a rule is edited, a Pull Request is needed to be merged into the `main` branch and deployed to Production.  

PRs can be approved by [anyone at SSW](https://www.ssw.com.au/people/). Try these people first:

1. Tiago Araujo
2. Brady Stroud
3. Adam Cogan
4. Luke Cook
5. Brook Jeynes

[See the outstanding Pull Requests](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Rules.Content/pulls).  
Once they have been merged, you can [see them being built and deployed](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Rules/actions/workflows/build-deploy-production.yml).

ðŸ“˜ GitHub Actions documentation for the projects is available in the [Wiki](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Rules.Content/wiki).

* Each rule has a folder containing rule.md and images/assets
* Rules are organised into categories
* A rule can belong to multiple categories
