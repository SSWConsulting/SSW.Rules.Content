When there are key words that you want people to notice, you can add a spot of color on the important word for emphasis.

<endIntro />

You should make parts of the text different colors just like you’d highlight or boldface parts of a sentence. The duo colored text will help emphasize your message.

## Use color sparingly

While a spot of color can guide attention and improve scannability, overusing color has the opposite effect. If everything is emphasized, nothing stands out.

Too many bright or contrasting elements:

* Create visual noise, making the UI feel cluttered and overwhelming
* Reduce readability and accessibility, especially for users with visual impairments
* Make it harder for users to know what truly matters

Stick to one accent colors per screen or section. Use them intentionally—only for elements that truly require user focus.

## Avoid using color for full sentences, even if it's just one word

Color should be used to emphasize **keywords** or **short phrases** within a sentence — not to style entire statements.

    **Tip:** Instead of coloring a sentence, add a colored icon (like ✅ or ❌). This keeps the message clear and accessible while still providing visual emphasis.

Use color to guide, not to shout.
