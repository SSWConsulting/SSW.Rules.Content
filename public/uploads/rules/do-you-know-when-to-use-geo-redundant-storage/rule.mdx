seoDescription: Azure Storage offers redundant storage options to balance safety and
  cost. Choose between Locally Redundant Storage (LRS), Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS),
  or Read Access Geo-Redundant Storage (RA-GRS) based on data importance, recovery
  requirements, and governance needs.

Data in Azure Storage accounts is protected by replication. Deciding how far to replicate it is a balance between safety and cost.

<endOfIntro />

### Locally redundant storage (LRS)

* Maintains three copies of your data.
* Is replicated three times within a single facility in a single region.
* Protects your data from normal hardware failures, but not from the failure of a single facility.
* Less expensive than GRS
* Use when:

  * Data is of low importance – e.g. for test websites, or testing virtual machines
  * Data can be easily reconstructed
  * Data is non-critical
  * Data governance requirements restrict data to a single region

### Geo-redundant storage (GRS)

* The default when you create storage accounts.
* Maintains six copies of your data.
* Data is replicated three times within the primary region, and is also replicated three times in a secondary region hundreds of miles away from the primary region
* In the event of a failure at the primary region, Azure Storage will failover to the secondary region.
* Ensures that your data is durable in two separate regions.
* Use when:

  * Data cannot be recovered if lost

### Read access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)

* Replicates your data to a secondary geographic location (same as GRS)
* Provides read access to your data in the secondary location
* Allows you to access your data from either the primary or the secondary location, in the event that one location becomes unavailable.
* Use when:

  * Data is critical, and access is required to both the primary and the secondary regions
