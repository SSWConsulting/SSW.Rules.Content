It’s easy sometimes to accidentally undersell something or someone by using potentially derogatory words that may give a client the wrong idea.

<endIntro />

This can be especially bad if you’re using potentially triggering words or phrases:

&gt; XXX is more junior/less experienced/less skilled than YYY.
**❌ Bad Example – Why are they paying for a junior, a less experienced, less skilled person?**  

&gt; XXX is more affordable than YYY.
**✅ Good Example – Avoids trigger words like “junior” and has a positive spin and an upside for a client.**  

&gt; XXX needs more time to learn this technology.
**❌ Bad Example – Why are they paying for someone to learn?**  

&gt; There’s always a short period of upskilling in any project until everyone’s fully proficient in the whole stack.
**✅ Good Example – Normalizes the issue**
