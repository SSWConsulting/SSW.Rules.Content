It’s easy sometimes to accidentally undersell something or someone by using potentially derogatory words that may give a client the wrong idea.
  </>}
/>
This can be especially bad if you’re using potentially triggering words or phrases:

> XXX is more junior/less experienced/less skilled than YYY.

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: 'Bad Example – Why are they paying for a junior, a less experienced, less skilled person?',
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


> XXX is more affordable than YYY.

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: 'Good Example – Avoids trigger words like “junior” and has a positive spin and an upside for a client.',
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


> XXX needs more time to learn this technology.

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: 'Bad Example – Why are they paying for someone to learn?',
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


> There’s always a short period of upskilling in any project until everyone’s fully proficient in the whole stack.

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: 'Good Example – Normalizes the issue',
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />
