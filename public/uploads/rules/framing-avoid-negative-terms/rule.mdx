It’s easy sometimes to accidentally undersell something or someone by using potentially derogatory words that may give a client the wrong idea.

<endOfIntro />

This can be especially bad if you’re using potentially triggering words or phrases:

> XXX is more junior/less experienced/less skilled than YYY.
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Bad Example – Why are they paying for a junior, a less experienced, less skilled person?",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


> XXX is more affordable than YYY.
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "Good Example – Avoids trigger words like “junior” and has a positive spin and an upside for a client.",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


> XXX needs more time to learn this technology.
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Bad Example – Why are they paying for someone to learn?",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


> There’s always a short period of upskilling in any project until everyone’s fully proficient in the whole stack.
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "Good Example – Normalizes the issue",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />
