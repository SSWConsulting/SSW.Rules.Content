Usually, when someone makes a suggestion or a complaint... you only hear from the ones who disagree. If you agree with someone, it helps to let others on the thread know. Simply reply with "+1" and a quick sentence.

**From:** Gary\
**To:** Code Auditor Team\
**Subject:** CodeAuditor rule files

Hi, I saw two clients today that complained about CodeAuditor rule files being created even though one had already existed. They were all named x.SSWCodeAuditor where x was a number from 1 to 13 in one of the cases. Why do these keep being created?

    **Note:** Outlook and most instant messaging apps now support ‚Äúlike‚Äù (üëç) reactions, which are a quick way to show support or agreement. However, using +1 with a short comment is more powerful‚Äîit not only signals agreement but also adds your input, making the conversation clearer and more valuable to others.
