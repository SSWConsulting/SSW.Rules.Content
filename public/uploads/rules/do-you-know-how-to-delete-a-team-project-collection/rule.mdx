  Reporting Services sites to free up server resources.

When you initially set up a TFS server, you may add a Team Project Collection for testing purposes. After you have confirmed TFS, SharePoint, and Reporting services are all working, you want to remove the test collection you made, but alas, there is no Delete option for project collections.

To delete the unwanted Team Project Collection:

1. On your TFS server, open an
   **Administrative Command Prompt**
2. Change into the TFS Tools Directory. Type:

```bash
cd "%programfiles%\microsoft team foundation server 2010\tools"
```

3. Type in the following (replacing [COLLECTION NAME] with the collection you want to delete):

```bash
TFSConfig Collection /delete /collectionName:[COLLECTION NAME]
```

1. Open the URL of your Team Project Collections SharePoint portal (eg. northwind.com.au/tfs/TestProjectCollection)
2. Select
   **Site Actions** |
   **Site Settings** on the right
3. Under the
   **Site Administration** subheading, click on
   **Delete this site**
4. Confirm the deletion

If you created a Reports site for your Team Project Collection, you should clean it up as well.

1. Open the URL of your Reporting Services page (eg. tfs.ssw.com.au/reports)
2. Click on the
   **TfsReports** folder
3. Click on the name of the Team Project Collections folder
4. Click
   **Properties** in the top navigation
5. Click on
   **Delete**

Now your TFS server is nice and clean and fit for production.
