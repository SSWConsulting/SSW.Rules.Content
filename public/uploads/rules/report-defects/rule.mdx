  body={<>
When a defect occurs in an office (e.g. a broken coffee machine, faulty air conditioning, or leaking tap), it’s crucial to report it with enough detail so that the Property Manager can take quick and accurate action.  Many issues get delayed or mishandled because the initial report is missing key details like **location**, **urgency**, or **who has been informed**.

Good reporting not only helps the Property Manager resolve issues faster, it also improves **turnaround time (TAT)**, **feedback**, and **follow-up communication**.

When reporting a defect, always make sure your message is **clear**, **complete**, and **actionable**.

## Create a PBI (YakShave it)

* For traceability, **create a PBI (Product Backlog Item)** in your maintenance backlog titled **“Defect –  &#123;&#123; Brief Description &#125;&#125;**
* Link the PBI in your message so others can track progress and updates\
  **Example:** _“Created PBI: [Defect – Broken coffee machine in SSW France kitchen](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Maintenance/issues/1)”_


<asideEmbed
  variant="info"
  body={<>
    **Note:** [YakShaving](https://yakshaver.ai/)” each defect into a **PBI** will ensure property issues are logged, tracked, and resolved efficiently — saving time, reducing confusion, and improving everyone’s work environment.

### Key details to be included

#### 1. Location

Start broad and zoom in:

* Office name → floor → area → exact item\
  **Example:** _“SSW Brisbane→ First floor → Kitchen area → The counter next to the sink”_

#### 2. Urgency and impact

Does the defect affect your **productivity** or **safety**?  If yes:

* Clearly state the impact\
  **Example:** _“Can’t use meeting room due to flickering lights”_

* Mention any temporary fix you’ve applied\
  **Example:** _“Taped over the exposed wire until repaired”_

#### 3. Ensure you inform responsible parties

Inform the people who is aware of the problem. Always include:

* The **Head of Office**
* The **Property Manager**


<asideEmbed
  variant="info"
  body={<>
    **Tip:** Use @mentions int the PBI, or if you’re reporting via Teams or email, e.g. _“@John Smith @Sarah Jones”_.
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>


#### 4. Historic information

* Note any past occurrences or related maintenance\
  **Example:** _“Coffee Machine keeps jamming; it was repaired in last month with the same issue”_

Consistency in reporting helps ensure that all offices communicate defects in the same clear way — improving turnaround time, transparency, and accountability.
