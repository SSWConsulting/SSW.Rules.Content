When asking for changes on a web page, Word document, PowerPoint slide, or code, always use "Change from X to Y".

This process consists of including the original version of the content ("X") along with the changes you require ("Y"). It means you easily see the page or file content as it was prior to your changes. This history is convenient for **future reference** and also **makes it very clear** to the person doing the changes exactly what the new file is meant to look like.

## Using email for small edits

Make the changes even easier to see and understand by highlighting:

* In <mark>yellow</mark> - Content you want to add/update (only do this on the "To" section)
* In <span style="background-color:#ff0000;color:#fff;font-weight:bolder;">red</span> (with white and bold text) Content you want to delete, whether it be specific text or an entire sentence (only do this on the "From" section)
  **Note:** Only indicate in red the content that will **not** be replaced/updated with something correlated.

**Note:** All text we do not write ourselves [should be indented](/do-you-use-indentation-for-readability), so this includes paragraphs we are copying and pasting.

### Tip #1: Microsoft Teams - Use the same X to Y style


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'Using change from x to y in Microsoft Teams',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/change-from-x-to-y/change-from-x-to-y-microsoft-teams.jpg"
/>

**Note:** Microsoft Teams doesn't currently allow you to set the font color to white

### Tip #2: Microsoft Outlook - Add a style to make delete highlightings easy


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'Remember when saving the style to select "New documents based off this template"',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/change-from-x-to-y/change-from-x-to-y-saving-styles.jpg"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'The style will show in your styles list to be applied when needed',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/change-from-x-to-y/change-from-x-to-y-using-styles.jpg"
/>

**Tip:** You can right click to bring up the format text toolbar

**Tip:** By default, saved styles are ordered alphabetically. Add numbering in their name to customize their order of appearance

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: 'Bad example – Custom styles are disorganised',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/change-from-x-to-y/change-from-x-to-y-organising-styles-bad-example.png"
/>

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: 'Good example – Custom styles are numbered and organised',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}

## Alternative - What if there are too many changes?

Sometimes you have a lot of content and too many changes, making the process "from X to Y" too arduous. In this case is recommended to use [Word 'Track Changes'](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/track-changes-in-word-197ba630-0f5f-4a8e-9a77-3712475e806a?ui=en-us&rs=en-gb&ad=gb) functionality.

  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'A Word document with \'Track Changes\' ON is recommended if you have too many changes',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/change-from-x-to-y/word-track-changes.jpg"
/>

## Alternative - What if you have a website managed by GitHub?

Some websites use GitHub to manage their files (e.g. [SSW Rules](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Rules.Content)). GitHub makes reviewing changes easy through "Pull Requests".


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}

    preset: "default",
    figure: 'This visual preview of the changes to a Markdown file in GitHub',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}

    **Note:** When highlighting text in HTML/Markdown you [should avoid &lt;font&gt; tags](/do-you-know-font-tags-are-no-longer-used). Use &lt;span&gt; instead.
