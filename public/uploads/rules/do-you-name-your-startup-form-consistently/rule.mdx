  body={<>
In every Windows application project, we need to have a main, start-up or wizard page form for a better structure and design.
  </>}
/>
![Bad Project without Main Form](/uploads/rules/do-you-name-your-startup-form-consistently/BadMainForm.gif) Bad example - The entry form is not immediately recognizable because of a non standard name ![Good with Main Form](/uploads/rules/do-you-name-your-startup-form-consistently/GoodMainForm.gif) Good example - The entry form follows the naming convention rule

| We have a program called [SSW Code Auditor](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/Default.aspx#VBMainForm) to check for this rule.

| Note: In Code Auditor we check for Form named: Startup, MainForm and WizardPage. |
