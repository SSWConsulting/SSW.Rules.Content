In an IT industry, there should be a provision to RDP into servers or VMs to access them when needed. Within an organization, it is easier to remotely access laptops or computers connected to the same network.

To RDP, enable Remote desktop in settings [How to enable Remote Desktop](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/how-to-use-remote-desktop-5fe128d5-8fb1-7a23-3b8a-41e636865e8c). Windows has Microsoft Remote desktop connection application inbuilt to RDP to another computer.

### Drawbacks of using Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection

- Every time you need to RDP, you have to manually type the IP address or computer name
- List of IPs or device names is not available
