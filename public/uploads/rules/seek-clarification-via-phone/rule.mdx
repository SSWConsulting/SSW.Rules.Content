Sometimes you get a cryptic email and think... _"what on earth!?"_ In those cases, a quick call (on Teams or a phone) can solve most of your troubles.

We've all received a cryptic email at some point. Simply replying _"I don't understand"_ is not productive. Call the person who sent the email instead. Chances are if the sender of the task couldn't explain the task well enough the first time, it's likely a voice conversation is needed to clarify the issue.

<endOfIntro />

Having clarified the issue by phone, update the task by replying to the original email with the new details arising from the conversation. Remember to start with ["As per our conversation"](/as-per-our-conversation-emails).

  to="Dave"
  cc=""
  bcc=""
  subject="RE: Northwind App - Changes to UI"
  shouldDisplayBody={true}
  body={<>
    ## Hi Dave

As per our conversation, I needed a bit more information to complete this task. As discussed, in the future so I don't have to bother you, please send me as much information about a task as possible.

## To Myself

&#123;&#123; INFO YOU'VE GOT FROM THE CONVERSATION &#125;&#125;

Regards,
Denise

However, sometimes you cannot immediately reach the task owner. In this case, you should try to contact the person a few more times. If you are still not able to contact them, you should reply to the email and state it in the first line:

  from=""
  to="Dave"

  bcc=""
  subject="RE: Northwind App - Changes to UI"
  shouldDisplayBody={true}
  body={<>
    ## Hi Dave

I tried to call but couldn't get hold of you.

I need a bit more information to complete this task. To make sure we understand the task, in the future, can you please clarify the additional information as the example below:

&#123;&#123; WHAT NEEDS CLARIFICATION &#125;&#125;

### What if you need to send a complex email?

If you ever sent an email and got a response saying it's too cryptic it is because you didn't include enough details. That's why it's important to always [add context and reasoning to emails](/do-you-add-context-reasoning-to-your-emails).
