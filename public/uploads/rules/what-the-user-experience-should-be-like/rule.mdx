Here are a couple of examples of Check for Updates results:

  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: "Bad example - Skype does a good job, with a green tick and simple message. The actual version number would have made it more complete",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }

/>


<imageEmbed

  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: "Bad example - Snagit has horrible UI (red text when it is not an error and Hyperlinks without underlines), however the link to the latest features is not bad",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }

/>


<imageEmbed

#### More Information

If you implement this code from the SSW Toolkit, you will get this UI:

![Figure 2: Confirmation that they already have the latest version](/uploads/rules/what-the-user-experience-should-be-like/diagnosticsupdater02.jpg)

![Figure 3: The simple prompt to upgrade when a new version is available](/uploads/rules/what-the-user-experience-should-be-like/diagnosticsupdater03.jpg)

![Figure 4: Showing the upgrading progress](/uploads/rules/what-the-user-experience-should-be-like/diagnosticsupdater04.jpg)

![Figure 5: Restarting the application is required because the new version will not take affect until quit and launch the app again](/uploads/rules/what-the-user-experience-should-be-like/diagnosticsupdater05.jpg)
