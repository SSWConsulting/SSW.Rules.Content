title: Backup - Do you set up a complete Maintenance Plan?

It is surprising how many IT staff create backup plans and then leave it at that. To have a complete maintenance plan, you should also consider the following:

1. Checking database integrity
2. Shrinking Databases
3. Reorganizing Indexes
4. Rebuilding Indexes
5. Updating Statistics
6. Cleaning up old maintenance histories
7. Performing automatic backups
8. Backing up System databases
9. Last but not least - you should regularly check that the maintenance plans have been running successfully. Otherwise, all your backup and maintenance efforts are pointless

This can be found under **Management | Maintenance Plans** within the database tee in SQL Server.
