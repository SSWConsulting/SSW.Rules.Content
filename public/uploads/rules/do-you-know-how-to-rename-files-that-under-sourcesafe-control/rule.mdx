Whenever we rename a file in Visual Studio .NET, the file becomes a new file in SourceSafe. If the file has been checked-out, the status of old file will remain as checked-out in SourceSafe.

The step by step to rename a file that under SourceSafe control:
1. Save and close the file in Visual Studio .NET, and check in the file if it is checked-out.
2. Open Visual SourceSafe Explorer and rename the file.
3. Rename it in Visual Studio .NET, click "Continue with change" to the 2 pop-up messages:

  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'Warning message of renaming files under source control.',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-how-to-rename-files-that-under-sourcesafe-control/RenameVSS1_small.jpg"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'You are seeing this as the new file name already exists in SourceSafe, just click "Continue with change".',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-how-to-rename-files-that-under-sourcesafe-control/RenameVSS2_small.jpg"
/>

Visual Studio .NET should find the file under source control and it will come up with a lock icon
