Whenever we rename a file in Visual Studio .NET, the file becomes a new file in SourceSafe. If the file has been checked-out, the status of old file will remain as checked-out in SourceSafe.

The step by step to rename a file that under SourceSafe control:

<endOfIntro />

1. Save and close the file in Visual Studio .NET, and check in the file if it is checked-out.
2. Open Visual SourceSafe Explorer and rename the file.
3. Rename it in Visual Studio .NET, click "Continue with change" to the 2 pop-up messages:

  captionText={"Warning message of renaming files under source control."}
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-how-to-rename-files-that-under-sourcesafe-control/RenameVSS1_small.jpg"
/>



<imageEmbed

  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  captionStyle="default"
  captionText={"You are seeing this as the new file name already exists in SourceSafe, just click \"Continue with change\"."}
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-how-to-rename-files-that-under-sourcesafe-control/RenameVSS2_small.jpg"
/>


Visual Studio .NET should find the file under source control and it will come up with a lock icon
