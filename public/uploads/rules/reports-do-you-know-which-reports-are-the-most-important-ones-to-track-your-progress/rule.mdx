In Scrum there is only one report that the team needs to track their progress.

    preset: "default",
    figure: 'The burndown has all of the information you need to know if you are going to hit your mark',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}

/>

There are however other reports that matter for management and putting together the bigger picture.
