Complexity is a necessary evil in any software project. To make things work, you've gotta have some concepts that, when understood, are used to make it work.

However, the mark of a great engineer/engineering team is to only ever opt into the minimal amount of complexity possible while constantly driving down whatever complexity currently exists.

## What is Complexity?

Complexity is the total sum of all the different concepts in any given system. Now in order for this to really make sense we need to define what we mean by a “concept”.

> "A distinct piece of knowledge would cause someone to be blocked if they didn't have it."

So, with this definition we can start to examine our software projects and see how complicated they really are. Now, notably there's nothing in this definition that says that a concept has to be a “package”, “library”, or anything that's specifically tied to something you can point at. So, Next.js would be a concept. But, so would Clean Architecture, cross-field validation, the redux pattern, etc.
