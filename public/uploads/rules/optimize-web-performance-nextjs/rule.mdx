Next.js is a popular and powerful framework built on top of React, designed to help teams build fast, scalable web applications. 

Without a performance-first approach, applications can quickly become slow due to excessive client-side Javascript, inefficient data fetching or incorrect rendering strategies. Out of the box, Next.js gives you powerful performance tools.

### Factors That Affect Web Performance

Web performance in Next.js is commonly the result of multiple choices made throughout the application: 

* Rendering Strategy - choosing between static, server-rendered or dynamic pages directly impacts load time and responsiveness 
* JavaScript sent to the browser - Larger client bundles increase parse and execution time, delaying interactivity 
* Data fetching patterns - Client-side fetching often causes request waterfalls, while server-side fetching enables faster initial renders 
* Caching and revalidation - explicit caching reduces repeated work and improves response time 
* Images, fonts, and media - unoptimized assets are frequently the largest contributor to slow page loads (Impacts Core Web Vitals such as Largest Contentful Paint)
* Layout Stability - Unexpected layout shifts degrade user experience and negatively impact Cumulative Layout Shift metrics 
* Hydration and Interactivity - Hydrating more UI than necessary increases CPU cost and delays interaction

### Optimizing Web Performance

#### 1. Display Images with the built in Next.js Component

Next.js provides an inbuilt [\<Image/>](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image) component, which extends the native HTML \<img> element for optimization.
