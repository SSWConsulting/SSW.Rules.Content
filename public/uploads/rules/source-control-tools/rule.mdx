Source control tools are essential for software developers. They enable the tracking of changes made to a project's source code, facilitate collaboration among developers, and ensure the project's consistency.

<endOfIntro />

### ✅ Advantages of Version Control Software

- **Project Consistency Assurance:** Keeps a record of all changes made to a project's source code. This allows reverting to a previous version of the code in case of problems
- **Facilitating Collaboration:** Allows developers to work simultaneously on the same project without the risk of conflict. They provide a centralized repository for storing and managing source code
- **Improving Productivity:** Can enhance developers' productivity by automating tasks like creating branches and tracking changes, and by abstracting the use of the console for most common actions
- **Reducing Risks:** Can help reduce risks associated with software development. They can assist in identifying and fixing bugs more quickly, and they can also help protect projects from data loss
- **Improving Code Quality:** Can help improve code quality by encouraging developers to write cleaner and more maintainable code
- **Promoting Communication:** Can help promote communication among developers. They provide a way for developers to share their changes and collaborate on projects

### ❌ Disadvantages of Version Control Software

- **Complexity:** Version control software can be complex to learn and use. This can be a barrier for beginner developers
- **Cost:** Commercial version control software can be expensive. However, many free open-source solutions are available
- **Performance:** Version control software can negatively impact the performance of the systems they are used on. This is particularly true for large projects
- **Security:** Version control software can be vulnerable to attacks. It is important to take security measures to protect the data stored in a version control repository

    **🧐 Did you know?**
One of the earliest version control systems, named **SCCS (Source Code Control System)**, was developed by Marc J. Rochkind at Bell Labs in 1972. At that time, the need to efficiently manage changes to source code was just beginning to emerge in the software industry.
This system enabled the tracking of revisions for individual files, a significant innovation for its time. It's from these early initiatives that modern version control tools like Git and Mercurial have evolved, offering far more advanced features and collaborative code management capabilities.

### GitKraken

[GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) is a renowned suite of developer tools designed to enhance productivity in software development. It has been evolving for nearly a decade, reflecting a continuous commitment to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of developers and their teams. GitKraken began with desktop-centric and IDE-based tools, like the GitKraken Client and GitLens for Visual Studio Code, both of which have become integral to the workflows of tens of millions of developers worldwide​​.

The company behind GitKraken, Axosoft, has been recognized for its significant contributions to the developer community. For instance, Eric Amodio, the Chief Technology Officer at GitKraken, was awarded the Microsoft MVP Award for Developer Technologies in 2023. This award highlights his exceptional contributions to the developer community, particularly through GitLens, a popular Git extension for Visual Studio Code created by Amodio in 2016. GitLens has become a crucial tool in the daily coding processes of millions of developers, with its installation numbers surpassing 23 million.

GitKraken emerges as a visually appealing, user-friendly Git client, making it an excellent choice for those new to Git or preferring a GUI over command-line operations. Its graphical interface, ease of use, and integration capabilities are significant strengths. However, its performance with large repositories, the freemium model, and some missing features like GCM support are noteworthy drawbacks. For developers and teams considering a GUI for Git, GitKraken presents a compelling option, especially if the project scale and the need for advanced features align with what GitKraken offers.

### Fork

[Fork](https://git-fork.com/) is a Git client software designed to provide an efficient and user-friendly experience for handling version control tasks.
