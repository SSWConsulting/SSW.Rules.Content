ChatGPT's knowledge is cut off in September 2021, meaning it can't provide real-time or updated information beyond that date. It also can't interact with web content or perform complex computations on its own.

This is where ChatGPT plugins come into play. These powerful tools extend the capabilities of ChatGPT, enabling it to perform tasks such as browsing the web for the most recent information, interpreting content from various digital resources, and even performing complex computations. By leveraging these plugins, you can overcome the limitations of ChatGPT and significantly enhance its utility in the workplace.

Here's a rundown of some of the most useful plugins and how they can be beneficial in a work context.
### Inbuilt Browser Support in ChatGPT

ChatGPT has a built-in browser support that can perform searches on Bing to fetch up-to-date information. It's designed to pull in information from the web in real-time during a conversation. It's useful for quick lookups, fact-checking, or when you need to pull in fresh data from the web to answer a question.

For example, if you're asking about the current weather, the latest news, or recent sports scores, the native browsing functionality of ChatGPT would be used to fetch this real-time information. It's also used for general web searches when the assistant needs to pull in information from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive answer.

  body={<>
    "Hey ChatGPT, can you find the latest news on AI advancements?"
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: 'Figure: Good example - Using inbuilt browser support to fetch latest information',
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


### WebPilot

WebPilot is used when there's a need to interact with a webpage in a more dynamic way. It can simulate browsing actions like clicking on links, filling out forms, or navigating through a website's pages. It's useful when the information you need can't be accessed directly from a single URL, but requires some interaction with the webpage. It can also be useful for some basic SEO advice.

For example, if you need to retrieve data that is behind a form submission or requires navigating through a multi-page article, WebPilot would be the appropriate tool to use.

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    "Hey WebPilot, can you search for the latest research papers on this website and provide the titles and authors of the top 5 results?"
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: 'Figure: Good example - Using WebPilot to interact with search results on a specific website',
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    "Hey WebPilot, can you go to this forum thread and tell me what the most upvoted comment is?"
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: 'Figure: Good example - Using WebPilot to navigate a forum and retrieve specific information',
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


### Link Reader

Link Reader, on the other hand, is more focused on extracting and interpreting information from a single static link. It's designed to understand and synthesize information from various digital resources, including web pages, PDF documents, PowerPoint presentations, images, Word files, and more. It's particularly useful when you need to read, summarize, or analyze the content of a specific link.

For instance, if you have a URL to a specific online article or a PDF document and you want to get a summary or detailed understanding of its content, Link Reader would be the tool to use.

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    "Hey Link Reader, can you interpret the content of this research paper for me?"
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: 'Figure: Good example - Using Link Reader to interpret a research paper',
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    "Hey Link Reader, can you analyze this PowerPoint presentation and tell me the main points of each slide?"
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: 'Figure: Good example - Using Link Reader to analyze a PowerPoint presentation',
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


### AskYourPDF

If you have a PDF on your machine, not online, use AskYourPDF. It can open and read PDF files, extract text, figures, tables, and even metadata from them. It's an essential tool when you need to access, interpret, or summarize content from a PDF document.

For instance, if you have a PDF report and you need to extract certain tables or sections, or if you want to understand the overall content without going through the whole document, AskYourPDF is the perfect tool for the job.

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    "Hey AskYourPDF, can you extract the tables from this annual report?"

"Hey AskYourPDF, can you give me a summary of this PDF thesis?"

  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: 'Figure: Good examples - Using AskYourPDF to extract information from a PDF, or for a summary',
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


### Prompt Perfect

Prompt Perfect is a plugin that helps in crafting effective prompts for ChatGPT. It's a great tool when you're unsure how to phrase your prompts to get the best responses.

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    "Hey Prompt Perfect, how should I phrase a prompt to get a summary of a book?"
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: 'Figure: Good example - Using Prompt Perfect to craft effective prompts',
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


### Wolfram Alpha

Wolfram Alpha plugin allows you to perform complex computations and fetch factual information. It's like having a powerful calculator and a fact-checker in one place.

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    "Hey Wolfram Alpha, what's the integral of x^2 from 0 to 1?"
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: 'Figure: Good example - Using Wolfram Alpha for complex computations',
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


### Show Me

Show Me is a plugin that generates visual content based on your prompts. It can be used to create diagrams, flowcharts, and other visual aids that can enhance understanding.

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    "Hey Show Me, can you create a flowchart for the project management process?"
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: 'Figure: Good example - Using Show Me to create visual aids',
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


### Video Insights

Video Insights is a plugin that can extract key insights from videos. It's a great tool when you need to understand the content of a video without watching the entire thing.

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    "Hey Video Insights, can you give me the key points from this TED talk?"
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: 'Figure: Good example - Using Video Insights to extract key points from a video',
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


Remember, the best plugin to use depends on the task at hand. By understanding what each plugin can do, you can choose the most effective tool for your needs.
