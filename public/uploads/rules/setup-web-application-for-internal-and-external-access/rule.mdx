- default zone should be over http, this is so search can access it over non-secure connection
- default zone should not be accessible outside of internal network
- extend the web application to an internet zone, this should be https to provide secure connection

- this section should be extended with strategy to work with reverse proxy.

<endIntro />

Reverse proxy handle https connection to client, and connects to SharePoint via http to reduce https overhead on SharePoint

SharePoint also needs to support https for internal traffic, if I click on a link to HTTPS it should work internally

For this scenario to work, web application needs to be extended 2 to 3 different zone

**Default**  (http for internal and search)

**Internet**  (http for reverse proxy)

**Intranet**  (https for internal https link)
