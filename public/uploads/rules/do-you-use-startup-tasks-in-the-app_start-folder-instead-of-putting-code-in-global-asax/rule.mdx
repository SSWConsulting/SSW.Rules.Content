seoDescription: Organize ASP.NET startup logic by using the App_Start folder instead
  of Global.asax to maintain cleaner code and follow Single Responsibility principles.
title: Do you use startup tasks in the ~/App_Start folder instead of putting code
  in Global.asax?

Adding code to the Application\_Start method in the Global.asax file is the easiest and most straight-forward approach for executing startup logic, however, this code should be encapsulated in static methods outside the Global.asax file. Doing this helps provide cleaner code and encourages proper adherence to the Single Responsibility principle.

``` cs
public class MvcApplication : System.Web.HttpApplication
{
    protected void Application_Start()
    {
        AreaRegistration.RegisterAllAreas();

        routes.IgnoreRoute("{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}");

        routes.MapRoute(
            name: "Default",
            url: "{controller}/{action}/{id}",
            defaults: new { controller = "Home", action = "Index", id = UrlParameter.Optional }
        );        }
}
```
