seoDescription: Do you share code using packages? VSTS helps devs share source or
  binaries across their organization by caching and centralizing packages.

Devs need a way of sharing and consuming the source code or binaries.

VSTS is the best home to put it and share it across their organization because:

<endOfIntro />

- It caches your packages
- It's a centralized place for your packages
- It's constantly evolving (some really cool features check the video below)

**✅ Good example**

    VSTS is about to add benefits like Component Governance, which allows policies to be set over who can and cannot use the source or binaries E.g. Licensing (MIT might be ok and GPL not ok), security - in development

- At 2:50 Mario Rodriguez talks about the bad ways customers share code
- At 6:30 Mario explains to Danijel Malik how VSTS helps with the nasty problem of Diamond Dependencies (aka Binary Consumption Hell) (E.g. That's when devs are trying to get the new version of say Newtonsoft v1.9 in all projects, but one at a time)
