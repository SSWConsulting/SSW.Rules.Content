seoDescription: Striking through completed tasks helps track progress and provides
  a sense of accomplishment.

When you're giving an update on progress on a task list or a schedule, ~~strike out~~ the items that have been completed. Not only does it visually explain where you are, it also gives you a great sense of satisfaction...
