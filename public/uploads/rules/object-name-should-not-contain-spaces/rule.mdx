Spaces should be avoided. If an object name contains a space, it can cause problems later on for developers because the developer must remember to put the object name inside square brackets when referencing it.

Read this article: [Worst Practice - Spaces in Object Names](https://www.sqlservercentral.com/articles/worst-practice-spaces-in-object-names).

We aim to never have to use square brackets in any of our databases.
