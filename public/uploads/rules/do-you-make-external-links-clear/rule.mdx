<introEmbed
  body={<>
When creating links, you should follow a few basic rules:
  </>}
/>
- If your link is an **internal** link, then it should keep the default behaviour, navigating within the same tab
- If the link is **external**, it should:
  - [Open in a new tab](/external-links-open-on-a-new-tab)
  - Be visually clear to the user that it will lead them away from the current site, that way it is not a surprise.


<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    [Google](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Redirect/Web/Google.htm) is by far the best but try other search engines as well.
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: "Bad example - Without visual indication",
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
/>

### How to add the external link indicator?

It should be inserted by CSS as following:

```css
a[href*=&quot;//&quot;]&#58;not([href*=&quot;mysite.com&quot;]):after {
content&#58; url(https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/images/external.gif);
padding-left: 4px;
}
```

**Figure: Icon can be added via CSS using a simple declaration**
