When creating links, you should follow a few basic rules:

<endIntro />

- If your link is an **internal** link, then it should keep the [default underline](/underlined-links) behaviour, navigating within the same tab
- If the link is **external**, it should:
  - [Open in a new tab](/external-links-open-on-a-new-tab)
  - [Have an icon](/use-icons-to-not-surprise-users) to clearly indicate that the link leads away from the current site

    [Google](https://google.com) is by far the best but try other search engines as well.
