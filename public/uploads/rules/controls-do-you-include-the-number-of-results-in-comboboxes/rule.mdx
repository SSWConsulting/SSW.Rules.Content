When designing your form, you should try to help your user whenever it's possible. So it's a good idea to include the number of results in ComboBoxes.

### For Windows Forms

    preset: "badExample",
    figure: "Bad example - You can't tell the number of results and there is a scroll bar",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }

  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good example - The number of results is clearly displayed. Long text boxes larger than 30 entries, another approach can be employed - putting the common ones at the top",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }

  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: "Bad example - Firstly because it is manual, plus what about the 4th, 5th, etc most common used countries",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }

  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: "Bad example – This was a highly unpopular method of the sorting and counting above",

We believe all combos should be able to be sorted ascending/descending and by popularity asc/desc.
