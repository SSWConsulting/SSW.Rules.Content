- placing shared filters in your favouries with [Manage Filters](/do-you-know-how-to-track-requests-in-jira)
- creating your own filters and sharing them, do this with a [Find Issues](/do-you-know-how-to-track-requests-in-jira)and then save it as a filter and share it
- make shared dashboards your favourites and create new ones with [Manage Dashboards](/do-you-know-how-to-track-requests-in-jira)
