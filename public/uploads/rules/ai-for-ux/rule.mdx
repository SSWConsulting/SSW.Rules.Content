Leveraging AI tools across different stages of the UX process can speed up decision-making and free up time for critical thinking and creative problem solving.

<endIntro />

Here are some common (and powerful) ways to use AI across the entire UX lifecycle:

## UX research

AI can analyze data faster and surface patterns that might take hours (or days) to uncover manually.

* **[Dovetail](https://dovetail.com/)** – Automatically generates highlights, clusters insights, and summarises findings from interviews, surveys, and usability tests using AI
* **[UserTesting](https://www.usertesting.com/)** – Uses AI to analyse user video sessions, surfacing key patterns, pain points, and actionable insights with minimal manual effort
* **[Maze](https://maze.co/)** – AI-enhanced usability testing tool that provides instant reports and auto-summarised insights from user interactions and feedback

## Ideation & prototyping

Quickly move from idea to UI with tools that generate design assets or entire screens from simple inputs.

* **[Magician](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1184069065763242572/magician-design) (Figma plugin)** – An AI-powered design assistant in Figma that helps generate copy, icons, and design ideas from text prompts
* **[UIzard](https://uizard.io/)** – Transforms hand-drawn sketches or text descriptions into functional wireframes and high-fidelity UI mockups
* **[Stitch](https://stitch.withgoogle.com/) (formerly Galileo)** – Converts natural language prompts into clean, production-quality UI mockups
* **[v0](https://v0.dev/)** – Translates natural language prompts into fully functional React + Tailwind components, allowing designers and developers to instantly generate editable, production-ready UIs

## Content design

AI helps create consistent and clear copyfaster.

* **[Writer](https://writer.com/)** – An enterprise-grade AI writing assistant that ensures consistent UX copy across products by enforcing style guides, improving readability, and adapting to your brand voice
* **[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) / [Claude](https://claude.ai/)** – Great for writing microcopy, generating ideas, summarising research findings, and drafting early content – all from simple prompts

## Accessibility & QA

Catch compliance issues early with AI-powered checkers.

* **[Stark](https://www.getstark.co/) (Figma plugin)** – An accessibility checker for Figma, Sketch, and web that uses AI to detect colour contrast issues, missing alt text, and WCAG compliance gaps

## ✅ Best practices when using AI for UX

* **Validate output** – AI can hallucinate. Always review and test anything before going live
* **Use as a collaborator, not a crutch** – AI should support your creativity, not replace your judgment
* **Prompt wisely** – The better your input, the better the output. Be specific and provide context
* **Respect privacy** – Avoid feeding sensitive data into AI tools that don't guarantee security

**AI won't replace good UX.** But used properly, it can dramatically increase your output and quality. Think of it as an intelligent assistant that's always ready to help – just don't hand it the steering wheel.
