Sometimes a task will not be clear, or you won't have sufficient context to understand what is required.

A bad approach is to simply delete the email or to reply with “?” and then delete it.

What you should do is call the sender and ask for specifics, then reply to the email with an [as per our conversation](/do-you-send-as-per-our-conversation-emails), documenting your new understanding of the task.

If you can't get hold of the person, email them back asking specifics of what you don't understand.
