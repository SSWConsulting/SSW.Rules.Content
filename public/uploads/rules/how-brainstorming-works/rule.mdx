At an annual Brainstorming day, employees are invited to share their ideas, give feedback, and pick the best one to work on. The benefits of Brainstorming are [well understood](https://raybourn.com/the-5-benefits-of-brainstorming/), but to focus the productivity on something useful, it is important to have a system for suggesting, voting, and working on ideas. Brainstorming days also require a lot of preparation leading up to the day and follow-up work afterwards.

Here is the schedule that should be followed.

1. Book in a day - this should be done months before the Brainstorming day to allow time for planning and for people to think of ideas.
2. 4 weeks before - [Pre event - Idea Farming and refinement](/brainstorming-idea-farming)
3. 1 week before - [Pre event - Team allocation and setup](/brainstorming-team-allocation)
4. 1 day before - [Pre event - Brainstorming Intro Presentation](/brainstorming-intro-presentation)
5. [Brainstorming day agenda](/brainstorming-agenda)
6. [Post event - Brainstorming Retro](/brainstorming-day-retro)
