seoDescription: Dates and times of change displayed as tooltips on hover, providing
  additional context without cluttering the main interface.
title: Dates – Do you provide the date and time of change as a tooltip?

<introEmbed
  body={<>
Displaying the date and time of change as a tooltip when users hover over the time of change can be an effective approach for interfaces with limited space or when providing both pieces of information together could lead to confusion.

Tooltips allow users to access additional information about the context of the date and time of change without cluttering the main interface.
