When you look at the Service Calendar, you want to be able to see, at a glance, who is working on what.

To do this, the subject field of appointments should be as follows:

<endOfIntro />


<boxEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    **Client [Project] - Name[s]**
  </>}
  figurePreset="defaultExample"
  figureText={"XXX"}
/>


The project name (in parentheses) is optional and only used if there is more than one project happening simultaneously.

You can have 1 or many names, depending on the booking.


<boxEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    Go to ACME Corp\
Work onsite for ACME Corp\
Mehmet working at ACME Corp
  </>}
  figurePreset="badExampleExample"
  figureText={"Bad example - All inconsistent and hard to read"}
/>



<boxEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    ACME Corp - Mehmet\
ACME Corp - Mehmet, Dan\
ACME Corp (SharePoint) - Dan
  </>}
  figurePreset="defaultExample"
  figureText={"XXX"}
/>
