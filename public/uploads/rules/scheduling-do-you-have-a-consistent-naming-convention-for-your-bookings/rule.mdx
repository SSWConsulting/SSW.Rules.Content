When you look at the Service Calendar, you want to be able to see, at a glance, who is working on what.

To do this, the subject field of appointments should be as follows:
<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    **Client [Project] - Name[s]**
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

The project name (in parentheses) is optional and only used if there is more than one project happening simultaneously.

You can have 1 or many names, depending on the booking.

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    Go to ACME Corp\
Work onsite for ACME Corp\
Mehmet working at ACME Corp
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: 'Bad example - All inconsistent and hard to read',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
/>

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    ACME Corp - Mehmet\
ACME Corp - Mehmet, Dan\
ACME Corp (SharePoint) - Dan
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: 'Figure: Good example - Consistent details',
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />
