When you look at the Service Calendar, you want to be able to see, at a glance, who is working on what.

To do this, the subject field of appointments should be as follows:

<endOfIntro />


<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    **Client [Project] - Name[s]**
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>


The project name (in parentheses) is optional and only used if there is more than one project happening simultaneously.

You can have 1 or many names, depending on the booking.
