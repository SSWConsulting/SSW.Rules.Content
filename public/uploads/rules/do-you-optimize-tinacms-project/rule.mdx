Structuring and optimizing your TinaCMS project is essential to achieve clarity, enhance performance, and prevent build failures. Poorly optimized projects can lead to slow site performance, increased server load, and even failed builds due to excessive or inefficient data requests.

Let’s explore how to structure your project effectively and apply best practices to boost performance both in runtime and during the build process.

## 1. Structuring your TinaCMS Architecture

When working with large datasets or generating multiple subcomponents, following best practices is crucial to maintain performance and clarity.

### ❌ Bad practices

* **Use deeply nested schemas with nested references**

  * This increases the complexity of the project, making it harder to manage and more prone to build failures
  * It also leads to inefficient data fetching, further slowing down both runtime and build processes

### ✅ Good practices

* **Make a single request in a top-level server component and share data via React Context or a state library**

  * Fetch the data once at the top level and store it in a React Context or global state (e.g., [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)). This lets all components access the data without prop drilling, improves scalability, and eliminates redundant API calls.
```js
export default async function Home({ params }: HomePageProps) {
    const location = params.location;

    const websiteProps = await client.queries.website({
        relativePath: `${location}/website.md`,
    });

    const { conferencesData, footerData, speakers } = websiteProps.data;

    return (
        <ConferenceContext.Provider value={conferencesData}>
            <FooterContext.Provider value={footerData}>
                <PageTransition>
                    <HomeComponent speakers={speakers} />
                </PageTransition>
            </FooterContext.Provider>
        </ConferenceContext.Provider>
    );
}

export async function generateStaticParams() {
    const contentDir = path.join(process.cwd(), 'content/websites');
    const locations = await fs.readdir(contentDir);

    return locations.map((location) => ({ location }));
}
```

**✅ Code: `conferencesData` and `footerData` are provided through context, while `speakers` are passed directly to `HomeComponent` as props.****  

* **Cache data at a top-level and access it when necessary**

  * If passing props is not feasible (e.g., components relying on Next.js router data), fetch the data at a higher level, cache it, and access it directly within the component
  * This approach ensures efficient data retrieval and reduces the server load at build time

## 2. Improving Runtime Performance

Optimizing runtime performance is key to delivering a fast and responsive user experience.

### ❌ Bad practices

* **Use client-side requests instead of relying on cached data from build process**

  * This approach can negate the benefit of static site generation, where data is fetched and cached during the process
  * Making too many client-side requests increases server load and slows down the application

### ✅ Good practices

* **Use static site generation (SSG) with TinaCMS to fetch and cache data during builds**

  * Minimizes dynamic fetching and enhances performance
  * Faster load time
  * Less strain on the server

## 3. Improving Build Performance

To ensure smooth and reliable builds, it’s important to follow best practices that prevent excessive server load and manage data efficiently.

### ✅ Best practices

* **Write custom GraphQL queries**

  * Auto-generated GraphQL queries are often unoptimized and may contain nested objects with redundant data. For example, a recipe might include an ingredients object, which in turn references the same recipe again. Creating custom queries can reduce the size of objects and improve performance
