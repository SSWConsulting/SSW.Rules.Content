This error is likely caused by SharePoint trying to render available page layouts for the page to switch to, but there is an error.
A very quick fix that can be applied by a site owner is:

1. Site Settings | Look and Feel | Page layouts and site templates
2. Restrict the valid number of page layouts that can be used, instead of allowing "Pages in this site can use any layout"![](/uploads/rules/do-you-know-this-quick-fix-for-sharepoint-javascript-errors-that-prevents-you-from-switching-page-layout/RestrictedPageLayout.jpg) **Figure: Restrict valid page layouts**
3. This fixes the Ribbon menu

4. Tell your sys admin that there are broken packages in SharePoint and must be fixed ASAP
