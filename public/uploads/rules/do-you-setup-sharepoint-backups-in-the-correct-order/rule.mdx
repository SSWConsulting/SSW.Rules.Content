DPM is great for backing up SharePoint data, but when you select to back up the SharePoint role of a server, DPM will only backup the SharePoint_Config database and the content databases, which is less than ideal.

<endOfIntro />

To back up the SharePoint Server properly in DPM:

1. Create a new Protection Group, for our example we will call it **SharePoint Protection**
2. In the new Protection Group, add protection for the for the SharePoint role on your SharePoint server:

  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  captionStyle="default"
  caption={"Notice that SharePoint protection only selects the SharePoint_Config and Content databases"}
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-setup-sharepoint-backups-in-the-correct-order/dpm-spcorrectorder-1.png"
/>


3. Now browse to the SQL Server and add the entire SharePoint SQL Instance to the **SharePoint Protection** group. You will notice that you are unable to select some of the databases, as they are already being protected by SharePoint role protection.


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  captionStyle="default"
  caption={"Ensure you back up the remaining databases in the SharePoint SQL Instance"}
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-setup-sharepoint-backups-in-the-correct-order/dpm-spcorrectorder-2.png"
/>


After following these steps you will have full protection of your SharePoint databases.
