Many of us now have a desk job, which involves (if you don’t have a stand-up desk) a whole lot of sitting around. Couple this with an inactive lifestyle outside of work and you have a recipe for poor body and mental health.

If you are unable to get to the gym there is still plenty of exercises that can be done with no equipment at all. Bodyweight exercises, or calisthenics, offer a convenient and effective way to enhance strength, flexibility and overall fitness without reliance on memberships or equipment.

The [Australian Department of Health recommends for people aged 18-64](https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/health-pubhlth-strateg-phys-act-guidelines#npa1864):

- 2.5-5 hours of moderate per week
  or
- 1.5-2.5 hours of vigorous exercise per week
