seoDescription: Enhance user convenience by adding a "Logout" shortcut next to the
  username, making it easy to log off with one click.
title: Authentication - Do you have a 'Logout' short cut next to the username ?
type: rule
uri: authentication-do-you-have-a-logout-short-cut-next-to-the-user-name

Although most of the sites have a 'Log off' submenu, we recommend adding a short cut next to the username, this will make the 'log Off' operation more convenient.
