After the database has finished being attached to the web application you will get a log file with information about the import process.

1. Open up this log fine and pay special attention to any lines with **[ERROR]** .

   Note #1: The most common reason for errors is that you have forgotten to activate a feature.

   Note #2: If you have your own custom solutions, show this file to your developers to ensure it isnâ€™t your custom solution causing the errors.

2. Check your Application Event log after migration for errors related to your SharePoint Web Application, and fix these accordingly.
