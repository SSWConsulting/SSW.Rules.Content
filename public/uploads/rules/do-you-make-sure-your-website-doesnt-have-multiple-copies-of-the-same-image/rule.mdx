Image files are outside the realm of most database developers mind sets. So I've seen many very messy websites that have duplicate images all over the place. You only need an image in one place in your website. The rule is that if it is used once, it goes in the associated directory - e.g. /ssw/Company/Images OR if it is used more than once, the image is moved to the root images directory - e.g. /ssw/Images. One of benefits of avoiding duplicate images is speed up web surfing for your users.
