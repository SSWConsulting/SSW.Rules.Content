If you're only posting to your Instagram feed, you're missing a powerful opportunity to connect with your most engaged audience. Instagram Stories sit right at the top of the app and are one of the first things people tap, making them perfect for time-sensitive updates, casual behind-the-scenes content, or quick tips.

Unlike Reels or grid posts, Stories disappear after 24 hours. But that doesn’t mean your content has to! Use Story Highlights to pin the best ones to your profile and make sure key content (like product demos or event recaps) is always available to visitors.

To get the most out of Instagram Stories:

* Post Stories daily to stay top of mind and maintain consistency.
* Use interactive stickers (polls, quizzes, questions) to boost engagement.
* Tag relevant people, locations, and hashtags to expand your reach.
* Add a link sticker to drive traffic — available to all accounts, not just those with 10k+ followers.
* Save valuable content in Story Highlights with clear labels like "Events", "Tips", or "Tools".

💡Tip: Use templates to keep your Stories visually on-brand, and check your Instagram Insights to see what’s resonating. Don’t just post and forget; measure and improve.
