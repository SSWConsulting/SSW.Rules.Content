It's go time - teams have been allocated and the day has arrived.

**Tip:** This agenda can change depending on how many people are attending. E.g. If you have fewer people attending, you could start presentations earlier.

Ensure this is sent out to all staff months before the event to encourage ideas.

    ## Hi All

I’m really excited about our Brainstorming Day! I hope you’re all thinking about what you would like to work on.

To prepare for our Brainstorming Day, send Adam, Matt W, William, Piers, and Brady something that you would like to work on as a group.
E.g. Our awesome SophieBot project came out of the Melbourne Brainstorming session a few years ago.

**Tip:** A Done Video can help explain and sell your idea to other attendees ⭐

See video on: [https://ssw.com.au/rules/use-the-brains-of-your-company](/use-the-brains-of-your-company)

**Note:** We will try our best to adhere to this agenda, but the event may run overtime. If this happens dinner will be provided! 🍕
**Tip:** If you have a time-sensitive commitment after work, let the Brainstorming planners know in advance so they can prioritse your presentation

**Agenda** (copied from [https://ssw.com.au/rules/brainstorming-agenda](/brainstorming-agenda))

* **8:00 am** - 🤝 Meet at the Brainstorming venue - we will have breakfast ready and order coffee
* **8:05 am** – 🙋 Introduction - a run-through of the day and a summary of the retro
* **9:00 am** - 🧑‍💻 Start working on your project
* **12:30 pm** - ✨ Finish polishing presentation - have done a run-through, have decided who presents
* **1:00 pm** – 🍴 Lunch
* **2:00 pm** - 🧪 Do Test Please then a [tech check](/tech-check) with the TV team (The recording is more important than the live audience, working with mics is also great practice for when you are on-site with a client)
* **3:30 pm** - 🎤 Start presentations (Tip: Start presentations earlier/later depending on how many people are attending). You should have someone doing the timekeeping and ring a bell to help keep them on track. For example:

  * 7 mins - one soft bell 🛎️
  * 8 mins - two soft bell 🛎️🛎️
  * 9 mins - 3 soft bells 🛎️🛎️🛎️
  * 10 mins - 4 soft bells and then another one each 30 sec 🛎️🛎️🛎️🛎️

* **6:00 pm** – 🍻 The pub!
