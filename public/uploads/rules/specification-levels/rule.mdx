There are 5 levels/types of Specifications:

### 1. I have an idea

Run from this
or
Verify they have a really hefty bank account!

### 2. High-Level Requirements Document

This will read like a wish list with no details and many unanswered questions. High-Level requirements are very vague and open to many interpretations.

### 3. Detailed Requirements Document

The details have been fleshed out and allow developers to write Functional and Technical Specifications.

* We need a login page for northwind.com
* Must match existing site look and feel
* Username is already in the Users table in the ABC database (SQL Server)
* Password should be at least 8 characters
* .NET is already used for the existing site so that is what this should use of course

  }}

/>

### 4. Functional Specification

This will include detailed mock-ups for the UI, use cases/user stories and might be at a level to allow for fixed price quoting on the project. Functional Specifications go into more detail about the user interface and interactions in the system.

* We need a login page for northwind.com
* Must match existing site look and feel
* Users table must be defined and added to the ABC database (SQL Server 2008)
* **Username consists of user first initial and first 7 characters of the last name**
  * **For example Joe Jones -&gt; jjones**
* Password should be at least 8 characters
* Site uses .NET 4 and this interface must be added to existing project
* This is the layout for the login interface
* **A red asterisk (\*) should be displayed if a value is left blank and Submit is pressed**

### 5. Technical Specification

This is the blueprint for the application. There should be no unanswered questions and should allow for a fixed-price quote.

* We need a login page for northwind.com
* Must match existing site look and feel
* Users table must be defined and added to the ABC database (SQL Server 2008)
* Username consists of user first initial and first 7 characters of the last name
  * For example Joe Jones -&gt; jjones
* Password should be at least 8 characters
* Site uses .NET 4 and this interface must be added to existing project
* Define the data model explicitly
  ![](/uploads/rules/specification-levels/Table.jpg)
* Must work with IE7, IE8, IE9, and FF3
* Must display correctly at 1024x768 resolution
* Must support ANSI characters for Username and Password
* Will not support mobile browsers
* Will not be tested with localization (assumes en-us local on US versions of software)
* SQL Membership provider will be leveraged
