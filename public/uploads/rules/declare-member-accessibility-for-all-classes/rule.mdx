Not explicitly specifying the access type for members of a structure or class can be misleading for other developers. The default member accessibility level for classes and structs in Visual C# .NET is always private. In Visual Basic .NET, the default for classes is private, but for structs is public.

<endOfIntro />

```csharp
Match MatchExpression(string input, string pattern)
```
**❌ Figure: Bad - Method without member accessibility declared**  

```csharp
private Match MatchExpression(string input, string pattern)
```
**✅ Figure: Good - Method with member accessibility declared**
