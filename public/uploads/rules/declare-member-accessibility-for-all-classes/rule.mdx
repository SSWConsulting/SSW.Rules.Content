  body={<>
Not explicitly specifying the access type for members of a structure or class can be misleading for other developers. The default member accessibility level for classes and structs in Visual C# .NET is always private. In Visual Basic .NET, the default for classes is private, but for structs is public.

We have a program called [SSW Code Auditor](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/Rules.aspx#Interoper) to check for this rule.
