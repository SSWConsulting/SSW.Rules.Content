When following a template for sending an email, sometimes you will make a major deviation that is important to callout for the receivers.

In that case, highlight the text so that it is obvious there is a deviation.

Hi Sophie,

This email was completed a week later than normal because I didn't have a phone when she started work.

Done - my voice message is "Hi, you've reached Jane Northwind from SSW. I don't use voice mail, so please send an SMS. Thanks!"
