Depending on how much visibility you need on ongoing costs, you will have to decide whether to use 1 or 2 week development iterations.

A 1-week Sprint is for small projects (less than 2 months) or if constant visibility into costs is an important factor, as it gives better feedback to the Product Owner.

A 2-week Sprint is the most common and allows a reasonable amount of work to be done for each release, while minimising Project Management overheads.

A 4-week Sprint is a smell.

It is important to note that as more project management overheads are added, these will have to be paid for.

It's important to find the right balance for you.

### Internal Projects

For internal software development projects, since there is less cost involved in project management overhead, 1 week Sprints are recommended.

If there has been less than 5 man-days of effort during the Sprint, however, (e.g. due to leave or interruptions), keep adding 1 week to the Sprint until you have at least 5 man days of effort worked.
