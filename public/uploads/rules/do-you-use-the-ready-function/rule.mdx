Putting your initialization JavaScript code inside the `.ready()` function is not always required, but it's much safer to do so.

<endIntro />

jQuery exposes a [.ready() event](https://api.jquery.com/ready) which fires when the Document Object Model (DOM) is fully loaded and ready to be manipulated.

You can attach a function to this event so you can be sure the page is ready for you to work on.

```js
$("#login").addClass("hidden");
```
**❌ Figure: Bad example - If this jQuery is in the wrong place, the #login element may not exist!**  

```js
$(function () {
  $("#login").addClass("hidden");
});
```
**✅ Figure: Good example - This code won't run until the DOM is fully loaded**
