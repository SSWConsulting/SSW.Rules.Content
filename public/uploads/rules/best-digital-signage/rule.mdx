Digital signage is the practice of showing up-to-date content on screens - TVs in reception areas, meeting rooms, kitchens, and corridors - so key information is visible without anyone needing to ask. It’s typically used for:

* Company news and announcements
* KPIs and operational dashboards
* Welcome and wayfinding (e.g. visitors / room info)
* Rosters, events, safety messages, and office reminders

A modern signage platform should be easy to manage, secure, and usable beyond TVs (e.g. embedded into SharePoint/Teams), so the same content can reach people whether they’re walking past a screen or browsing the intranet.

## ❌ The Pain

If signage relies on USB sticks, PowerPoint exports, or someone manually “keeping a browser open”, it usually leads to:

* Stale content (updates become a chore)
* Manual sign-ins and broken sessions
* Security risk (credentials on devices / shared accounts)
* Screens drifting out of sync across locations

A proper signage solution keeps everything centralized, repeatable, and consistent.

## ✅ [ScreenCloud](https://screencloud.com/)

ScreenCloud is a strong “single platform” option for digital signage across physical screens and intranet surfaces (SharePoint/Teams), especially when content is web-based (Power BI, portals, internal pages).

The most useful ScreenCloud features:

### [Dashboards](https://screencloud.com/learn/screencloud-dashboards-guide) (including MFA)

Use Dashboards to display authenticated web apps reliably, including scenarios where MFA is required. It allows you to go to a webpage and record steps to open the exact dashboard you need.

Use this when:

* A dashboard requires login (including MFA)
* You need stable “always-on” authenticated displays
* You need to show a page that ScreenCloud does not support by default (e.g. PowerBI is supported by default)

### [Page Scroll](https://screencloud.com/apps/pagescroll) (for long pages)

Use Page Scroll to show a webpage and automatically scroll it at a set speed - perfect for long internal pages, wiki content, news feeds, and status pages.

Use this when:

* You want to display an internal page without redesigning it for TV
* The content is already great - it just needs to scroll
* You want “zero-maintenance” signage that stays current

### [Power BI](https://screencloud.com/dashboards/powerbi)

Use the Power BI integration/app to display dashboards cleanly and securely on screens.

Use this when:

* You’re sharing KPIs and performance metrics broadly
* You want a supported, consistent Power BI experience on signage

### [Embeddable Channels](https://help.screencloud.com/en/articles/10115771-using-embeddable-channels-with-screencloud) (SharePoint / Teams)

Use Embeddable Channels to publish signage content into SharePoint pages (and Teams-connected SharePoint sites). This lets the same channel power both TVs and the intranet - one source of truth.

Use this when:

* You want signage content visible to people not near a TV
* You want a “signage hub” page on your intranet
* You want consistent messaging across physical and digital spaces
