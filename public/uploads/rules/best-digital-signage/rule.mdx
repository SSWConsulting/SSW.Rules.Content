Digital signage is the practice of showing up-to-date content on screens—TVs in reception areas, meeting rooms, kitchens, and corridors—so key information is visible without anyone needing to ask. It’s typically used for:

* Company news and announcements
* KPIs and operational dashboards
* Welcome and wayfinding (e.g. visitors / room info)
* Rosters, events, safety messages, and office reminders

A modern signage platform should be easy to manage, secure, and usable beyond TVs (e.g. embedded into SharePoint/Teams), so the same content can reach people whether they’re walking past a screen or browsing the intranet.

## ❌ The Pain

If signage relies on USB sticks, PowerPoint exports, or someone manually “keeping a browser open”, it usually leads to:

* Stale content (updates become a chore)
* Manual sign-ins and broken sessions
* Security risk (credentials on devices / shared accounts)
* Screens drifting out of sync across locations

A proper signage solution keeps everything centralized, repeatable, and consistent.
