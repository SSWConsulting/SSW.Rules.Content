seoDescription: Make publicly available discussions that benefit from transparency
  and community involvement. (Note - I've kept it concise, included primary keywords,
  and matched the description with user intent. Let me know if this meets your requirements!)

As long as there is nothing confidential or NDA in the content, any discussion point should be made public. Transparency is the name of the game. The more transparency you have between customers, management, and your technical employees the better. This fosters trust and a closer working relationship.

So keep jewels from being left in your inbox. Remember that you are inviting replies, and that the gold in this process.

**Note:** If the discussion is not worth a blog post, then tweet it and link to the rule.
