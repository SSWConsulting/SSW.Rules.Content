Providing the duration of a video helps set clear expectations for viewers, allowing them to gauge how long it will take to watch and improving overall engagement. Consistently using a standardized format for hours, minutes, and seconds ensures clarity, making it easy for audiences to quickly understand and trust the presented information.

The following table shows the right format for writing video time lengths (hours, minutes, seconds) on the web.

<endIntro />

| Duration | Correct format | ❌ Bad examples | ✅ Good examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| Less than 1 minute | &#123;&#123;x&#125;&#125; sec | 30s / 30secs / 30 secs | 30 sec |
| 1 to 59 minutes | &#123;&#123;x&#125;&#125; min | 25m / 25mins / 25 mins | 25 min |
| 1 hour | &#123;&#123;x&#125;&#125; hr | 60 mins / 1 hour / 1h 00m | 1 hr |
| More than 1 hour | &#123;&#123;x&#125;&#125; hr &#123;&#123;x&#125;&#125; min | 3h 05m / 3h5min / 3h 5m 10s / 3 hrs 5 mins | 3 hr 5 min |

**Notes:**

* "1 h" is also accepted, but we prefer "1 hr"
* You should ignore seconds for anything longer than 1 minute
* Although "mins" is a commonly used abbreviation for minutes, you should be aware that it is not correct for scientific use.
