Teams Meeting chats are **only** visible to people who were invited to the meeting. If someone joins late or isn’t invited, they won’t see the previous conversation.

If others need to be part of the discussion or you want to continue the conversation after the meeting ends, **create a group chat instead**.
  </>}
/>
Use **group chats** - instead of meeting chats - when you want to:

* Allow anyone you choose to see the chat (including the full message history), regardless of meeting attendance
* Make [reaction polls](/easy-questions/#ask-for-reactions-for-multiple-options), where you may want to gather extra opinions or continue the discussion later
* Stay accessible in the chats list on the left side of Teams app

    **Tip:** Start a group chat **before** the meeting and paste the meeting link inside. That way, everyone stays on the same page and the conversation continues seamlessly.
