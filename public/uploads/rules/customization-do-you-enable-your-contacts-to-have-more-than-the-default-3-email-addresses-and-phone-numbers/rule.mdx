seoDescription: Enabling contacts to have more than the default 3 email addresses
  and phone numbers with CRM4 customization.
title: Customization - Do you enable your contacts to have more than the default 3
  email addresses and phone numbers?

Out of the box CRM4 only enables a contact to have 3 phone numbers (home, business and mobile) + 3 email addresses (but only one visible). A customization that almost everyone needs is to remove this limitation (to allow contacts to have an unlimited amount of phone numbers and email addresses).

There are a few customizations needed to get the SSW Contact Makeover:

- Show some hidden fields
- Make some form changes to move to a new tab
- Make a CRM frame (to add in a subform)
- Add some entities
- Add some form java script to hide the core Contact Details? tab when a user is
  entering a new contact
