It can be difficult to get everybody into a meeting, especially these days when many meetings are online. It is important that time is not wasted in these situations, so it's good to be proactive and have a plan for when the decision maker is busy.
  </>}
/>
### Make it a ceremony

You have already [shared the agenda](/share-the-agenda), so pick out the best item and ping the decision maker on teams before the meeting:

> "We're meeting in 30 minutes, I'm excited to be talking about xxx"

### Be persistent

  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    If the meeting has started and someone is missing, then add them to the call. Ping them if they dont answer.
If a decision maker is missing from the call and you don't get a response, tell them _"I will call you towards the end of the meeting for a summary"_, as per [Do you know how to loop someone in at the end of a meeting?](/loop-someone-in)
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

Once you have done the above, you can start the meeting without the decision-maker. You may choose to start with the less important items in the agenda, or the ones that won't require a final decision ("For information" items) that can be easily summarised at the end of the meeting.

### I’m here, where is everyone else?

If you join a meeting and the other attendees haven't joined yet, use the ”Request to Join” button in teams.

Teams | Participants | Request to Join

This will remind the team that the meeting has started just in case they missed the calendar reminder.
