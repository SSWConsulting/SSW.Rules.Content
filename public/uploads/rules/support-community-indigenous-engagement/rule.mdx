Supporting community and indigenous engagement initiatives is vital for fostering strong relationships with the communities in which we operate. By actively engaging with and supporting local, indigenous, small to medium-sized, and regional businesses, we can promote economic development and sustainability.

### Key Principles for Community and Indigenous Engagement

To effectively support community and indigenous engagement initiatives, businesses should focus on the following principles:

#### Employing Locally

* **Local Employment:** Prioritize hiring workers with the necessary skills from the host communities where your business operates. This not only provides employment opportunities but also strengthens community ties.
* **Indigenous Employment:** Create specific programs and opportunities aimed at increasing indigenous employment within your business.

#### Procuring Locally

* **Local Procurement:** Whenever possible, source goods and services from local suppliers, especially small to medium-sized businesses and regional businesses. This supports local economies and reduces environmental impact.
* **Indigenous Suppliers:** Support indigenous-owned businesses by incorporating them into your supply chain wherever possible. This can involve direct procurement or partnerships with larger suppliers to include indigenous businesses.

#### Community Engagement

* **Initiatives and Programs:** Where ever appropriate actively participate in and support community and indigenous engagement initiatives. This can include sponsoring local events, participating in community programs, and collaborating with local organizations.
* **Feedback and Consultation:** Regularly seek feedback from community members and indigenous groups to understand their needs and how your business can better support them.

### Practical Implementation Tips

To put these principles into practice, consider the following tips:

* **Partnerships:** Form partnerships with local organizations, indigenous groups, and business chambers to identify opportunities for engagement and support.
* **Training Programs:** Develop training programs to enhance the skills of local and indigenous workers, preparing them for employment within your business.
* **Mentorship and Support:** Provide mentorship and support to local and indigenous businesses, helping them grow and succeed.
* **Transparent Reporting:** Maintain transparency in your community engagement efforts by reporting on your initiatives and their impacts regularly.
