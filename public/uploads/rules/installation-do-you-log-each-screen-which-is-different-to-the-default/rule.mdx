It is impossible to exactly remember every configuration setting in an MSCRM install. A historical log of the installation is hugely valuable when there are problems after installation is completed and helps to correctly re-install if required. The easiest and most convenient way of doing this is to take screen captures of every screen and paste them into a Word document. E.g. \_InstallSteps_CRM2011.docx

You will also need this because you are going to do this in a Dev, then Test and then Production environment aren't you :-)
