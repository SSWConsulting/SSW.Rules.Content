When reviewing another developer's pull request, review comments can fall into a mix of categories. Some changes might be required, while others might be optional. Do you know the best way to tell the requester which is which?
  </>}
/>
## Types of Pull Request Feedback

When reviewing pull requests, comments can often be divided into two categories:

* **Change** - you must change this if you want me to approve
* **Consider** – consider this suggestion, but don’t feel obliged to change (i.e. I would do this, but I won’t block you on it)
* **PBI** – Important, but create a PBI to fix this in future

By prefixing the comment with one of the categories above, the reviewer can make it clear to the author if they must make the change or not.

When adding 'PBI' comments, a "good Samaritan" approach is to create the PBI and link to it (add a [TODO task](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/todo-tasks/)). Alternatively if you just leave the comment and want the requester to do it, they should do the same (add a TODO with a link to the PBI) before you approve it.
