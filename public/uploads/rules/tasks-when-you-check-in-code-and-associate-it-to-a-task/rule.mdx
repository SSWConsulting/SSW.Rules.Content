seoDescription: In Scrum, associate code changes with tasks rather than PBIs to track
  work done during a Sprint and provide full traceability.
title: Tasks - Do you know when to check in code and associate it to a task?

In Scrum you work only on tasks in a Sprint, and the task must belong to a committed PBI. As such, when you commit code in Azure DevOps (was TFS), you should associate it with the task you are working on rather than the PBI.

<endOfIntro />

The reason behind this is that doing so provides a better way to track change sets in a Sprint and give full traceability for work done during the Sprint.
