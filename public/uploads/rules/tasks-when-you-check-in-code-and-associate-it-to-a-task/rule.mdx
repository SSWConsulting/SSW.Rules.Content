<introEmbed
  body={<>
In Scrum you work only on tasks in a Sprint, and the task must belong to a committed PBI. As such, when you commit code in Azure DevOps (was TFS), you should associate it with the task you are working on rather than the PBI.
  </>}
/>
The reason behind this is that doing so provides a better way to track change sets in a Sprint and give full traceability for work done during the Sprint.
