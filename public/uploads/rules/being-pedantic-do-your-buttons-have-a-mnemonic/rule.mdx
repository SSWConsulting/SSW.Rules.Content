A mnemonic for a button is the letter which has an underscore, and the user can press the button using `Alt-<char>`.

  alt="Image"

  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: 'Bad example - All buttons without Mnemonic',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}

  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: 'Good example - All buttons with Mnemonic - user can easily choose which button they want without a click',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}

In Windows Applications, it is quite easy to assign a mnemonic to a button with the "&" character.

So for the case above, the text would be:

```cs
btnAbout.Text = "&About"
```
