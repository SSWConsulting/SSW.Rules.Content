People may not pay attention to some important words in your interface. Adding a simple and clear icon beside the words will make the difference.

For emails and web content, using an simple emoji is an easy and friendly way to achieve the same result 🙂.

#### Using icons

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure="Bad example - No icons to indicate the status"
  src="/uploads/rules/enforce-the-text-meaning-with-icons-and-emojis/validation-bad.jpg"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Good example - Green tick and red cross help the user to know what's going on"
  src="/uploads/rules/enforce-the-text-meaning-with-icons-and-emojis/validation-good.jpg"
/>


#### Using emojis


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    I join a lot of Sprint Reviews, and there is a consistent problem I see among Scrum teams. The PBIs have limited or missing information. Usually, this is due to unclear requirements...
  </>}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure="Bad example - No emojis to enforce the meaning"
/>

  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Good example - The emoji gives extra focus on what is important"
