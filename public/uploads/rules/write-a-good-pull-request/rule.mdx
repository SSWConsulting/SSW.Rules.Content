As a software developer, you are going to create Pull Requests (PRs) that you want to be easy for others to review and approve. The quality of a Pull Request can vary - from cryptic to well-written.

Including a little bit of context helps your reviewer understand changes quickly so they can review your PR faster and give better suggestions.

There are 2 essential things you should have when writing a Pull Request:
  </>}
/>
## 1. Concise and self-explanatory **title**

Good **PR titles** provide a clear, concise summary of the change, helping reviewers quickly understand its purpose and priority.

* What the PR will do
* How the PR achieves it
* Emojis! Follow the [GitMoji.dev](https://gitmoji.dev) standard

The key to writing a concise Pull Request is to base the PR itself on a PBI / Issue (assuming they are well written).

<asideEmbed

  body={<>
    **PBI title:** Product Backlog Item 100359: "Desktop App | Exporting occasionally failed"

**Pull Request title:** Fix exporting
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Bad example - Pull Request title does not tell what issues have been fixed and how",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    **PBI title:** Product Backlog Item 100359: "Desktop App | Exporting occasionally failed"

**Pull Request title:** üêõ BUG - Fix desktop app exporting - prevent database concurrent access while exporting
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "Good example - Pull Request title briefly describes the fix that it has",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


Having the **"What"** information allows the reviewers to quickly understand what this is about while having the **"How"** can help the reviewer to quickly understand how your PR solved the problem. Sometimes we might want to put the **"How"** in the PR descriptions (see below) if it is too long or hard to explain in one sentence.

## 2. Clear and informative **description**

The Pull Request description is a medium for the developer to tell the reviewers what the changes are about.

Good **PR descriptions** provide context to help others quickly understand the problem, solution, and rationale. This minimizes confusion, accelerates reviews, and improves overall code quality.

<asideEmbed
  variant="info"
  body={<>
    **Tip:** For rare straight-forward changes, the self-explanatory title might be enough. You should still make sure there is enough details so the reviewer knows what initiated the changes. E.g. "**PR Title:** Fixed broken LinkedIn link caught by CodeAuditor on footer"
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

Examples of sentences to have in a good PR description:

* "Relates to **#&#123;&#123; ISSUE NUMBER or URL &#125;&#125;**" (‚ö†Ô∏è see [avoid linking to Issues you do **not** want to close](/avoid-auto-closing-issues/))
* "From email subject: **&#123;&#123; EMAIL SUBJECT &#125;&#125;**" (similar to the rule on [warn then call](/warn-then-call))
* "As per my conversation with **&#123;&#123; NAME(S) &#125;&#125;**" (similar to "[as per our conversation](/as-per-our-conversation-emails)" rule)
* "Worked with **&#123;&#123; @MENTION(S) &#125;&#125;**" (as per [pair or mob programming](/do-you-use-co-creation-patterns) rule)
* "This PR is to **&#123;&#123; ACHIEVE THE FEATURE / FIX THE BUG / OTHER GOAL(S) &#125;&#125;**" (anything that was not possible to explain in the title)
* "See **&#123;&#123; SCREENSHOT / DONE VIDEO &#125;&#125;** for more details" (to help the reviewer to understand the changes. E.g. styling changes)

If you noticed that a change needed to be made and had no specific task/issue, use:

* "I/We noticed a problem: **&#123;&#123; DETAILS &#125;&#125;**"

If there is an area you are uncertain about, add:

* "I'm looking for feedback on this code"

If the PR is closing an email task after merged, remember to refer back to it:

* "Done - see email: **&#123;&#123; EMAIL SUBJECT &#125;&#125;**"

#### FAQs

**Q: Are you making many small changes?**
**A:** You should summarize by saying: *‚ÄúImproved readability‚Äù* OR *‚ÄúFixed typos and grammar‚Äù*.

**Q: Are the changes big and complex?**
**A:** You should include a demonstration of the change.
E.g. A [screenshot](/screenshots-avoid-walls-of-text) to show text/UI changes, or a [Done video](/record-a-quick-and-dirty-done-video) to demo functionality changes.

**Q: Are you using a CMS editor (i.e. Netlify or [Tina](https://tina.io))**
**A:** CMS editors may automatically add a placeholder description. If you're using a CMS to make your changes, you may need to go to the PR afterward and update the description to include the context.
