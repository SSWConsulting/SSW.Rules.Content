❌ **Bad way:** Use the Global Address List in Active Directory, because you can’t update it from Outlook... Only an administrator can maintain the details.

**Note:** Good UI as it is easy to find inside Outlook.

✅ **Good way:** Use the Dynamics 365 (formerly CRM 2016) toolbar.

**Note:** We have a suggestion that Outlook should allow you to put the CRM URL into Tools | Options so this is better integrated.
