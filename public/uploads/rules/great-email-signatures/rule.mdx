Email signatures are a great way of adding some advertising and branding. You should **always use a nice email signature for external emails**. Internally, you may use a short one (just your name or initials).

<endOfIntro />

Full email signatures (for external recipients) are great when they have:

* A little **branding** and advertising (can be a tagline or company news), so people know instantly who it is from

  * You can **promote services or awards** at the bottom (e.g. "⭐️ [2023 Microsoft Partner of the Year Finalist](https://www.ssw.com.au/SSW/Consulting/Case-Study/Shepherd-Centre.aspx)")
* Your **phone number** (in international format - it's important to add the country code so people from all around the world can easily add you to their contacts - as per [the right format to show phone numbers](/do-you-know-the-right-format-to-show-your-phone-number))
* Your company **website** link
* Your **social media** and **blog** link
* Your **IM** link (e.g. [Teams](https://www.msoutlook.info/question/teams-chat-link-in-email-signature) or [Facebook Messenger](https://medium.com/@michael_at_message/getting-a-facebook-messenger-link-and-messenger-code-dc27ee70a172))
* Your **position**
* Your **location** (city/country) where you are based

    **Note:** You [can't add hyperlinks to signatures if you are using the Outlook App](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/all/add-hyperlink-to-outlook-signature-on-iphone-and/56edcf68-a1ba-43c1-80cc-49b3248b25e8) – what a shame.

## Mobile Signature

Use the **mobile signature** when sending emails from your phone. Mobile signatures are not easily customized so they can be simpler.

  figurePreset="badExampleExample"

  body={<>
    Thanks, Adam\

  </>}
  figurePreset="goodExampleExample"
  figureText={"Good example – Custom signature with name, URL, phone number, and IM link"}
/>


## PC Long Signature (Big and Fancy)

Use the complete **long signature** when sending a new email or appointment to a client.

This is created in HTML and goes well on emails with Word used as the email editor. Include some product advertising, like what's new on your monthly newsletter. It should have the company colors.

  figureText={"A great long signature for PC"}
  src="/uploads/rules/great-email-signatures/adam-long-signature.jpg"
/>


However, you shouldn't use your long signature on **every** sent email. It's recommended to have a simpler version for internal emails and appointments:

## PC Short Signature

Use a really **short signature** (your first name or initials) or no signature at all in internal emails as people already know who you are. You may want to add a quick link to IM.

    **Note:** "Ping me on Teams" is a link that directly opens chat with the person as per [Teams Hyperlinks on Outlook Signature

## Implementation

### Option 1: CodeTwo (paid)

The easiest way to implement consistent signatures across a company is to use a 3rd party signature provider e.g. CodeTwo.com and Exclaimer.com\
This way you quickly get great email signatures, with consistent branding, to all your employees and on all their devices. CodeTwo is cheaper and has a nicer design tool UI than Exclaimer, however they are both good. CodeTwo is built on Microsoft technology.

CodeTwo (and Exclaimer) give:

* Automatic signatures are added on any device – from laptop to smartphones
* Consistent signatures for every employee as they all use one template – [consistency is important](/do-you-understand-the-value-of-consistency)
* Management via a portal
* Marketing can run campaigns and schedule changes to all signatures
* Hassle-free setup – users do not need to touch any signatures on any devices

  body={<>
    **Note:** The plugin currently does **not work for Appointments** due to a limitation in Outlook. Rules must be manually changed in Exchange Online to include appointments in the server-side version of CodeTwo. Once this has been configured do not manually copy your signature into an appointment or you will get 2 signatures.
