Microsoft Dynamics Marketing has four different user types. You can see a breakdown of the difference below:

| User Type    | Added to O365? | License Required? | Administrator capability? | Description                                                                               |
| ------------ | -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Regular User | Yes            | Yes               | Yes                       | Most commonly used type. Possible to grant all active role types, excluding media buying. |
| Media Buyer  | Yes            | Yes               | Yes                       | All active roles a regular user has plus expanded media buying and planning roles.        |
| Web Portal   | Yes            | No                | No                        |

| Restricted access. Intended largely to provide “View” access to specific functionalities contractors, vendors, and clients. Some edit capabilities. |
| Public | No | No | No | Selected functions globally available publicly, such as Public Libraries and Landing Pages. |

**Note:** Since there is a Web Portal type, allowing viewing of the majority of the app, only 1 or 2 Regular or Media Buyer licences need to be bought for any small to medium business, as only kep people will actually be using the majority of the functionality.
