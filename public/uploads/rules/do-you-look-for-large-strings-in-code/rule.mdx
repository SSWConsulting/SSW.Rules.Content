Long hard-coded strings in a codebase can be a sign of poor architecture.

<endIntro />

To make hard-coded strings easier to find, [consider highlighting them in your IDE](/do-you-highlight-strings-in-your-code-editor).

Figure: Bad Example - The connection string is hard-coded and isn't easy to see in the IDE.![](/uploads/rules/do-you-look-for-large-strings-in-code/longstringbadexample2.png)Figure: Better Example - The connection string is still hard-coded, but at least it's very visible to the developers.![longstringgood.png](/uploads/rules/do-you-look-for-large-strings-in-code/ShortStrings.png)Figure: Good Example - The connection string is now stored in configuration and we don't have a long hard-coded string in the code.
