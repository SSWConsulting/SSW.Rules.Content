Making CSS changes can range from straightforward tweaks to complex adjustments that impact multiple elements or pages. Knowing when to handle changes yourself and when to seek a developer's input can save time and reduce risks.

## When to make CSS changes yourself

For small or simple adjustments, it’s often faster and more efficient to handle the change yourself. This applies when:

* **The change is isolated**: Adjustments affect only a specific element or page
* **Minimal complexity**: Minor visual changes, such as color or spacing tweaks
* **No significant dependencies**: No impact on other components or functionalities
* **Low testing requirements**: The changes don’t need to be tested across multiple browsers or devices
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "```css\n.button {\n  font-size: 1rem;\n}\n```\nFigure: Good example – A simple CSS change handled without involving a developer",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />

    Making the changes yourself still require someone else to check your work (e.g. [over the shoulder](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/over-the-shoulder/))
  </>}

    preset: "default",
    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

## When to involve a front-end developer

More extensive or unfamiliar CSS changes require careful handling to avoid unintended side effects. In these cases, seeking help from a developer is advisable:

- **Scope**: The change spans multiple pages or templates
- **Complexity**: It involves restructuring layouts or adding new functionality
- **Dependencies**: Modifying elements tied to JavaScript or backend code
- **Testing requirements**: Requires thorough cross-browser testing
- **High impact**: Changes that affect core UI components or interactions
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "```css\n/* Original CSS: Grid-based dashboard layout */\n.dashboard-container {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: 1fr 3fr;\n  grid-gap: 20px;\n  height: 100vh;\n}\n\n.sidebar {\n  background-color: #2d2d2d;\n  color: white;\n  padding: 20px;\n}\n\n.main-content {\n  background-color: #f5f5f5;\n  overflow: auto;\n  padding: 30px;\n}\n\n/* Attempted Complex Change: Altering layout to flex without checking dependencies */\n.dashboard-container {\n  display: flex; /* Switch from grid to flex */\n  flex-direction: column;\n}\n\n.sidebar {\n  width: 100%; /* Full width sidebar */\n  height: 50px; /* Introduced height constraint */\n}\n\n.main-content {\n  flex: 1; /* Fill remaining space */\n  overflow: visible; /* Removing critical overflow control */\n}\n```\nFigure: Bad example – A complex layout change attempted without consulting a developer, risking broken functionality",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />



## Key Factors
When determining whether to proceed independently or engage a developer, consider:

- **Scope** – How many components/pages will be affected?
- **Complexity** – Are structural elements or media queries involved?
- **Impact** – Will the change affect other functionalities?
- **Familiarity** – Do you understand the CSS framework or codebase?
- **Time** – How much time will it take?
- **Testing** – Does the change need cross-browser/device testing?
- **Dependencies** – Will this change break other components?
- **Stakeholders** – Do significant changes require input from designers or project managers?

By evaluating these factors, you can balance efficiency with caution, ensuring smooth updates without compromising quality. When in doubt, consulting a front-end developer who is familiar with the project is always the best approach.
