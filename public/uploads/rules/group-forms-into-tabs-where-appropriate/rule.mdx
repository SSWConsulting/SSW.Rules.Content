Having a separate form for every block of data that needs to be entered can become a confusing and tedious process. A common example is having one form to add/edit Contact details, another to add/edit that Contact's Address details, and a third to add/edit that contact's Qualifications. This is not user-friendly...

The best and most organized way to do this is by using tabs - see the [examples](/use-clean-designs-when-creating-forms).
