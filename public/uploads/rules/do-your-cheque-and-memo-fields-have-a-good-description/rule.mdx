It is always a good idea to provide more details when submitting an expense claim or recording an invoice. This helps to ensure clarity and avoid any confusion in the future.
E.g. The period the invoice relates to.

Make sure to include the following details as much as possible:

- The purpose: Clearly state what was for.
- Relevant project or client information: This helps with tracking and allocation.
- Authorization details: If it requires approval from someone, mention who authorize it.
- Supporting documentation: Attach any necessary documents that validate it.
