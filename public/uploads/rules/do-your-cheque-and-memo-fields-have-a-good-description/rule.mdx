E.g. The period the invoice relates to.

Make sure to include the following details as much as possible:

- The purpose: Clearly state what was for.
- Relevant project or client information: This helps with tracking and allocation.
- Authorization details: If it requires approval from someone, mention who authorize it.
- Supporting documentation: Attach any necessary documents that validate it.
