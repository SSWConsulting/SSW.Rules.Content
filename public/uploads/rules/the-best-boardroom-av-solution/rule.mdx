There are several ways you can set up your boardroom AV for effective and efficient conferencing. The **best and recommended solution today is Microsoft Teams Rooms with a Logitech setup**.

<endIntro />

## Microsoft Teams Rooms (Recommended)

The easiest and most reliable way to run hybrid meetings is to use a **Teams-certified Logitech bundle**.\
This includes the camera, microphones, speakers, and a Teams Room console – all purpose-built for different room sizes (Huddle, Medium, or Boardroom).

**❌ Cons:**

* Tied to Microsoft Teams (limited if your company standardises on other platforms)

## Apple TV

A popular way to connect devices wirelessly to the boardroom TV is to use an Apple TV.

## Smart TV’s with built-in AirPlay, Google Cast and Miracast

A newer way to connect wirelessly is to use Smart TV’s built-in features.
