### Apple TV

A popular way to connect devices wirelessly to the boardroom TV is to use an Apple TV.

- It allows you to connect any Apple device including iOS.
- Easy to use for Apple users
- Can be easily added to an AV automation system, e.g. Control4, Savant, etc. which allows you to display on any other display connected to the same AV system
- Inexpensive way of adding wireless connectivity to an existing system

} } />


- Only works with Apple devices
- Not designed for corporate networking (can’t have both guest access and secured network at the same time)
- Guest need to be on a corporate network to connect

### Smart TV’s with built-in AirPlay, Google and HoMirrorcast

A newer way to connect wirelessly is to use Smart TV’s built-in features.

- Not designed for corporate networking (can’t have both guest access and secured network at the same time)
- Guest need to be on a corporate network to connect
- Display cannot be shared across multiple screens in an automated AV setup, e.g through Control4

### Extron

For a more robust AV solution, you can install an Extron system. We recommend the ShareLink Pro.

- Also has an HDMI through connection so you can connect both wired and wirelessly
- IT-friendly with monitoring tools and dual networking options, allowing for guests to connect without hassle
- Can integrate as part of an AV automation system, e.g. Control4 or even Extron’s own
- Extron support and reliability is highly rated

- You **need** to install an app, users can’t just connect and display something wirelessly without it
- Expensive

### Barco Clickshare

A more advanced wireless solution, Barco Clickshare allows you to use any laptop device without installing software by connecting a small USB dongle. The Clickshare 'brain' is connected to your TV or AV hub via HDMI.

} } />


- Compared to a wired HDMI signal, the video will not play super smoothly all the time (bad if you’re playing back videos for review)
- Can easily lose the dongles if staff and guests are not careful
- Most expensive option (can be around 8K AUD for the 4k version)
