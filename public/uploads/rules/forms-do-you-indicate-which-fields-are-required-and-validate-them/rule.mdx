seoDescription: Indicate required fields and validate them to avoid user frustration
  and ensure data conformity to business requirements.
title: Forms - Do you indicate which fields are required and validate them?
type: rule
uri: forms-do-you-indicate-which-fields-are-required-and-validate-them
---

Always indicate which fields are required. Users get frustrated when they experience a wasted trip to the server, just because they did not get an obvious indication of what was required first time around.

<endIntro />

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure={"Bad example - No visual indication for required fields when a user first sees the form"}
  src="/uploads/rules/forms-do-you-indicate-which-fields-are-required-and-validate-them/Required-field_Bad-example.jpg"
/>


A designer will know the best way to indicate required field depending on the layout. However if you are in doubt and don’t have a designer around, a red asterisk is definitely the best option.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure={"Good Example - A visual indication of what fields are required (use a red asterisk if you are not a designer)"}
  src="/uploads/rules/forms-do-you-indicate-which-fields-are-required-and-validate-them/Redstar_Good-example.jpg"

### More information on ASP.NET implementation

You should combine these visual indicators with appropriate client and server side validators to make sure that your data conforms to business requirements. Adding a RequiredFieldValidator to the above textboxes gives you data validity check with minimal coding.

```cshtml
<asp:Textbox runat="Server" ID="email" />
```
**❌ Figure: Bad example - No validator used, so the user won't know the email is required**  

```cshtml
<asp:Textbox runat="Server" ID="email"/>

<asp:RequiredFieldValidator runat="Server" ControlToValidate="email" ErrorMessage="Please enter an email address"

ID="emailReqValidator" />
```
**✅ Figure: Good example - An ASP.NET validator in use, to indicate the fields required**

  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    **Note:** For ASP.NET Dynamic Data although validation is done differently (under the covers it is using a field template + the ASP.NET validator).
