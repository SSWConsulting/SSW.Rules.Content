  body={<>
In Clean Architecture, it is normally better to have a unique Data Transfer Object (DTO) for each endpoint or use case.

While sharing DTOs across multiple endpoints might seem like a way to save some code, it often leads to several problems:

* **Unnecessary Data Transfer:** Endpoints sending more data than what is actually needed, this can lead to performance issues.
* **Increased Coupling:** When multiple endpoints share the same DTO, a change required by one endpoint can inadvertently affect others.
* **Developer Confusion:** Developers will find it hard to understand which properties are relevant for a specific endpoint, leading to potential misuse or misunderstanding of the data structure.

/>
By creating unique DTOs tailored to each endpoint's specific requirements, you ensure that:

* Endpoints only deal with the data they need.
* Performance is optimized by avoiding the transfer of superfluous data.
* Endpoints are decoupled, making them easier to develop, test, and maintain independently.

namespace Northwind.Trading.Application.Contracts.Models;

public class OrderItemModel
{
    public int OrderId { get; set; }
    public string CustomerId { get; set; }
    public DateTime OrderDate { get; set; }
    public decimal TotalAmount { get; set; }
    public OrderStatus Status { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Used for GetOrderListEndpoint. Ignore when updating
    /// </summary>
    public string? ShipFromCountry { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Used only for GetOrdersEndpoint.
    /// </summary>
    public DateTimeOffset ModifiedDateUtc { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Detailed list of order items. Only for GetOrderDetails.
    /// Not used for GetOrderList
    /// </summary>
    public List<OrderItemViewModel> OrderItems { get; set; } = [];
}
```
