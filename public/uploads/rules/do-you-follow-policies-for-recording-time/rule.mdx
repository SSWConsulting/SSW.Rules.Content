There needs to be consistency between all of your developers' timesheets, so you should get them all to adhere to the following:

<endIntro />

* Be accurate

/>


* [Describe the work you have done?](/do-you-know-how-to-describe-the-work-you-have-done-while-avoiding-the-word-bug)
* Record all the work you do for a client, even if it is to be written off
* If you are working with another employee, ensure your times are consistent, in both time and category
* If you are providing telephone support, count your time in 15 minute blocks
* If you work for a client 4 times in a day for 15 minutes each, feel free to enter one timesheet for 1 hour, listing the 4 things you did. The extra information adds no value and only serves to clutter up invoices
