Explaining problems can be really hard. Often, when you are trying to talk with someone about them, they get lost and frustrated because they don't fully understand the context.

That's why it is crucial to start at a fully zoomed out level and slowly zoom in with your audience.

<endIntro />


<youtubeEmbed url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tKRozsNl_0c" description={"Video: Do you explain a problem by zooming in and out with Luke Cook (5 min)"} />


When trying to explain something, think about it in the context of 3 levels of zoom:

* Macro Zoom - Context
* Normal Zoom - Challenge
* Micro Zoom - Core


<boxEmbed
  style="info"
  body={<>
    **Tip:** Use [ZoomIt](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/zoomit?WT.mc_id=DOP-MVP-33518) for easy recording and on screen notation, especially when using [YakShaver](https://yakshaver.ai).
  </>}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure={""}
/>


Each level provides a little bit more context so that the listener can understand the next level down and eventually reach the core question.

/>


## Scenario - Problems interacting with the database for a new view

Let's take a look at an example of how these levels are applied practically.

A developer has recently been asked to build a new table view. The view will show information about the work that consultants have done on client projects. The developer has run into a roadblock because they aren't really sure how best to get the data from the database. Specifically, they aren't sure what query to run or how to structure the classes in the code.

What they shouldn't do is jump straight into the meat of the problem by saying something like:


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    How should I structure a class for a table?
  </>}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure={"Bad example - The listener has no idea what screen or problem is being talked about"}
/>


### Macro Zoom - Context

Explain the context first to give a big picture view of what’s being discussed.


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    I am working on a table view in TimePro, which needs to display information about how many hours our consultants worked on each client project.
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure={"Good example 1/3 - Now a baseline for what we are talking about has been established"}
/>


### Normal Zoom - Challenge

Next, zoom in a little to talk about your challenge with this task (why you’re having this conversation in the first place).


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    The challenge I’m facing is finding a suitable way of getting the relevant data, because of the flexibility between which clients are selected and which consultants may be present.
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure={"Good example 2/3 - This sentence helps the listener understand the specific difficulties being faced"}
/>


### Micro Zoom - Core

Now that the audience knows what you’re trying to achieve and the challenges, you can delve deep into the core question itself.


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    I’m not sure how best to query the database efficiently, or how I should be structuring the DTO in a way that doesn’t duplicate information unnecessarily
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure={"Good example 3/3 - A baseline context and the challenge have been established, so the listener can understand the original question"}
/>

You might be thinking this example is very specific to software developers... but you can really do it in any kind of role.

Here are some other examples:

## Scenario - Editing a video

Let's look at an example for a TV crew member.

They are editing a video about zooming in and out. However, there is a problem because they have noticed that the wrong microphone was used, meaning the sound quality is bad. Now, they want to know if they need to re-record or if the stakeholder is happy with the audio as is.

What they shouldn't do is jump in with the question about re-recording straight away.


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    Should I re-record this video?
  </>}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure={"Bad example - The context and challenge haven't been explained yet, making it confusing"}
/>


Instead they need to slowly zoom in by explaining the context, then the challenge, then the core question.


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    I'm editing the video on zooming in and out.

I've run into an issue because I've noticed it was recorded with the wrong microphone.

I think the audio is good enough, are you happy for me to run with it or do you want me to re-record?
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure={"Good example - The context was explained, then the challenge, then the core question"}
/>


## Scenario - Ordering a pinball machine

Let's take a look at an example for an admin.

They have been asked to procure a pinball machine for the office. They've run into a roadblock because the model that they were asked to get is out of stock everywhere. Now, they want to find out if they should wait 2 months for stock to come back or order another one they found online.

So, they should make sure they don't jump in with the first question about ordering a different model.


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    Should I order this other pinball machine?
  </>}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure={"Bad example - The context and challenge haven't been explained yet, making it confusing"}
/>



<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    I'm ordering that pinball machine we talked about.

Unfortunately, it's out of stock everywhere and won't be back in stock for 2 months.

Should I order this other pinball machine instead?
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure={"Good example - The context was explained, then the challenge, then the core question"}
/>


## The outcome

If you apply these techniques, your conversations are going to be:

* More efficient
* Happier
* Stress-free
