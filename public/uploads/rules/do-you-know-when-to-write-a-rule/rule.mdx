The purpose of a rule is to effectively establish and record a process to guide employees in their day to day activities.
  </>}
/>
Rules facilitate:

- Consistency
- Coherent instruction
- A high standard of documentation
- Better understanding of processes
- Efficiency improvements

Only write a rule after the situation has happened more than once – chances are it will happen again and a rule/standard should be created.
