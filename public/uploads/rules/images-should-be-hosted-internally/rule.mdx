When want to show an image from the web on your website, the easiest way is to just copy the image's path and add it. This is not a good idea as the original host of the image can delete it, which will cause a broken image in your website.
  </>}
/>
The right way to do this is to copy the image locally and upload to your own server, so you have total control over the image.

```html
<img
  src="https://some-external-url.com/images/open-extension.png"
  alt="Open extension"
/>
<dd>Figure: Open extension</dd>
```
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Figure: Bad example - Using an external URL as image source. The image can be edited or deleted and there is nothing you can do about it",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


```html
<img src="https://ssw.com.au/images/open-extension.png" alt="Open extension" />
<dd>Figure: Open extension</dd>
```
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "Figure: Good example - Image is hosted internally. You have control over the image",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


**Note:** For copyrighted images, you should **always** mention the source.
