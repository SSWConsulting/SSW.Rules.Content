Zendesk is being used everywhere now, and it is good! To ensure you are receiving important internal tickets, you need to whitelist your Zendesk domain in your primary email server.

<endIntro />

If you are using Exchange, you can do this by doing the following:

1. Go to your Exchange Admin Center
2. Mail Flow | + icon | Bypass spam filtering:


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure={"Bypass spam filtering setting in Exchange"}
  src="/uploads/rules/ensure-zendesk-is-not-marked-as-spam/bypass-spam-filtering.png"
/>


3. On the new window that opens, type a good name for the rule | Apply this rule if... | domain is | type your Zendesk domain (in our case, ssw.zendesk.com):


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure={"Adding domain to bypass list"}
  src="/uploads/rules/ensure-zendesk-is-not-marked-as-spam/adding-domain-to-bypass-list.png"
/>


4. The rest should already be correctly configured, hit Save

Done! You now allow any Zendesk emails through your server correctly. No more missing important tickets!"
