Keep in mind that while you can change your display name, you may not be able—or want—to rename your actual account. That’s why it’s best to use your **full name**. If you go by just "Peter," others may have trouble telling you apart from the three other Peters they know.

**Tip:** If you travel around, people often will ask you _"Where are you?"_. You can avoid this by putting the square brackets where you currently are. E.g. [SSW Brisbane] or [Cisco Melbourne].
