List Views such as in [SSW Diagnostics](https://ssw.com.au/ssw/Diagnostics/) can present a wealth of information to the user. But too often, users are unable to copy this information to paste into a support email because the list view doesn't support copying. Instead, the user has to frustratingly retype the information with the risk of introducing errors.

Make it easier for the user by enabling the "MultiSelection" property of a ListView and providing a right click menu with a "Copy" item that copies to the clipboard.
