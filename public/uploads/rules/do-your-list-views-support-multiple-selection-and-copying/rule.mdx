List Views such as in [SSW Diagnostics](https://ssw.com.au/ssw/Diagnostics/) can present a wealth of information to the user. But too often, users are unable to copy this information to paste into a support email because the list view doesn't support copying. Instead, the user has to frustratingly retype the information with the risk of introducing errors.

<endOfIntro />

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  captionStyle="badExample"
  caption={"Bad example - List view with only single selection and no copying"}
  src="/uploads/rules/do-your-list-views-support-multiple-selection-and-copying/listview_bad.png"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  captionStyle="goodExample"
  caption={"Good example - List view with multiple selection and copying"}
  src="/uploads/rules/do-your-list-views-support-multiple-selection-and-copying/listview_good.png"
/>


Make it easier for the user by enabling the "MultiSelection" property of a ListView and providing a right click menu with a "Copy" item that copies to the clipboard.
