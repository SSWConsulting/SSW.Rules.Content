You will need to ensure that you have the rights to use these featured images. A few options include:

<endOfIntro />

1. Purchasing a subscription to a stock image site
2. Using a royalty-free stock image site. E.g. [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/) or [pxhere.com](https://pxhere.com/)
3. Using Google Images that are labeled for reuse:


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePreset="default"
  figureText={"Finding Images Labelled for Reuse within Google Images"}
  src="/uploads/rules/where-to-find-images/google-image-labeled-reuse.jpg"
/>


4. Use [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) to create a featured image with overlaid text

5. Taking your own photos

Ensuring you are not breaching copyright will save you from any trouble in the future.
