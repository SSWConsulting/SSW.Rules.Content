There are a lot of different CRM solutions on the market.Â We would never suggest to develop a CRM solution from scratch. Instead pick an existing solution and customize it for your needs.

<!--endintro-->

The main choices for CRM solutions are:

- [Salesforce](http://www.salesforce.com/crm/ "Salesforce")
- [Microsoft CRM](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/MicrosoftCRM.aspx "Microsoft CRM ")

At SSW we implemented a lot of CRM services based on Microsoft CRM. The experience with this solution showed us high trust in using Microsoft CRM as a base for future business needs.

Read the [rules to better Microsoft CRM](/rules-to-better-crm-for-users) to get an idea what CRM can do for you.
