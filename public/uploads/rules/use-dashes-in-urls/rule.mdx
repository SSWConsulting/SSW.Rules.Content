    **More info:** You can install the IIS [URL Rewrite Module](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/extensions/url-rewrite-module/using-the-url-rewrite-module?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-33518) for IIS7 you can make ugly URLs much more friendly.

![Figure: Rewrite both the HTML in the page and the incoming URL's to be friendly](/uploads/rules/use-dashes-in-urls/friendly-url-rule.jpg)

The caveat here is that it will only work if the URL is in the clear on the page.

**Note:** This could only be done with certain links as others are postbacks as well.
