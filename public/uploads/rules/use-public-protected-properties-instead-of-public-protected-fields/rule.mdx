<introEmbed
  body={<>
Public/Protected properties have a number of advantages over public/protected fields:

- **Data validation**
  Data validation can be performed in the get/set accessors of a public property. This is especially important when working with the Visual Studio .NET Designer.
- **Increased flexibility**
  Properties conceal the data storage mechanism from the user, resulting in less broken code when the class is upgraded. Properties are a recommended object-oriented practice for this reason.
- **Compatibility with data binding**
  You can only bind to a public property, not a field.
- **Minimal performance overhead**
  The performance overhead for public properties is trivial. In some situations, public fields can actually have inferior performance to public properties.

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{

```cs
public int Count
{
 get
 {
 return _count;
 }
 set
 {
 _count = value;
 }
}
```

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: 'Figure: Good code - Variable declared as a Property',
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


We agree that the syntax is tedious and think [Microsoft should improve this](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/BetterSoftwareSuggestions/VisualStudio.aspx#PropertyShortcut).
