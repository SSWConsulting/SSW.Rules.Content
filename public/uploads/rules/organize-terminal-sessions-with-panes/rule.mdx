Windows Terminal is a modern terminal application that allows users to manage multiple command-line tools from a single interface. One standout feature is the ability to split the main window into multiple panes, enabling the running and viewing of multiple sessions side by side within a single window.

This feature serves as an alternative to having multiple terminal windows open simultaneously. Panes help keep everything in one place, making it simpler to navigate between different sessions.
