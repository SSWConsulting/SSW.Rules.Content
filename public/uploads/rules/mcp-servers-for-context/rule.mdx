AI coding assistants are incredibly powerful, but they're limited by the context they can access. Instead of relying on proprietary, single-platform extensions, you should instead use **Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers** to connect your AI tools to external data sources in a standardized, portable way.

<endIntro />

### What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard introduced by Anthropic in November 2024 that defines how AI systems integrate with external data sources and tools. With MCP, you build a server once, and it works for any MCP-compatible client - from Claude Desktop, to Cursor, Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot, and many others.

#### Key Benefits

* Open Standard - Not locked into any single vendor
* Build once, use everywhere - One MCP server works across all compatible AI cleints
* Standardized authentication - OAuth 2.0 support for secure connections
* Two-way communication - AI can both read data and perform actions

### MCP vs Proprietary Extensions

MCPs hold a number of advantages over proprietary extensions, such as:

* Portability - Proprietary extensions only work on individual platforms, whereas MCP servers work across all MCP clients.
* Maintenance - With proprietary extensions, they need to be rebuilt for each platform they're available for, whereas with MCP servers, they only need to be built once and can be deployed everywhere.

### Recommended MCP Servers

* [GitHub MCP](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server) - Allows AI tools to directly connect to GitHub's platform, giving them the ability to read repositories and code files, manage issues and PRs, analyze code, and automate workflows.
* [Brave Search MCP](https://github.com/brave/brave-search-mcp-server) - An integration to the Brave Search API, providing comprehensive search capabilities, including web search, local business search, video search, news search, and AI-powered summarization.
* [Filesystem MCP](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem) - Allows AI models to interact with a local or remote computer's file system, enabling it to read and write files, manage directories, search and organize files and retrieve metadata.
* [Aspire MCP](https://aspire.dev/dashboard/mcp-server/) - Integrates Aspite into your development AI eco-system, allowing it to query resources, debug with real-time console logs, investigate development time telemetry, and execute resource commands.
* [Playwright MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) - Enables AI tools to interact with web browsers through structured accessibility snapshots, allowing them to navigate pages, interact with elements, fill forms, and execute browser automation without requiring screenshots or vision models.

### Configuring MCP Servers

MCP servers are configured via JSON configuration files, with the location of them depending on your chosen client, for example, for Claude Desktop:

Location:

* macOS: \~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude\_desktop\_config.json
* Windows: %APPDATA%\Claude\claude\_desktop\_config.json
