AI coding assistants are incredibly powerful, but they're limited by the context they can access. Instead of relying on proprietary, single-platform extensions, you should instead use **Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers** to connect your AI tools to external data sources in a standardized, portable way.

<endIntro />

### What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard introduced by Anthropic in November 2024 that defines how AI systems integrate with external data sources and tools. With MCP, you build a server once, and it works for any MCP-compatible client - from Claude Desktop, to Cursor, Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot, and many others.

#### Key Benefits

* Open Standard - Not locked into any single vendor
* Build once, use everywhere - One MCP server works across all compatible AI cleints
* Standardized authentication - OAuth 2.0 support for secure connections
* Two-way communication - AI can both read data and perform actions

### MCP vs Proprietary Extensions
