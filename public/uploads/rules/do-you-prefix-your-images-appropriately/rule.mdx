seoDescription: Optimize your images by using descriptive names and prefixes like
  "ban" for banners, "ico" for icons, or "Screen" for screenshots to improve search
  engine visibility.

It is important to sensibly name your images. We don't use "img" (in the same way we don't use "tbl" for tables).

However, for special types of images we do include a prefix.

| **Image Type** | **Prefix** | **Example**                     |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| Banner         | ban        | banSSW.gif                      |
| Icon           | ico        | icoSSW.ico                      |
| Screenshot     | Screen     | ScreenCodeAuditorMainWindow.gif |
