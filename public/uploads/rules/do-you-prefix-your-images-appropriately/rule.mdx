seoDescription: Optimize your images by using descriptive names and prefixes like
  "ban" for banners, "ico" for icons, or "Screen" for screenshots to improve search
  engine visibility.
title: Do you prefix your images appropriately?
type: rule
uri: do-you-prefix-your-images-appropriately
---

It is important to sensibly name your images. We don't use "img" (in the same way we don't use "tbl" for tables).

However, for special types of images we do include a prefix.
