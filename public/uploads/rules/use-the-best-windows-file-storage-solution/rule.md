Windows has a built-in storage solution called **Storage Spaces** that allows you to group 3 or more storage drives to create a bigger pool; however, that technology, whilst useful, has some better third-party contenders like **Drive Bender**, which does the same thing better and faster.

<!--endintro-->

With **Drive Bender**, you also have software RAID, disk grouping, and file duplication that you find in Storage Spaces, but with a better interface and faster transfer rates.

### Drive Bender Pros

1. Nice UI with lots of functionality
2. Regular updates
3. Heaps of configuration options
4. Friendly (and fast!) customer support (Bonus: They are located in Sydney, Australia, just like SSW! ðŸ˜ƒ)
5. Easy add and remove of drives to the pool
6. Check your disk health automatically
7. Get notifications on pool status

### Drive Bender Cons

1. Storage Spaces is "free" (built-in in Windows Server), Drive Bender is $54.95 for 3 machines (still cheap, forever)

Have a look at [Drive Bender website](https://www.division-m.com/drivebender/) for more info!
