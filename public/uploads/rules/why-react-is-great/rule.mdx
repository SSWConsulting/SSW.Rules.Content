## ✅ Benefits of React

### 1. Simplicity

ReactJS is just simpler to grasp right away. The component-based approach, well-defined lifecycle, and use of just plain JavaScript make React very simple to learn, build a professional web (and mobile applications), and support it. React uses a special syntax called JSX which allows you to mix HTML with JavaScript. This is not a requirement; Developers can still write in plain JavaScript but JSX is much easier to use.

### 2. Easy to learn

Anyone with a basic previous knowledge in programming can easily understand React while Angular and Ember are referred to as *Domain specific Language*, implying that it is difficult to learn them. For React you just need basic knowledge of CSS and HTML.

### 3. Native Approach

React can be used to create mobile applications (React Native). And React is a diehard fan of reusability, meaning extensive code reusability is supported. So at the same time we can make IOS, Android and Web applications.

### 4. Data Binding

React uses one-way data binding and an application architecture called Flux controls the flow of data to components through one control point – the dispatcher. It's easier to debug self-contained components of large ReactJS apps.

### 5. Performance

React does not offer any concept of a built-in container for dependency. You can use Browserify, RequireJS, EcmaScript 6 modules which we can use via Babel, ReactJS-di to inject dependencies automatically.

### 6. Testability

ReactJS applications are super easy to test. React views can be treated as functions of the state, so we can manipulate state we pass to the ReactJS view and take a look at the output and triggered actions, events, functions, etc.

### 7. Great Developer Tools

Developer toolset is another important factor when you are choosing a development platform. There are 2 great tools you should be aware of: **React Developer Tools** and **Redux Developer Tools.** Both can be installed as Chrome extensions.
