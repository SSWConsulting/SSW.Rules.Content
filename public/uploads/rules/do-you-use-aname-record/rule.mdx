ANAME record (also known as A record) is an alias record that allows you to map the apex record or any other record within your domain to a target host name, essentially a CNAME record for the apex record.

The ANAME record is especially useful for when you have multiple domain names and your website is hosted by a provider that changes it's IP Address, this does happen quite regularly with WPEngine. Many DNS service providers do not support ANAME record, however, [DNSMadeEasy](http://dnsmadeeasy.com/) has made this service available.

Configuring ANAME is as easy as configuring CNAME.

Let's have a look at DNS records for **adamcogan.com.au**, DNS records contains apex record for **adamcogan.com.au** and **www.adamcogan.com.au**. The apex record uses ANAME, while CNAME for **www.adamcogan.au** - now we will never have to worry about updating these records, they will follow the DNS records of **adamcogan.com** .
