Developers should add a version number at the end of the out package. E.g. SSWCodeAuditor\_==v14.0.0==.exe

Here is how you do it in Advanced Installer:

<endOfIntro />

1. In the navigation pane look for
   **Media**
2. Choose
   **Configuration** tab and click in
   **MSI name** text box which is located under
   **Output** section
3. Next to the text add
   [|ProductVersion]. If the text-box is empty you may want to start it with
   [|ProductName]
