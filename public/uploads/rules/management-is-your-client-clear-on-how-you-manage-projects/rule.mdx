There must always be **\*one\*** person who is responsible for the project getting into production. That person is the technical lead.

SSW's Rules to Better Project Management, built on Scrum, allows businesses to address their most important challenges first, and respond quickly to a changing commercial environment. Whether you work on site or remotely, the key is good communication with the customer and users, becoming an integrated part of your team.
