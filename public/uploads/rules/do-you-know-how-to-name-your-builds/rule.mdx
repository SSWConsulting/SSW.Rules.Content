You should always follow a naming standard when naming your builds. This helps you identify their purpose at a glance.
  </>}
/>
The build name should have the following suffixes, depending on their purpose:

- **.CI** - For continuous integration builds. These are triggered automatically and do not deploy anywhere.
- **.CD.[Environment]** - For continuous delivery builds. These are triggered automatically and deploy to an environment. You should specify which environment it deploys to as well.
