When working with Continuous Integration (CI) workflows like a GitHub Action or Azure DevOps Pipline, a poorly named file can lead to confusion and slow down the development process. Imagine having to dig into the code to understand what a workflow does every time you encounter it. It's like trying to read a book without a title or chapter names!

A well-named workflow file can save time and reduce confusion. By following a clear naming convention that reflects the purpose and sequence of the workflow, you can understand what's happening at a glance.

Naming your workflows in a way that reflects their purpose and sequence will improve developers experience. Stick to a clear and descriptive naming convention, and you'll never have to guess what a workflow does again.

<endOfIntro />


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    ssw-rulesgpt-prod.yml
  </>}
  captionStyle="badExample"
  caption={"Bad Example - It's unclear what the workflow does, the name doesn't reflect the sequence of actions."}
/>



<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    main-build-deploy.yml
  </>}
  captionStyle="goodExample"
  caption={"Bad Example - It's clear that changes to the main branch cause a build and deploy."}
/>


It's easy to understand, even for someone new to the project.

Steps to naming a workflow:

1. Start with the trigger: What triggers the workflow? (e.g., main, pr)
2. Describe the main action: What's the primary task? (e.g., build, lint)
3. Include additional details: Any secondary actions or specific details? (e.g., and-deploy, infra-check)

Use this template to determine &#123;&#123;TRIGGER&#125;&#125;-&#123;&#123;ACTIONS&#125;&#125;-&#123;&#123;ADDITIONAL DETAILS&#125;&#125;.yml
