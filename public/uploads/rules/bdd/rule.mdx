<introEmbed
  body={<>
In the old days, reading and understanding test cases was something only developers could do. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) starts to solve this problem by enabling organizations to define their use cases in plain language and integrate these aspects with testing frameworks.
  </>}
/>
Using [Gherkin syntax](https://specflow.org/learn/gherkin) and a BDD framework like [SpecFlow](https://specflow.org) you can write test scenarios in plain language using a few key words (Given, When, Then). Plain language makes the test scenarios easy to understand, even for non-technical team members.

First think about the different scenarios that you want to test, then write them out in plain language using gherkin syntax.


<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    **Feature**: Greeting Message
Participant sees a greeting message

**Scenario**: Participant sees a greeting message
Given I visit the website
When I navigate to the greeting screen
Then I see the greeting message
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good example - Gherkin syntax scenarios (Given, When, Then)",
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
/>


Once you have your scenarios lined up, you should begin to write the test steps for each scenario.

```cs
[Given(@"I visit the website")]
public async Task VisitTheWebsite()
{
    await HomePage.NavigateAsync();
}

[When(@"I navigate to the greeting screen")]
public async Task NavigateToWelcome()
{
    await HomePage.NavigateToGreeting();
}


[Then(@"I see the greeting message")]
public async Task ThenISeeTheGreetingMessage()
{
    var message = await HomePage.GetGreetingMessage();
    Assert.IsTrue(message == GreetingMessage);
}
```
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "Figure: Good example - Test steps to run, matching the Gherkin Syntax",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />
