Use a consistent format when writing addresses.

The structure should follow: **Number, Street Name, City, State (abbreviation) Postal Code, Country**

* Beware of the commas positioning (inexisting between **State** and **Postal Code**)
* Don't use dashes, slashes, or bars to separate the elements (OK if it is in the **Street Name** part)
* **Country** is not always necessary depending on the audience
* If you have enough space, it is OK to write it in 2 lines
* We're in Australia and this should work for most countries' addresses, but some specific locations might have different address structures that won't allow following this rule
