Often there are two email threads that have separate tasks in them, but that both relate to a very similar topic. In this case, it can be useful to give them the same subject, with a number afterwards to differentiate them.

Example:


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    SSW Rules - Add 'please update this rule' button ==#1==
  </>}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure=""
/>



<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    SSW Rules - Add 'please update this rule' button ==#2==
  </>}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure=""
/>
