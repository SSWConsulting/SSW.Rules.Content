<introEmbed
  body={<>
Often there are two email threads that have separate tasks in them, but that both relate to a very similar topic. In this case, it can be useful to give them the same subject, with a number afterwards to differentiate them.

Example:


<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    SSW Rules - Add 'please update this rule' button ==#1==
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>



<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    SSW Rules - Add 'please update this rule' button ==#2==
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>
