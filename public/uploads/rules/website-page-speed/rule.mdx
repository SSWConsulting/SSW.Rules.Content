Page speed remains a critical element for the online user experience. The demand for instant information has made faster loading times more crucial than ever.

Users are less patient, and if a webpage takes too long to load, they are likely to abandon it in frustration. This not only results in a lost visitor but also poses a risk to potential conversions.

For a smooth and responsive user experience, your site needs to be checked for performance bottlenecks. These usually become noticeable sometime after deployment, as your user base and quantity of content grows.

This includes checking for improvements on:

* The slowest pages
* The compression of unnecessarily large images
* Slow database queries
* Page responsiveness

## Use the Performance Tab in Chrome DevTools

One of the best ways to identify and fix performance issues is by using the Performance tab in Chrome DevTools.

### This powerful tool helps you

* Record and analyze the page load process
* Identify long-running tasks that block the main thread
* Spot inefficient JavaScript execution
* Visualize layout shifts and rendering bottlenecks

### How to use it

1. Open your website in Google Chrome
2. Right-click anywhere on the page and choose Inspect (or press F12)
3. Navigate to the Performance tab
4. Click Record, then reload the page to capture performance data
5. After recording, you'll see metrics like Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), and other key performance indicators

1. Open your site in Google Chrome
2. Right-click anywhere on the page and choose Inspect (or press F12)
3. Navigate to the Lighthouse tab
4. Choose the report type (e.g., Mobile or Desktop)
