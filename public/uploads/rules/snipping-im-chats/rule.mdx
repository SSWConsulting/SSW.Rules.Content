A manager or client may suggest a course of action or a piece of work that they would like completed in an IM chat. It's highly important that such chats are [converted into an email](/important-chats-should-be-in-an-email). You would copy the messages from the chat screen, paste into an email, then sent to the client or manager with a note: _"As per our IM chat this morning..."_, CC'ing anyone else who is relevant.

However, don't just paste the whole conversation into an email. **Snip the relevant information only.** You can do this by:

1. Deleting junk that is not related to the conversation
2. Deleting repetitive junk that makes it hard to read (like peoples’ names)
3. Adding a line break between people and highlighting the person's name in **bold**
