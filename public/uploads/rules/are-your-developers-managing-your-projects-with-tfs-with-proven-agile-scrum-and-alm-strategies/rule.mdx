Team Foundation Server (TFS) is the fully integrated solution to manage projects, giving developers, testers and management a single source of truth for all project needs.

### Project Managers and stakeholders will love

* TFS's integration with code/SQL/SharePoint which provides a dashboard with project reports, giving them greater visibility of the project status and burn down lists
* The easily customization of the data using Excel Web Services

### Developers will love

* TFS 2010 for the SQL and SharePoint Server Explorer and the integration of viewing, creating and deploying
* That they don't have to try to interpret a bug report from a tester, and then they have to reproduce it. Why? Because of Intellitrace, which allows you to double click and open to the exact line of code with the variables set.
* Seamless source control
* No waiting for compiling and tests to run. The integration with the build server (continuous integration) is the biggest productivity boost you can give a developer
* SharePoint Wiki

### Testers will love

* The many ways of automating their manual tests via:
  * Web tests
  * Performance tests
  * And the jewel in the crown, Coded UI Tests
* The fact they never have to spend time reproducing a bug before documenting it
* And it gets better, they don't have to document it because testing tools recorded what they did
* Later on, when they decide to go with Lab Manager they will never spend time setting up that special environment (say running windows 95 and IE6)
