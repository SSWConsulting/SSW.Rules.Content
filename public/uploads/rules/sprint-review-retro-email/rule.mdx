## Recording a Review and Retrospective Meetings Summary

Creating a comprehensive summary and recording of your Sprint Meeting is a great way to communicate changes in a product to the community and stakeholders — especially for those unable to attend.

<boxEmbed
  style="info"
  body={<>
    **Tip:** The summary should be focused on the Dones and any special highlights. In the email template, bold the most important points so they stand out. These highlighted items should be called out in the summary.
