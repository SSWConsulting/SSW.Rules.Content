When you are asked to improve a feature, your manager expects a recommendation, not a blank question. Don't just throw things over the fence. Even if the request pushes you outside your comfort zone, make a best-effort attempt so the conversation stays focused on approving the right option.

## Give a recommendation, even when you're unsure

* **Timebox your investigation** - Spend a few focused minutes digging into the problem so you can talk about it confidently instead of shrugging your shoulders
* **Use modern helpers** - GPT, Copilot, and other LLMs can draft UI text, suggest color palettes, or list industry-standard statuses even if design is not your specialty

* **Share your reasoning** - Explain why your preferred option fits the product (e.g., aligns with Azure DevOps/GitHub statuses, uses existing colors, or matches product vocabulary)

Once you have a draft, send it for review. Managers love to edit a thoughtful proposal; they hate being asked to start from scratch.

## Show your work

Document the options you explored and where the ideas came from. Being transparent builds trust and makes it easy for others to adjust your proposal.

* Mention the timebox ("I spent 10 minutes exploring...")
* Include any AI prompt or resource you used
* Highlight the pros/cons that led you to your recommendation
