Are you tired of missing important Control4 notifications? Fear not! We have a solution for you. By using the "Incoming Webhook" integration in Slack, you can receive Control4 notifications directly in Slack. üì£üí¨

<!--endintro-->

To set up Control4 notifications in Slack, follow these steps:

1. Open Slack and go to your desired channel or create a new one dedicated to Control4 notifications üì¢
2. Click on the channel name and select "Add apps" from the dropdown menu üîå
3. Search for "Incoming Webhooks" and click on the app to install it
4. Configure the webhook by providing a name for it and selecting the channel where you want the notifications to appear üìù
5. Copy the generated webhook URL. This will be used to send Control4 notifications to Slack

1. In your Control4 system, navigate to the Composer software and open your project
2. Configure the "Generic TCP command" by providing the necessary details, such as the Web address and Post Data

   - **Web Address:** Your Slack Webhook URL e.g. `https://hooks.slack.com/services/Taaqw3H6/B7RMC66yBV/GvA3IEIrpZgy4nqssddsaa`
   - **Post Data:** The message contents (payload) to be delivered to Slack e.g. `{"text":":key:Reception Door Success"}`

3. Save the TCP command settings and test it out by triggering a Control4 event that will execute the TCP command üö®
