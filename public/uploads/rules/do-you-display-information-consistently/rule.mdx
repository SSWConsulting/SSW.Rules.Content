When we want to point users to a page, we simply use the summary part of that page as narrative on the other page. As a result, the user will have a nice flow between pages when navigating around the site.

As an example, the [SSW website](https://ssw.com.au) follows a consistent order: a summary of the product/service and its benefit, followed by a link for more information on that topic.

**Tip:** In this scenario where the summary serves as a teaser for more detailed content, have the link **at the end** of the section, so it's the natural next step for someone who has read it and wants to know more.
