seoDescription: Microsoft TFS users no longer need to type "/tfs" upon login, streamlining
  their experience.
title: Do you remove the need to type “/tfs” ?

Many clients that complain when they type: **tfs.northwind.com**
...and then see ‘Server Error 403 – Forbidden: Access is denied’

It is not a nice experience that in 2015 the out-of-the-box requirement is still to type "/tfs".

So fix the nasty out-of-the-box experience.

  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Option 1 – This is one way. Include some text to tell devs that they can remove the need for /tfs - on the Application Tier page specify port 80 and an empty Virtual Directory",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }

    preset: "default",

  } }
