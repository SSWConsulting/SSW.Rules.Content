<introEmbed

It is difficult for users to find their required records in a huge amount of data, so adding the filter data functionalities is very useful.
  </>}
/>
The standard DataGrid of ASP.NET doesn't include this functionality, developers need to implement it by themselves.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: "Bad Example - implement data filter manually",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-how-to-filter-data/FilterDataInDataGrid.jpg"
/>


Fortunately, RadGrid supplies this perfect feature.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good Example - add an attribute to filter data",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-how-to-filter-data/FilterDataInRadGrid.jpg"
/>


Developer can turn this feature on by setting the AllowFilteringByColumn="True".
