When you are about to finish a client project, it is a good idea to prepare a "thank you" email, have it checked and send it to your customer (usually the Product Owner) on the last day. In this email include:

<endIntro />

1. Make sure you have completed all requirements
2. Thank for the time and tell them the reasons why you enjoyed working on this project
3. Prepare a list of future improvements you can think of that can be done

There are a number of reasons why this is important:

- It shows that you care about your client/project
- Give them something to think about. They might get you back to fix the problems you have identified
- Show that you will be supporting them after the project ends

Below is a template email you can use:

### Email Template

<emailEmbed
  from=""
  to="Bob Northwind"
  cc="\\[Account Manager\\]"
  bcc=""
  subject="\\[Project Name\\] - Thank you"
  shouldDisplayBody={true}
  body={<>
    ## Hi Bob,

Thank you very much for your time for the last xxx weeks. I think you must be the best Product Owner I have worked with at SSW (always available for me when needed). I really enjoyed this project.

I believe I have completed all of your most important requirements. I had good look at the source code and while it's fresh in my mind, I thought I might send you the following suggestions that would make it easier for myself and other developers in future:

Improvement Area 1:

1. Do this: because of this
2. Do this: because of this
