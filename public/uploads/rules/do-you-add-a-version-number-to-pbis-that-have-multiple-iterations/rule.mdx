Sometimes your team will work on a PBI, finish it in the Sprint, and receive feedback about changes or extensions that weren't originally asked for in the [Acceptance Criteria](/do-your-user-stories-include-acceptance-criteria-%28aka-never-assume-automatic-gold-plating%29).

<endIntro />

**Bad Example:** Unlimited new tasks get added to that PBI so it takes multiple Sprints to finish

**Good Example:** A new PBI is added to the backlog called "&lt;original PBI name&gt; v2". If this then happens again, a v3 is created, and so on

This has the added bonus of allowing the [Product Owner](/rules-to-better-product-owners) to see, at a glance, how many rounds of feedback he's given to the team on each PBI.
