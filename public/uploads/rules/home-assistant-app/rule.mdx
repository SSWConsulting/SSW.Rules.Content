Check in on your home or office from your smartphone using the Home Assistant Companion App. It turns your iOS or Android device into a smart home/office command center, giving you quick access to dashboards and controls, plus extra power like phone sensors (battery, network, location) and push notifications that can be used in automations.

#### Installing Home Assistant on your phone

To use the app, you need a Home Assistant server already running (at home or in your office) and a user account to log in with.

1. Download the app from:
   * [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/home-assistant/id1099568401)
   * [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.homeassistant.companion.android)
2. Connect to your Home Assistant server

Open the app and select Connect to my Home Assistant server. If nothing is found (or you are offsite), tap Enter address manually and enter your Home Assistant URL.

If you are on the same WiFi/LAN, the app will usually discover your server automatically.

1. Permissions you’ll be asked for (what to choose)
   * Notifications: enable them so Home Assistant can alert you (automations, reminders, alarms).
   * Location: optional, but useful for presence-based automations and can improve secure-connection options.

#### Using Home Assistant

Once logged in, you will have access to your main dashboard.
