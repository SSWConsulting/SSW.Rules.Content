    **Tip #1:** If you are recording the steps to reproduce a bug, it might be better to use [Chrome Recorder](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/recorder) instead.

    **Tip #2:** Zoom, and Microsoft Teams are cloud-based services, so consider whether an option such as Snagit, Loom or Clipchamp that records locally is more appropriate. **If you record with Zoom, post-production editing will be required**

    **Tip #3:** Sometimes, all you need is a GIF to demonstrate something. For this, you can record one with a tool like [Gifox](https://gifox.app/) (MacOS only).
