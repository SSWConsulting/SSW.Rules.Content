<introEmbed

Whenever you need a number from a system you should think of how you can create a report, so next time you can press a button to get the result.
  </>}
/>
If you found yourself doing ad-hoc reports, or random SQL queries, a few years ago, the best thing to do was to make sure the boss knows you could not find the data you needed, so he could commission a new report to be built.

The best practice is to jump into Power BI and build the report yourself.

    ## Dear boss

Today I needed to find xxx and so I had to write a query to find it. You can find it at \\server\Reports_Adhoc\SalesByRegion.xlsx

I suggest adding this into our Performance Point Cube so I could find it at a URL.
