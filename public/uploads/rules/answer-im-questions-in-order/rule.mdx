seoDescription: Answering IM questions one by one can greatly improve signal to noise
  ratio and make communication more efficient. To do this, simply respond to each
  question separately, repeating its keywords as necessary.
title: Do you answer IM questions in order?
type: rule
uri: answer-im-questions-in-order

Sometimes people fire a few questions at you and the tendency is to answer in all kinds of ways that can make our signal to noise ratio poor.

Tips when answering IMs:

* Answer each question in order

* Repeat the keywords of each question

* Avoid grouping your messages together [as per the rule](/separate-messages)
