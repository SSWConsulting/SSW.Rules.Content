Whenever a long process is churning away (e.g. about 10 seconds) users will usually do something else, either make a coffee or switch to another window.
  </>}
/>
Your application should remind the user to go back and check on it by:

- Playing a sound
- Hiding the progress bar
- Showing a message box at the end of the long process

See rule on [Do you know how to make long-running processes user-friendly?](/long-process-do-you-know-how-to-make-long-running-processes-user-friendly)

When using Message Box to indicate user a process is done, always includes detailed summary of the process. Don't just say "Process completed."

  </>}
  figureEmbed={{

    figure: "Bad example – No detailed information",
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
/>


This is just like standing at a set of traffic lights listening for the beep to know when to walk, rather than constantly looking at the red and green lights.
