One of the best features of RayGun is the ability to track crash reports against deployments. This feature allows you to tell if a particular deployment has introduced a lot of new bugs or caused a regression of exceptions.

To set it up:

<endOfIntro />

1. Under Deployments
2. Select Octopus Deploy (Set up)

 Raygun will product you with a [PowerShell script](https://raygun.com/docs/deployments/octopus-deploy) to add into your octopus deployment steps that will call the RayGun API and log a new deployment 3. Trigger a new deployment 4. Then you’ll see the deployment in RayGun

Drilling into a deployment you’ll see:

- New errors
- Regressions
- Recurring errors
