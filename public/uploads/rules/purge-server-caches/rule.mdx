Extensive caching can complicate things if you’re working on your site and expecting to see changes immediately on the frontend. Purging cache is an essential part of the development process.

<endIntro />

WPEngine - After you make a change on any WordPress site:

- Log in to your website’s wp-admin dashboard
- Click on the WP Engine plugin tab
- Scroll down, click Purge All Caches
