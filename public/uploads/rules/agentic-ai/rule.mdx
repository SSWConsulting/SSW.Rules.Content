AI agents are autonomous entities powered by AI that can perform tasks, make decisions, and collaborate with other agents. Unlike traditional single-prompt LLM interactions, agents act as specialized workers with distinct roles, tools, and objectives.

## Why build agentic systems?

* **Automation** - Handle complex, multi-step workflows autonomously
* **Specialization** - Assign agents to tasks they're optimized for (e.g., research, coding, analysis)
* **Scalability** - Deploy an "army" of agents to tackle large projects
* **Collaboration** - Enable agents to communicate and share insights

## When to choose each framework

When choosing a framework for building agents, you need to be aware of the tradeoff between customisability and ease of use.

For example, n8n is a no-code solution that is only really useful for automating simple workflows, while frameworks like LangGraph offer deeper control but with a steeper learning curve.

The closer you get to the raw LLM API requests, the more customisable you can make it – however, this will often come at the cost of additional development effort.

### Agent Framework ⭐️

Agent Framework shines when:

* Your application requires dynamic conversation flows between multiple agents
* You're creating systems with diverse conversational agents working together
* You value the backing of Microsoft's research division
* You're working on research projects needing flexible agent interactions

### OpenAI Agents SDK

The OpenAI Agents SDK is ideal when:

* You require a straightforward, production-grade framework that's easy to learn
* Your existing stack already includes OpenAI models and you want seamless integration
* You need strong tracing and debugging capabilities built into the framework
* You're building for production environments

### LangGraph

Consider LangGraph when:

* Your project involves intricate, recurring workflows requiring sophisticated state handling
* You're developing systems with multiple interconnected agents
* You have prior experience with the LangChain ecosystem
* You benefit from visualizing your agent workflows graphically
* You need enterprise-grade reliability

### n8n

Choose n8n if:

* You need a no-code solution for building simple agent workflows
* You want a visual, drag-and-drop interface
* You have team members without coding experience who need to participate
* You're creating marketing, sales, or design team prototypes

## Language limitations and considerations

Most of the leading agent frameworks today, including LangGraph and OpenAI Agents SDK, primarily use Python as their development language. 

For C# developers, the most promising path forward is through **Agent Framework**. This framework is a result of a merger between two projects, Semantic Kernel and AutoGen. This integration brings the powerful multi-agent capabilities of AutoGen to the familiar and enterprise-ready .NET ecosystem.
