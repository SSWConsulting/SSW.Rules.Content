  body={<>
AI agents are autonomous entities powered by AI that can perform tasks, make decisions, and collaborate with other agents. Unlike traditional single-prompt LLM interactions, agents act as specialized workers with distinct roles, tools, and objectives.

## Why build agentic systems?

* **Automation** - Handle complex, multi-step workflows autonomously
* **Specialization** - Assign agents to tasks they're optimized for (e.g., research, coding, analysis)
* **Scalability** - Deploy an "army" of agents to tackle large projects
* **Collaboration** - Enable agents to communicate and share insights

## Leading agent frameworks comparison

| Tool / Feature | **Developed by** | **Best for** | **Learning curve** | **Key features** | **Integration** | **Production ready** |
|----------------|------------------|--------------|---------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| [**Autogen ⭐️**](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/) | Microsoft | Multi-agent conversations, flexible agent topologies | Medium | - Conversational agents<br>- Event-driven<br>- Group chat | Python, various LLMs | Research-focused |
| [**OpenAI Agents**](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/) | OpenAI | Production-ready pipelines with OpenAI models | Low | - Agent SDK<br>- Native handoffs<br>- Built-in tracing<br>- Guardrails | Python/JS, OpenAI ecosystem | Yes, built for production |
| [**LangGraph**](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph) | LangChain | Complex stateful workflows, cyclical execution patterns | High | - Graph-based workflows<br>- State management<br>- Human-in-loop<br>- Time-travel debugging | Python/JS, LangChain ecosystem | Yes, enterprise-grade |
| [**n8n**](https://n8n.io/) | n8n | No-code AI workflow automation | Low (visual interface) | - Visual workflow editor<br>- 400+ integrations<br>- AI nodes | No-code interface, LangChain under the hood | Yes, for workflow automation |

**Note:** Microsoft is planning to merge [Semantic Kernel](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/use-semantic-kernel/) and AutoGen into a unified framework, combining enterprise Azure workflows with advanced agent capabilities.

## When to choose each framework

When choosing a framework for building agents, you need to be aware of the tradeoff between customisability and ease of use.

For example, n8n is a no-code solution that is only really useful for automating simple workflows, while frameworks like LangGraph offer deeper control but with a steeper learning curve.

The closer you get to the raw LLM API requests, the more customisable you can make it – however, this will often come at the cost of additional development effort.

### AutoGen ⭐️

AutoGen shines when:

* Your application requires dynamic conversation flows between multiple agents
* You're creating systems with diverse conversational agents working together
* You value the backing of Microsoft's research division
* You're working on research projects needing flexible agent interactions

### OpenAI Agents SDK

The OpenAI Agents SDK is ideal when:

* You require a straightforward, production-grade framework that's easy to learn
* Your existing stack already includes OpenAI models and you want seamless integration
* You need strong tracing and debugging capabilities built into the framework
* You're building for production environments

### LangGraph

Consider LangGraph when:

* Your project involves intricate, recurring workflows requiring sophisticated state handling
* You're developing systems with multiple interconnected agents
* You have prior experience with the LangChain ecosystem
* You benefit from visualizing your agent workflows graphically
* You need enterprise-grade reliability

### n8n

Choose n8n if:

* You need a no-code solution for building simple agent workflows
* You want a visual, drag-and-drop interface
* You have team members without coding experience who need to participate
* You're creating marketing, sales, or design team prototypes

## Language limitations and considerations

Most of the leading agent frameworks today, including AutoGen, LangGraph, and OpenAI Agents SDK, primarily use Python as their development language. This presents a challenge for organizations like SSW that predominantly use .NET and C#.

For C# developers, the most promising path forward is through **Semantic Kernel**. Microsoft is currently working on integrating AutoGen's capabilities into Semantic Kernel, which will allow .NET developers to leverage cutting-edge agent technology using C#. This integration is expected to bring the powerful multi-agent capabilities of AutoGen to the familiar and enterprise-ready .NET ecosystem.

### Our recommendation

While waiting for the full Semantic Kernel integration, we recommend C# developers start experimenting with AutoGen in Python. The knowledge and patterns you learn will transfer directly to Semantic Kernel's implementation once it's complete, as Microsoft is directly incorporating AutoGen's architecture.

```python
# Example AutoGen code that will be portable to Semantic Kernel in future
import autogen

# Define agents
assistant = autogen.AssistantAgent(
    name="Assistant",
    llm_config={"model": "gpt-4o"}
)

user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(
    name="User_Proxy",
    human_input_mode="NEVER"
)

# Start conversation
user_proxy.initiate_chat(
    assistant,
    message="How can I build a simple C# web app with an LLM backend?"
)
```

For a glimpse of how Semantic Kernel is already beginning to integrate with AutoGen, see this example:

```python
import asyncio
import os

from autogen import ConversableAgent
from semantic_kernel.agents.autogen.autogen_conversable_agent import AutoGenConversableAgent

async def main():
    cathy = ConversableAgent(
        "cathy",
        system_message="Your name is Cathy and you are a part of a duo of comedians.",
        llm_config={
            "config_list": [
                {
                    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
                    "temperature": 0.9,
                    "api_key": os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
                }
            ]
        },
        human_input_mode="NEVER",  # Never ask for human input.
    )

    joe = ConversableAgent(
        "joe",
        system_message="Your name is Joe and you are a part of a duo of comedians.",
        llm_config={
            "config_list": [
                {
                    "model": "gpt-4o",
                    "temperature": 0.7,
                    "api_key": os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
                }
            ]
        },
        human_input_mode="NEVER",  # Never ask for human input.
    )

    # Create the Semantic Kernel AutoGenAgent
    autogen_agent = AutoGenConversableAgent(conversable_agent=cathy)

    async for content in autogen_agent.invoke(
        recipient=joe,
        message="Tell me a joke about NVDA and TESLA stock prices.",
        max_turns=3
    ):
        print(f"# {content.role} - {content.name or '*'}: '{content.content}'")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
