Scrum already covers the roles of the **[Developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLqCkj0PvtE)**, the **[Product Owner](/do-you-know-the-how-to-be-a-good-product-owner)**, and the **[Scrum Master](/the-team-do-you-help-your-scrum-master-not-scrummaster-protect-and-serve-the-team)**, but from a consultancy’s side, there’s also the **Tech Lead** and the **Account Manager** to consider.

Confusion often arises when these roles overlap, especially when sales or account managers step into delivery activities or when tech leads discuss matters outside their scope.

## Account Manager

An Account Manager’s main job is to **own the relationship with the client** and ensure satisfaction, without stepping into daily project delivery. They should support the Tech Lead and Scrum Master, not replace them.

As a guiding principle, Account Managers should not join daily scrums or participate in technical conversations — those are best left to the delivery team. However, relationships are fluid, and occasionally joining a stand-up (e.g., to check in with the client or resolve a relationship issue) may be appropriate. The key is to respect boundaries: don’t manage the project or the technical side of things.

### ❌ Generally avoid

* Joining daily scrums (unless there is a specific relationship issue to address)
* Changing resources mid-week (resourcing changes should be deliberate and always involve the Tech Lead)
* Having technical conversations with the client on the side without the Tech Lead present

### ✅ Focus on

* Managing communication from [initial contact](/do-you-manage-your-inbound-leads-effectively), to the [Initial Meeting](/meetings-do-you-know-the-agenda-for-the-initial-meeting), through to the [Spec Review](/rules-to-better-specification-reviews), until the main body of work is booked
* Managing key relationships and ensuring the client is happy with the Tech Lead and Scrum Master
* Getting [T&Cs](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Forms/ConsultingOrderTermsConditions.aspx) and other required documents signed
* Entering and maintaining CRM data for Companies, Contacts, Opportunities, and [tracked emails](/track-important-emails)
* Handling invoicing
* Leading conflict resolution
* Managing ongoing resourcing and [booking Developers](/scheduling-do-you-know-how-to-book-developers-for-a-project)
* Facilitating budget discussions
* Joining Sprint Reviews periodically (e.g., once a month, or more often if issues arise)

## Tech Lead

### ❌ Generally avoid

* Discussing money or budget directly with the client

### ✅ Focus on

* Displaying ownership of the project while keeping code quality high and technical debt low
* Delivering the project into production
* Spec review and project communication — being the primary communicator with the Product Owner
* DevOps — ensuring good practices are followed (e.g., releasing to production as frequently as possible)
* Taking responsibility for the architecture and technical direction of the project
* Assisting the Account Manager with technical aspects of conflict management
* Monitoring and managing the budget and timelines

    ## Hi &#123;&#123; TECH LEAD &#125;&#125;

According to &#123;&#123; LINK TO CLIENT CRM RECORD &#125;&#125;

As you can see, you are the Tech Lead for &#123;&#123; CLIENT NAME &#125;&#125;.

1. Did you already know this?
2. Read [Do you know the non-Scrum roles of a project?](/know-the-non-scrum-roles) to make sure you know what is involved with this non-Scrum role (it’s not just responsibility of the technical decisions on the project 😉)
3. Of those bullet points listed on the rule... which is your #1?
