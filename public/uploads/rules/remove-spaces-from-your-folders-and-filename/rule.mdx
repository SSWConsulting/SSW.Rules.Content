<introEmbed
  body={<>
It is **not** a good idea to have spaces in a folder or file name as they don't translate to URLs very well and can even cause technical problems.

Instead of using spaces, we **recommend**:

* **kebab-case** - using dashes between words

Other **not recommended** options include:

* **CamelCase** - using the first letter of each word in uppercase and the rest of the word in lowercase
* **snake_case** - using underscores between words

For further information, read [Do you know how to name documents?](/how-to-name-sharepoint-documents)
  </>}
/>
This rule should apply to any file or folder that is on the web. This includes Azure DevOps Team Project names and SharePoint Pages.
