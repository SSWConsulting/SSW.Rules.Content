When you use Check-in policies you often will need to select a work item that you selected recently

Make this easy on yourself by adding a query 'Recent'.

1. Create a work item query that returns you the last changed work item

  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  captionStyle="default"
  captionText={"Add a query just for your associated check ins"}
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-to-make-using-check-in-policies-easier-by-adding-a-recent-query/AddQuery.jpg"
/>


2. Just copy the 'Tasks - My' query
3. Add the sort date of 'Changed Date' sorted by descending

  captionStyle="default"
  captionText={"The query should be sorted by 'Changed Date'"}
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-to-make-using-check-in-policies-easier-by-adding-a-recent-query/SortedByChangedDate.jpg"
/>


4. Use that query on your check ins and you find the relevant work item easily
