Make this easy on yourself by adding a query 'Recent'.

1. Create a work item query that returns you the last changed work item

   
<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Add a query just for your associated check ins",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-to-make-using-check-in-policies-easier-by-adding-a-recent-query/AddQuery.jpg"
/>


2. Just copy the 'Tasks - My' query
3. Add the sort date of 'Changed Date' sorted by descending

   
<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "The query should be sorted by 'Changed Date'",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-to-make-using-check-in-policies-easier-by-adding-a-recent-query/SortedByChangedDate.jpg"
/>


4. Use that query on your check ins and you find the relevant work item easily
