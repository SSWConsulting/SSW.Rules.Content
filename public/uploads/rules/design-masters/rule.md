Waiting for a designer to approve every UI change can block progress. But letting devs make visual tweaks unchecked often leads to messy, inconsistent designs.

Create a “Design Masters” list – a small group of trusted designers and design-literate developers who can approve UI/UX changes when needed.

<!--endintro-->

## Why it helps

* Speeds up decisions on small, non-controversial UI tweaks
* Reduces [design debt](/design-debt)
* Maintains visual consistency

## How to do it

* Designers are always the first choice
* Add developers who understand design and have done basic training  
  E.g. They should meet the following minimum criteria:
  * Achieve at least a **bronze** rating on [Can't Unsee](https://cantunsee.space/)
  * Have read or used these resources:
    * [NNG – 10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)
    * [Who Can Use – Accessibility Contrast Checker](https://www.whocanuse.com/)
    * [Realtime Colors – Color system visualisation](https://www.realtimecolors.com/)
    * [Laws of UX](https://lawsofux.com/)
* Define what changes can be approved (e.g. padding, alignment) and what can’t (e.g. new components). The developer should understand their approval limitations and know when to escalate to a designer
* Create **Employee Responsibilities** for each Design Master  
* Share the list in the **Intranet | Designers**  
* Include this link in the **Induction process** so the whole company is aware and knows how to proceed on design changes

Keep it tight, clear, and maintained – so you stay fast without sacrificing design quality.
