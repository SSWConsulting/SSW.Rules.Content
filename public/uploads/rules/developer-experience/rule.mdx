It's amazing how often you can't simply Clone a repository (aka "Get Latest") and compile it.

A good developer makes it clear how to get a new project, compile it and run it.

    figure: 'In Visual Studio the project setup experience starts with the F5 key!',

### Sometimes the experience is more CLI based

  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'Some consider this rule (Do you get latest and compile) to be more a “git clone” and then “dotnet run”',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}

/>

### Sometimes the experience is more Mac-based
