Moving a rule page from a folder to another is not needed anymore. All rule pages are staying in the same library (folder called "Pages") since we moved the rule pages from 100+ subwebs into the root one.

If you want a rule page to be shown on a different rule summary page, simply change the "Rule Category" field value to the relevant one (see step #7 on [Do you know how to create a rule?](/how-to-create-a-rule))

Sometimes you might need to move a rule from a category to another. You can do this by following these steps:

<endOfIntro />

1. Click on "Site Settings":


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePreset="default"
  figureText={"Make sure you are logged in and click on \"Site Settings\""}
  src="/uploads/rules/how-to-move-a-rule/site-settings.png"
/>


2. Under "Site Administration", click on "Content and structure":


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePreset="default"
  figureText={"Go to \"Content and structure\""}
  src="/uploads/rules/how-to-move-a-rule/content-structure.png"
/>


3. Navigate on the categories and pages to find the rule you want to move:


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePreset="default"
  figureText={"Find the rule to be moved and click on the small arrow beside it, then click on \"Move...\""}
  src="/uploads/rules/how-to-move-a-rule/move-rule.png"
/>


4. Select the new location where the rule should be:


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePreset="default"
  figureText={"Navigate through categories and click on the place the rule should be moved to and click \"OK\""}
  src="/uploads/rules/how-to-move-a-rule/select-new-place.png"
/>
