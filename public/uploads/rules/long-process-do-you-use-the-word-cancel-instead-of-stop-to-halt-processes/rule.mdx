seoDescription: When stopping processes, use "Cancel" instead of "Stop" to clarify
  intentions and avoid miscommunication.
title: Long Process - Do you use the word 'Cancel' (instead of 'Stop') to halt processes?
type: rule
uri: long-process-do-you-use-the-word-cancel-instead-of-stop-to-halt-processes
---

When stopping processes, you should use 'Cancel'... Not 'Stop'. The meaning of 'Cancel' is clearer to users, as opposed to 'Stop' which might also mean 'Pause'.
