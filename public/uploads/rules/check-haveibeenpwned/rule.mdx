When an organisation has a security breach, passwords are compromised and there is no visibility of the problem. This problem means that hackers can gain access to people's accounts without anyone realising what has happened! The project [haveibeenpwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com) is a website that addresses this problem...

haveibeenpwned keeps a record of all known hacks and accounts that have been affected.

It is a good idea to regularly check haveibeenpwned to see if any of your passwords have been exposed. If one of your accounts has been affected, then make sure to change the passwords you use for that account and anywhere else you use that password.

Even better, if you are a superstar 🤩 then the gold standard for password management is to use a [password manager](/password-manager/).
