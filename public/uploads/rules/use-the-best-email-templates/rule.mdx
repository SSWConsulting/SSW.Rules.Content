Email templates can help achieve this by ensuring that all communications are uniform and professional. With many email template options on the market, it is important to choose one that is enterprise ready.

With a variety of options available, each offering unique features for customization, automation, and integration, below is a summary for each of the top contenders.

## Option 1 - Outlook Templates


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    
Simple to create and can be shared easily (e.g., via SharePoint). However, a new email is always generated from these templates, so they cannot be used for email replies or for calendars without manual copying and pasting.

  </>}
  captionStyle="default"
  captionText={""}
/>
**❌ Figure: Bad example - Outlook Templates are easy to share but have limitations with creation and calendar integration**  

More information on [Outlook Templates](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/create-an-email-message-template-43ec7142-4dd0-4351-8727-bd0977b6b2d1).

## Option 2 - My Templates


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    
Simple to create but can't be shared with other users, have a 32KB limit, and are stored on the server in your mailbox.

  </>}
  captionStyle="default"
  captionText={""}
/>
**❌ Figure: Bad example - My Templates are limited in size and sharing capabilities, making them less useful for collaborative environments**

## Option 3 - Signatures


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    
Simple to create but are stored locally, so they can't be shared with other devices or users. Signatures have a 5000 character limit.

  </>}
  captionStyle="default"
  captionText={""}
/>
**❌ Figure: Bad example - Signatures are easy to create but lack sharing capabilities and are limited by storage constraints**  

More information on [Signatures](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/create-and-add-an-email-signature-in-outlook-8ee5d4f4-68fd-464a-a1c1-0e1c80bb27f2).

## Option 4 - Quick Parts


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    
Supports rich text but is stored locally and can't be shared.

  </>}
  captionStyle="default"
  captionText={""}
/>
**❌ Figure: Bad example - Quick Parts are useful for rich text but not suitable for sharing among users**  

More information on [Quick Parts](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/quick-parts-4ffef7c5-7596-4e95-9faf-41c771847a7b).

## Option 5 - Word Documents on SharePoint


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    
Allows for rich text and can be shared with anyone, but requires switching to another window to use.

  </>}
  captionStyle="default"
  captionText={""}
/>
**😐 Figure: OK example - Word documents on SharePoint support rich text and easy sharing, although the process lacks efficiency**  

## Option 6 - Dynamics 365 Email Templates


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    
Offer rich text, can be shared with anyone, and provide access to contact data. However, they are complex to set up, fonts can be tricky, they don't work with meetings, and may involve many clicks to access.

  </>}
  captionStyle="default"
  captionText={""}
/>
**😐 Figure: OK example - Dynamics 365 Email Templates have robust features but are complex to manage and access**  

More information on [Dynamics 365 Email Templates](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365/blog/it-professional/2023/04/10/create-beautiful-email-templates-with-enhanced-email-editor/?WT.mc_id=M365-MVP-33518).

## Option 7 - officeatwork Content Chooser (⭐️ recommended)


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    
Supports rich text and allows for easy sharing via SharePoint. Setup is straightforward—simply upload a Word document. However, templates must be updated manually.

  </>}
  captionStyle="default"
  captionText={""}
/>
**✅ Figure: Good example - officeatwork Content Chooser offers ease of use and sharing, though it requires manual updates**

## ⚠️ Avoid reusing sent emails to generate new ones

Reusing an email from your **Sent Items** can lead to mistakes and miscommunication. It's easy to forget to update key details, such as:

* **Outdated content** (e.g. old dates, names, or figures)
* **Attachments** that are no longer relevant or missing entirely
* **Subject line** (often still prefixed with "RE:")
* **Duplicated email signature**

These small oversights can make your message look unprofessional or cause confusion for the recipient. It’s better to start with a fresh draft from the proper template.
