Passwords are a legacy technology that is not fit for the purpose that we use them today. We're working our way towards a post-password world, in particular the [FIDO alliance](https://fidoalliance.org), and many biometric technologies, including fingerprint and face recognition that you may have in your phone. But for now, passwords are something we all need to live with.

We're used to seeing lists of password requirements, such as:

- Minimum length
- Complexity (e.g. must include upper and lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters)
- Minimum age (e.g. you canâ€™t change it more than once in 24 hours)
- Maximum age (e.g. you must change it every 30 days)

The most important of these is **length**.

Look at this graphic:

    figure: "The Hive Systems password table shows how long it takes to crack passwords of various lengths",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/important-password-aspect/bruteforce-times.png"
/>


This table clearly shows that adding complexity (mixing upper and lower case, adding numbers, adding symbols) **does** increase the time it takes an attacker to brute forces your password, but not by much, and **only** in conjunction with a password of sufficient length.

In 2022, 10 characters should be the **absolute minimum** for a password. 12 characters is a better baseline, and 16 is what you should aim for.
