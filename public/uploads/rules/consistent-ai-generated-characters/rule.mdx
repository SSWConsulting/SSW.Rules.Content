You generate a great AI image for marketing, then the next one looks like a distant cousin of the original. Different face, different colors, different vibe. This inconsistency confuses users and weakens brand recognition, especially when you’re trying to build a recognizable character like a mascot or product hero.

    **Prompt**: “Generate a 3d stylized, cartoon-like yak covering his eyes with his hooves. The yak has small curved horns, shaggy light-brown hair on its head, large expressive eyes, and a friendly, slightly smiling expression. It is wearing a short-sleeved red shirt. The background is plain white, giving the image a clean, studio-like appearance. Make the yak `{{ ACTION }}`”

## Tip 1: Start with a single source-of-truth image

Always begin with **one approved base image** of the character. Ideally this image should be a character sheet, providing different views of the character so that models have more context to work with.

Use this same static image as the reference for:

* Image generation (e.g. OpenAI GPT Image, Google Nano Banana)
* Video/animation generation (e.g. OpenAI Sora, Google Veo)

Store it in a shared, versioned location (e.g. brand assets folder).

  </>}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure=""
  style="yakshaver"
/>

<imageEmbed alt="Character sheet of a stylized 3D cartoon yak with brown fur and curved horns, wearing a red T-shirt and black pants. The image shows multiple views: expressive facial close-ups with different emotions at the top, and full-body front, side, and back views labeled." size="medium" showBorder={false} figurePrefix="good" figure="Character sheet showing various angles and emotions of the YakShaver mascot, Jack the Yak" src="/uploads/rules/consistent-ai-generated-characters/YakShaver-The-Yak-Base-Character-Sheet.png" />

  body={<>
    The TinaCMS team stores their source-of-truth character sheet at [tina.io/media](https://tina.io/media)
  </>}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure=""
  style="info"
/>

<imageEmbed alt="Character sheet of a 3D llama in orange shirt showing multiple facial expressions and front, side, and back views." size="medium" showBorder={false} figurePrefix="good" figure="Character sheet showing various angles and emotions of the Tina mascot, Tina the Llama" src="/uploads/rules/consistent-ai-generated-characters/tina-character-sheet.png" />

While it is better to use the same AI tool for character consistency, different AI tools can still produce consistent results with a high-quality source of truth image.

## Tip 2: Be explicit in your prompts

AI models will improvise unless you clearly tell them not to. Include:

* Instruction to **preserve the original character design**
* Physical traits (species, colors, proportions)
* Clothing or accessories (or explicitly say “no clothing”)
* Mood, personality or expressions
* Camera framing and lighting

  </>}

## Tip 3: Get approvals for generated characters

Before publishing AI-generated characters:

* Get a “[test pass](/request-a-test-please)” from design/brand owners
* For videos/animations, check quality with your video team (e.g. no choppy or awkward movements)
