You generate a great AI image for marketing, then the next one looks like a distant cousin of the original. Different face, different colors, different vibe. This inconsistency confuses users and weakens brand recognition, especially when you’re trying to build a recognizable character like a mascot or product hero.

## 1. Start with a single “source of truth” image

Always begin with **one approved base image** of the character. Ideally this image should be a character sheet, providing different views of the character so that models have more context to work with.

Use this same static image as the reference for:

* Image generation
* Video generation
* Animation tools (e.g. Sora, Veo)

Store it in a shared, versioned location (e.g. design assets folder).

<imageEmbed alt="A smiling cartoon yak wearing a red t-shirt, sitting at a wooden desk and writing on a notepad with a pen." size="medium" showBorder={false} figurePrefix="ok" figure="A single image high-quality of the character." src="/uploads/rules/consistent-ai-generated-characters/YakShaver-The-Yak-Writing-Table.png" />

<imageEmbed alt="Character sheet of a stylized 3D cartoon yak with brown fur and curved horns, wearing a red T-shirt and black pants. The image shows multiple views: expressive facial close-ups with different emotions at the top, and full-body front, side, and back views labeled." size="medium" showBorder={false} figurePrefix="good" figure="A character sheet showing the different angles and emotions of the character." src="/uploads/rules/consistent-ai-generated-characters/YakShaver-The-Yak-Base-Character-Sheet.png" />

## 2. Be explicit in your prompts

AI models will improvise unless you clearly tell them not to.

Include:

* Physical traits (species, colors, proportions)
* Clothing or accessories (or explicitly say “no clothing”)
* Mood, personality or expressions
* Camera framing and lighting
* Instruction to **preserve the original character design**

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    “Animate The Yak covering his eyes”
  </>}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure="The prompt is vague and will lead to inconsistencies."
  style="greybox"
/>

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    "Use the provided image as the exact character reference. Do not change colors, facial features, proportions, or style. Animate The Yak standing and covering his eyes with his hooves."
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Explicitly instructing the model to preserve the original character"
  style="greybox"
/>

## 3. Reuse the same reference across tools

While it is better to use the same AI tool for character consistency, different AI tools can still produce consistent results if you:

* Use the **same base image**
* Reuse or lightly adapt the **same prompt**
* Avoid letting the tool “reimagine” the character

This allows teams to mix tools (e.g. Sora and Gemini) without visual drift.

## 4. Document the process

If one person can do it, others should be able to repeat it.

Document:

* The base image used
* The exact prompts
* The tool and model (e.g. Sora, Gemini Veo)
* Any settings or options selected
* Known limitations or gotchas

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    Base Image: yak-base-character-sheet-v1.png
    
    Tool: Gemini Veo
    
    Prompt: "Use the provided image as the exact character reference. Do not change colors, facial features, proportions, or style. Make a video of The Yak standing up and covering his eyes with his hooves."
    
    Notes: Watch out for hooves turning into hands.
    
    Result: yak-covering-eyes.png
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="A documented, repeatable workflow"
  style="greybox"

## 5. Get approvals for generated characters

Before publishing AI-generated characters:

* Get a “[test pass](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/request-a-test-please)” from design/brand owners
* For animations, check quality with your video team (e.g. no choppy or awkward movements)

Once approved, lock the base image and treat changes as a new version.

## Summary

To keep AI-generated characters consistent:

* Start with one approved base image
* Be explicit in prompts about preserving design
* Reuse the same reference across tools
* Document the workflow so others can repeat it
* Treat AI characters as brand assets, not experiments
