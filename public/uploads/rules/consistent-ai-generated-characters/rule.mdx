You generate a great AI image for marketing, then the next one looks like a distant cousin of the original. Different face, different colors, different vibe. This inconsistency confuses users and weakens brand recognition, especially when you’re trying to build a recognizable character like a mascot or product hero.

## Why consistency matters

A consistent AI-generated character:

* Builds brand recognition and trust
* Feels intentional and professional
* Can be reused across marketing, product demos, and social media
* Saves time by avoiding repeated trial-and-error

If users can’t immediately recognize your character, the AI has failed the brand. Not the other way around.

## Start with a single “source of truth” image

Always begin with **one approved base image** of the character.

Use this same static image as the reference for:

* Image generation
* Video generation
* Animation tools (e.g. Sora, Veo)

Store it in a shared, versioned location (e.g. design assets folder).

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    A single high-quality Yak image is used as the reference input for multiple tools (Sora and Gemini Veo) to generate different animations while preserving the same look.
  </>}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure=""
  style="greybox"
/>

<imageEmbed alt="Image" size="small" showBorder={false} figurePrefix="good" figure="One base image used consistently across multiple AI tools" src="/uploads/rules/consistent-ai-generated-characters%20/yak.png" />

## Be explicit in your prompts

AI models will improvise unless you clearly tell them not to.

Include:

* Physical traits (species, colors, proportions)
* Clothing or accessories (or explicitly say “no clothing”)
* Mood, personality or expressions
* Camera framing and lighting
* Instruction to **preserve the original character design**

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    "Use the provided image as the exact character reference. Do not change colors, facial features, proportions, or style. Animate the Yak standing and covering his eyes with his hooves."
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Explicitly instructing the model to preserve the original character"
  style="greybox"
/>

## Reuse the same reference across tools

While it is better to use the same AI tool for character consistency, different AI tools can still produce consistent results if you:

* Use the **same base image**
* Reuse or lightly adapt the **same prompt**
* Avoid letting the tool “reimagine” the character

This allows teams to mix tools (e.g. Sora and Gemini) without visual drift.

## Document the process

If one person can do it, others should be able to repeat it.

Document:

* The base image used
* The exact prompts
* The tool and model (e.g. Sora, Gemini Veo)
* Any settings or options selected
* Known limitations or gotchas

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    Base Image: yak-base-v1.png
    
    Tool: Gemini Veo
    
    Prompt: "Use the provided image as the exact character reference. Do not change colors, facial features, proportions, or style. Make a video of this Yak standing up and covering his eyes with his hooves."
    
    Notes: Watch out for hooves turning into hands.
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="A documented, repeatable workflow"
/>

## Use approvals for brand assets

Before publishing AI-generated characters:

* Get sign-off from design/brand owners
* Confirm colors match official brand assets
* Check motion quality with your video team (no choppy or awkward transitions)

Once approved, lock the base image and treat changes as a new version.

## Summary

To keep AI-generated characters consistent:

* Start with one approved base image
* Be explicit in prompts about preserving design
* Reuse the same reference across tools
* Document the workflow so others can repeat it
* Treat AI characters as brand assets, not experiments
