You generate a great AI image for marketing, then the next one looks like a distant cousin of the original. Different face, different colors, different vibe. This inconsistency confuses users and weakens brand recognition, especially when you’re trying to build a recognizable character like a mascot or product hero.

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    **Attached file:** N/A
    
    **Prompt**: “Generate a 3d stylized, cartoon-like yak covering his eyes with his hooves. The yak has small curved horns, shaggy light-brown hair on its head, large expressive eyes, and a friendly, slightly smiling expression. It is wearing a short-sleeved red shirt. The background is plain white, giving the image a clean, studio-like appearance. Make the yak `{{ ACTION }}`”
    
    **Action (left to right):** “Cover his eyes with his hooves”, “sit at a table and write on a piece of paper with a pen”, “give a thumbs up”
    
    **Image model (left to right):** Google Whisk, Open AI GPT Image, Google Nano Banana
    
    <imageEmbed alt="Three side-by-side illustrations of a yak character writing at a desk, each rendered in a different visual style." size="large" showBorder={false} figurePrefix="none" figure="" src="/uploads/rules/consistent-ai-generated-characters/Yak-Character-Inconsistent.jpg" />
  </>}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure="The same text prompt produces inconsistent results across different image models"
  style="greybox"
/>

## Step 1: Start with a single source-of-truth image

Always begin with **one approved base image** of the character. Ideally this image should be a character sheet, providing different views of the character so that models have more context to work with.

Use this same static image as the reference for:

* Image generation (e.g. OpenAI GPT Image, Google Nano Banana)
* Video/animation generation (e.g. OpenAI Sora, Google Veo)

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    Make sure to store the source-of-truth in a shared, versioned location (e.g. “brand-assets” folder).
  </>}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure=""
  style="warning"
/>

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    **Attached file:** source-of-truth.png
    
    **Prompt:** “Use the provided character sheet as the exact character reference. Do not change colors, facial features, proportions, or style. Make Jack the Yak `{{ ACTION }}`”
    
    **Action (left to right):** “Cover his eyes with his hooves”, “sit at a table and write on a piece of paper with a pen”, “give a thumbs up”
    
    **Image model (left to right):** Google Whisk, Open AI GPT Image, Google Nano Banana
    
    <imageEmbed alt="Three side-by-side images of the same 3D yak character wearing a red shirt, shown in different poses." size="large" showBorder={false} figurePrefix="none" figure="" src="/uploads/rules/consistent-ai-generated-characters/Yak-Character-Consistent-v3.jpg" />
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="By using a source-of-truth image, you can use shorter prompts and ensure character consistency across different scenarios and models"
  style="greybox"
/>

  body={<>
    **Note:** While it is better to use the same AI tool for character consistency, different AI tools can still produce consistent results with a high-quality source-of-truth image.

### Examples

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    The YakShaver team stores their source-of-truth character sheet at [yakshaver.ai/media](https://yakshaver.ai/media).
    
    <imageEmbed alt="Character sheet of a stylized 3D cartoon yak with brown fur and curved horns, wearing a red T-shirt and black pants. The image shows multiple views: expressive facial close-ups with different emotions at the top, and full-body front, side, and back views labeled." size="medium" showBorder={false} figurePrefix="none" figure="Character sheet showing various angles and emotions of the YakShaver mascot, Jack the Yak" src="/uploads/rules/consistent-ai-generated-characters/YakShaver-The-Yak-Base-Character-Sheet.png" />
  </>}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure=""
  style="greybox"
/>

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    The TinaCMS team stores their source-of-truth character sheet at [tina.io/media](https://tina.io/media)
    
    <imageEmbed alt="Character sheet of a 3D llama in orange shirt showing multiple facial expressions and front, side, and back views." size="medium" showBorder={false} figurePrefix="none" figure="Character sheet showing various angles and emotions of the Tina mascot, Tina the Llama" src="/uploads/rules/consistent-ai-generated-characters/tina-character-sheet.png" />
  </>}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure=""
  style="greybox"
/>

## Step 2: Be explicit in your prompts

AI models will improvise unless you clearly tell them not to. Include:

* Instruction to **preserve the original character design**
* Physical traits (species, colors, proportions)
* Clothing or accessories (or explicitly say “no clothing”)
* Mood, personality or expressions
* Camera framing and lighting

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    **Prompt:** Make Jack the Yak cover his eyes.
  </>}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure="The prompt is vague and will lead to inconsistencies"
  style="greybox"
/>

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    **Prompt:** Use the provided image as the exact character reference. Do not change colors, facial features, proportions, or style. Make Jack the Yak playfully cover his eyes with his hooves in a close-shot.
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Explicitly instructing the model to preserve the original character"
  style="greybox"
/>

## Step 3: Get approvals for generated characters

Before publishing AI-generated characters:

* **All assets** - Get a “[test pass](/request-a-test-please)” from design/brand owners
* **Videos & animations** - Check quality with your video team to prevent choppy footage or awkward animations.
