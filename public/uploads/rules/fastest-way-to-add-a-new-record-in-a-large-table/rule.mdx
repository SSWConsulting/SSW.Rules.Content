  body={<>
When adding a new record should we use **ADO rst.AddNew** or a **SQL INSERT** statement?
  </>}
/>
The **INSERT** statement will give you better performance because you don't have to create and pass around a recordset object. However the **Recordset** object gives you protection from data conflicts by raising an error if the user tries to update a record that has been modified by another user. Also on an error the **Recordset** object will crash out on the offending line, so you can find the problem easier. And when dealing with a memo field, which may contain single quotes or double quotes the **AddNew** method is easier to construct. But in general if you can do without the data conflict protection and want the performance then use the **ADO** connection object to execute a SQL statement.
