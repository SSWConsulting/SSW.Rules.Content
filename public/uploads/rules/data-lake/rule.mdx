Imagine running a business without a clear, unified view of your data. Here's what you might face:

1. **Data Silos:** Different departments hoard their data, making it difficult to gather holistic insights about your business.
2. **Inefficiency:** You spend valuable time integrating data from disparate sources instead of generating insights.
3. **Cost Overruns:** Managing multiple systems for data integration, engineering, warehousing, and business intelligence inflates your costs.
4. **Impaired Decision Making:** Inconsistencies and lack of access to all data hinder informed decision-making.

Typically, companies managed this problem with Data Warehouses like having a SQL Server database to aggregate all their data.

These days, [data lakes](/understanding-data-lakes) make it easy to consolidate all data in an unstructured manner.
