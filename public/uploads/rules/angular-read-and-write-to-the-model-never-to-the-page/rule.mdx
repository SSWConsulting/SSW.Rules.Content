The most common mistake that developers make when moving from jQuery to Angular is that they continue to think about updating the page.

A fundamental principal of Angular is that you build a Model in JavaScript (or TypeScript) and then on your view you just databind your UI elements to the model. Any changes that are made are made to the model and the view updates automatically.

**In Angular, you do not interact with the page you update the model, and the page is just displaying a view of the model.**

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good Example - In both AngularJs & Angular 2.0 jQuery is not required on the view. The view binds to properties on a JavaScript model",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
