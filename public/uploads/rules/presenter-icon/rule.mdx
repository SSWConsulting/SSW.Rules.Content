title: Do you use a presenter icon in multi-speaker presentations?

When sharing the presentation content between a few speakers, it might be hard to remember who is supposed to talk during each slide. You can help this by placing a little icon on your slide.

That way you can passively remind each other who is meant to be presenting at the moment. An extra tip is to avoid displaying the name of the person, because when that presenter is unavailable, the replacement presenter feels untrustworthy to the audience.

The icon allows you to determine whose turn it is to speak, without notifying the audience.

    **Tip:** Put the person's icon in the top right corner of the slide. To make it easier to see at a glance who is meant to be speaking.
