This is the meeting where the Product Owner accepts or rejects the Product Backlog Items (PBIs) done in the Sprint.

The Team, having [prepared](/meeting-do-you-know-what-to-prepare-for-each-meeting) for the meeting, presents the PBIs to the Product Owner.

One person, often the Scrum Master, presents a summary to the Product Owner of the PBIs committed at the Sprint Planning meeting and the done PBIs being presented for acceptance. The Team seeks to have more PBIs accepted than originally committed. It is important that the Product Owner knows at the beginning whether The Team believes that they have over or underachieved the Sprint Goal.

Each done PBI is then presented by the Team for acceptance. They aim to get the PBI accepted as quickly as possible ([aka tick and flick](/tick-and-flick)) while being totally transparent, which includes declaring whether there are any known outstanding bugs (which should already be on the Product Backlog) and adherence to the Team's Definition of Done.

    To keep stakeholders informed beyond the Sprint Review, you should record a [Monthly Stakeholder Video](/monthly-stakeholder-video) to share key progress, blockers, and upcoming priorities.

If a PBI is accepted, but more work needs to be done, a new PBI to cover this work is added to the Product Backlog. Similarly, if a bug is found during the review, it is added to the Product Backlog.

If a PBI is rejected and returned to the Product Backlog but the Sprint itself is accepted, then a careful decision needs to be made. If changes have been checked-in to the Sprint's branch then it must be established that these changes have no adverse effect or they must be carefully undone before the branch is merged with the trunk. For this reason, it is always safer to accept PBIs with conditions rather than reject them.

The Scrum Master keeps the meeting on track and to the Timebox by disallowing discussions not relevant to the acceptance or rejection of the PBI; this is often done by making a note to bring the subject up again in the [Retrospective](/do-you-know-what-happens-at-a-sprint-retrospective-meeting) Meeting.

This meeting is normally timeboxed to as many hours as there are weeks in the Sprint.

### Additional stakeholders

If there are additional stakeholders, make sure they get called in for the summary so they [stay in the loop](/loop-someone-in) and [up to speed on the current increment](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/scrum-trainer_scrum-agile-activity-6815396232366837760-Mhnb/).

* Ping them in a Teams chat when the meeting starts
* [Warn again just before adding them for the summary](/warn-then-call)

<asideEmbed

  body={<>
    **When you ping stakeholders, include a message like this**:

Hey &#123;&#123; PROJECT NAME &#125;&#125; Stakeholders:

I'm recording the current meeting so I can get the Copilot stats later.

I'll call you and the stakeholders in &#123;&#123; XX &#125;&#125; mins, &#123;&#123; PRESENTER NAME &#125;&#125; will run the Sprint Summary.

The stakeholders are:

&#123;&#123; STAKEHOLDER NAME &#125;&#125;,

&#123;&#123; STAKEHOLDER NAME &#125;&#125;,

&#123;&#123; STAKEHOLDER NAME &#125;&#125;

Let me know if you want anyone else added.

### What if you can't attend the Sprint Review

If you can't attend your team's Sprint Review (e.g. you're on leave, working part-time, or in a different timezone), you should give the team a summary of where you're at, so they can inform the stakeholders on your behalf.

* Send a brief "Sprint Review" email to the team to provide them with an update on the status of your tasks. This will enable the team to pass on the information to the client.

    **Not doing Scrum?**

Even if your client does **not** want to do Scrum (they might have had a bad experience in the past) you should still do this step, just under a different name.
E.g. *"Hey Bob, let’s schedule a catch up on Friday. Then I'll show you what I have done this week"*.
