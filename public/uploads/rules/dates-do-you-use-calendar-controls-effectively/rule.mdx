In Outlook, the Calendar control has a number of important features:

* Saturday and Sunday are displayed at the _end_
* Days that have data associated with them are **bold**
* The current day is highlighted with a box
Users are familiar with the Outlook calendar control. When the calendar control is used it should incorporate all of these features of the Outlook calendar control.
