Often we use Azure VM's for presentations, training and development. As there is a cost involved to store and use the VM it is important to ensure that the VM is shutdown when it is no longer required.

Shutting down the VM will prevent compute charges from incurring. There is still a cost involved for the storage of the VHD files but these charges are a lot less than the compute charges.

Please note that is for [Visual Studio subscriptions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/developer-tools/visual-studio-subscriptions/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-33518).

You can shutdown the VM by either making a remote desktop connection to the VM and shutdown server or using Azure portal to shutdown the VM.
