**Problem Steps Recorder** is a useful tool that allows anyone to capture details of a bug. Best of all, It's already installed on your Windows PC!
  </>}
/>
Bug reports can come from anywhere and anyone - the more people reporting back, the better.

Once a problem has been discovered, it helps to collect as much information as possible. Although there are many useful tools you can give to your test team, Problem Details Recorder has one big advantage: It's shipped with Windows since Windows 7 so anyone can record details of their issue with no preinstalled software.

Once recording, the user can repeat whatever steps to reproduce an issue.
