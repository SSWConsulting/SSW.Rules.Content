Breadcrumbs are an essential part of website navigation, providing users with a trail of links to indicate their location within a site's hierarchy. To maximize their effectiveness, it's important to keep breadcrumbs short and concise. By simplifying them, we reduce confusion and make them easier to understand, improving the overall user experience.

Shortening breadcrumbs helps prevent information overload, ensuring that users can quickly scan and comprehend the trail without feeling overwhelmed by long and repeated texts. Some ways to achieve that:

- Replace "Home" with an icon
- Keep only the main words for categories
- Replace the current page title with "This Page"
