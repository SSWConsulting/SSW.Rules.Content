The Marketing Automation inside Microsoft Dynamics Marketing is very powerful and easy to use. You have the following options when creating these:
**Action Type**

- Email
- Landing Page (used to collect data and make leads)
- Task
- Scoring (leads created through MDM can be scored to rank them appropriately)
- Social Media
- Edit Marketing List (e.g. adding people to a “follow up later” list)
- Printed Mail
- Event

**Marketing Lists**

- Static (stored and manipulated in MDM)
- Dynamic (the result of an on the spot query)

**Response**

- Scheduler (e.g. to delay x days before doing the next step
- Trigger (e.g. if someone goes to an event)
