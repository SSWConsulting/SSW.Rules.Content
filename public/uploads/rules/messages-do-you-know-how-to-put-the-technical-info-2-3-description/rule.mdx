#### Description

The description should explain _what the error was_, followed by the _why it occurred_. Information that is useful for debugging should be included with errors where possible in a "Details" section. You should also avoid making the text unnecessarily wide. e.g.
  </>}
/>

- This is confusing, because it uses different terminology to the title ("estimate" instead of "quote")
- There is no punctuation
- The word "Error" is meaningless
- Line breaks are not present, so the message box is too wide and the text may wrap in the wrong spot

  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good Example - A message box that is clear, consistent and intuitive",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/messages-do-you-know-how-to-put-the-technical-info-2-3-description/GoodMessageBox.gif"
/>


- Terminology is consistent
- Punctuation is present
- "Details" indicates that this information is useful for debugging
- The text is split across three lines, and the technical information after Details is separated from the description of the error
