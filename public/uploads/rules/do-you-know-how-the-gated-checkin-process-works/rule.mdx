Gated Checkins are great for verifying your project builds successfully before a checkin occurs, but the workflow and dialog messages can be difficult to follow. Sometimes it’s not clear what you need to do next as a developer.
  </>}
/>
The process for a project with a Gated Checkin build is:

1. The developer clicks **Check In**
2. Changes are not checked in, but are shelved and a build is queued
3. The developer is notified when a build succeeds and prompted to “Reconcile” their workspace

**Note:** This relies on the **Build Notifications** tool running, which may not be the case. If it’s not running, the developer has to manually reconcile their workspace before they can effectively continue working.

    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-how-the-gated-checkin-process-works/gated-checkin-1.jpg"
/>

If you don't have the **Build Notifications** tool running or you click **Ignore**, you will have to manually reconcile. There are a few ways to do this.

You can click **Check In** again. This will fail, but any files you’re trying to check in will be reconciled as a result. You should definitely not do this if you’ve made additional changes since checking in.

  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: 'Bad Example - Reconcile by clicking "Check In" again.  This will fail, but any files you\'re trying to check in will be reconciled.',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-how-the-gated-checkin-process-works/gated-checkin-2.jpg"
/>

Alternatively, you can open the queued build and choose **Actions | Reconcile Workspace...** to fix your workspace

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: 'OK Example – Open the Build and choose Actions | Reconcile Workspace...',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-how-the-gated-checkin-process-works/gated-checkin-3.jpg"
/>

The best way is to click the link in the notification to open a specific build window with a **Reconcile Workspace** link included.
**Note:** This notification will disappear if you close it or navigate away from the **Pending Changes** window in **Team Explorer**.

<imageEmbed

  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: 'Good Example #1 – Click the link in the notification after clicking Check In',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-how-the-gated-checkin-process-works/gated-checkin-4.jpg"
/>

<imageEmbed

  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: 'Good Example #2 – Click on the link in the notification to open the build, then click Reconcile Workspace when the build finishes',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
