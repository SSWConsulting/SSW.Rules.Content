We use **SSWPackage.exe**

The long answer - Deploying changes between development, staging and production servers can be a very interesting exercise:

- It is painstakingly awkward when you realize that you have forgotten a file
- Or forgotten to take the latest version of a particular file
- Each iteration is manual and can be error prone
- The result is that your developers are working late into the evening and your SharePoint servers are down for a prolonged period of time – something that may be very difficult to accept in a corporate environment

At SSW, we saw all this was unacceptable and work to improve this process.

Our answer to the deployment problem is a combination of tools and processes – we call it the **SSWpackage.exe**.

- **Multiple development virtual machine environments**
  - Test repeated deployment to staging before you actually deploy to the production server
- **SSW SharePoint Deployment Auditor** – compares development, staging and production servers to identify missing files that needs to be deployed
  - Specify ignore lists
  - Spits out XML code that would be easy to add to your package xml
- **SSW Package Updater** – updates the solution package based on the XML definitions
  - Ensure you always have the latest version of the files from development SharePoint included in your package.
- **Microsoft Visual Studio** extensions for Windows SharePoint Services
  - Using the latest VSeWSS 1.3 CTP
  - Generates the package and batch files
- **SharePoint STSADM** tool for deployment

Into the future of **SSWPackage.exe**:

- Fully continuous integration with SharePoint
- More SharePoint validation functions
- Improved versioning control
- A great GUI to bring it all together
