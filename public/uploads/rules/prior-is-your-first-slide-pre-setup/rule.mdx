seoDescription: Prior to a presentation, set up your web pages and demos to ensure
  a smoother delivery and avoid reliance on good fortune.
title: Prior - Is your first slide 'Pre-setup'?

You may be a natural-born public speaker, but you will not be able to 'wing' a presentation. Setting up a presentation takes time and practice. You want web pages already open, you want VMs ready and demos good to go.

<endIntro />

So document the steps to undertake before starting and you will present in a snappier fashion and not need to say the lame statement "hope the demo gods are kind to me today".
