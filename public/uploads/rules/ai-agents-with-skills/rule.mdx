Skills (slash commands) let you package reusable prompts that standardize how AI agents approach recurring tasks. Instead of retyping the same detailed instructions every time, you define them once and invoke them with a command.

<endIntro />

## What is a skill?

A **skill** is a markdown file containing a prompt that gets injected into the AI agent's context when invoked. Think of skills like reusable prompt templates - they guide the agent's behavior for a specific task without needing access to external systems (unlike MCP servers).

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    ```markdown
    ---
    name: security-review
    description: Review code for security, performance, and standards compliance
    ---
    
    Review the code changes in the current diff for:
    - Security vulnerabilities (injection, auth issues, data exposure)
    - Performance problems (N+1 queries, unnecessary allocations)
    - Adherence to our team's coding standards
    
    For each issue found:
    1. Reference the specific file and line number
    2. Explain why it's a problem
    3. Suggest a concrete fix
    ```
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="A SKILL.md file with YAML frontmatter (between --- markers) and markdown instructions"
  style="greybox"
/>

To invoke this skill, type `/security-review` in Claude Code, `@security-review` in GitHub Copilot, or simply ask a question that matches the skill's description and the agent will load it automatically.

For connecting to external systems like databases or APIs, use [MCP servers](/rules/mcp-servers-for-context) instead.

## When to use skills

You don't always need to write skills from scratch. Trusted providers like [Anthropic publish pre-built skills you can install](https://github.com/anthropics/skills). For example, Anthropic's official skills repository includes document skills, creative design skills, and development utilities. In Claude Code, you can install them via the plugin system:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add anthropics/skills
/plugin install document-skills@anthropic-agent-skills
```

Consider creating a skill when:

* **You're repeating the same instructions** - if you keep typing the same prompt for code reviews, commit messages, or planning tasks, package it as a skill
* **You need consistent output** - when a task must follow a specific format or checklist every time (e.g. PR descriptions, architecture decision records)
* **You're working with internal frameworks** - domain specific language or internal tools that aren't well-represented in the AI's training data benefit from explicit guidance
* **You're onboarding team members** - skills encode tribal knowledge so everyone gets consistent results from day one

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    **User:** Review this code for security vulnerabilities, performance issues, adherence to our team's coding standards, and test coverage gaps. Provide actionable feedback with specific line references.
    
    **Agent:** ✅ Code review complete.

## Using skills safely

<boxEmbed

    Skills are prompt injections by design - they instruct the AI to behave in a specific way. A malicious skill could instruct the agent to run destructive commands, exfiltrate data, or bypass safety checks.

* **Always read the full contents of a skill before using it** - never blindly trust a skill file, even from a seemingly reputable source
* **Avoid skills from third-party marketplaces or untrusted sources** - treat installing a skill with the same caution as running an unknown script, we consider skills from sources such as Anthropic and OpenAI to be trusted sources
* **Review skill changes in PRs** - when a teammate updates a skill, review it like you would review code
* **Be cautious of skills that run shell commands** - skills that instruct the agent to execute commands or access sensitive files deserve extra scrutiny

## Setting up skills

### Claude Code

Create a `SKILL.md` file inside a named directory under `.claude/skills/`:

```
.claude/
└── skills/
    ├── security-review/
    │   └── SKILL.md       → invoked with /security-review
    ├── commit/
    │   └── SKILL.md       → invoked with /commit
    └── plan/
        └── SKILL.md       → invoked with /plan
```

You can also create personal skills at `~/.claude/skills/` that are available across all projects.

### GitHub Copilot

Create markdown files in your project's `.github/copilot/` directory to define custom agents:

```
.github/
└── copilot/
    ├── review.md        → invoked with @security-review
    └── plan.md          → invoked with @plan
```

### OpenCode

Create a `SKILL.md` file inside a named directory under `.opencode/skills/` (OpenCode also discovers skills from `.claude/skills/`):

```
.opencode/
└── skills/
    ├── security-review/
    │   └── SKILL.md       → invoked as a slash command or loaded by the agent
    └── plan/
        └── SKILL.md
```

You can also create personal skills at `~/.config/opencode/skills/` that are available across all projects.

## Writing effective skills

A good skill is specific about what the agent should do, how it should structure its output, and what it should avoid.

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    ```markdown
    Review the code and give feedback.
    ```
  </>}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure="Too vague - the agent has no guidance on what to check or how to structure its response"
  style="greybox"
/>

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    ```markdown
    ---
    name: code-review
    description: Review code for security, performance, standards, and test coverage
    allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob
    ---
    
    Review the code changes in the current diff for:
    - Security vulnerabilities (injection, auth issues, data exposure)
    - Performance problems (N+1 queries, unnecessary allocations, missing indexes)
    - Adherence to our team's coding standards (which can be found in STANDARDS.md)
    - Test coverage gaps
    
    For each issue found:
    1. Reference the specific file and line number
    2. Explain why it's a problem
    3. Suggest a concrete fix
    
    If no issues are found in a category, skip it — do not
    list categories with "no issues found."
    ```
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Specific checks, clear output format, and explicit instructions on what to skip"
  style="greybox"
/>

Tips for writing skills:

* **One task per skill** - a focused skill is easier to maintain and produces more consistent results than one that tries to handle multiple scenarios
* **Specify the output format** - tell the agent exactly how to structure its response (bullet points, markdown headings, numbered steps, etc.)
* **Include constraints** - explicitly state what the agent should *not* do to prevent unwanted behavior
* **Use variables where supported** - some tools support `$ARGUMENTS` or similar placeholders so users can pass context when invoking the skill

### Frontmatter properties

Here are some common properties to include, you can view the full spec here: [https://agentskills.io/specification#frontmatter-required](https://agentskills.io/specification#frontmatter-required).

| Property                   | Description                                                                              |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`                     | Display name for the skill (defaults to the directory name)                              |
| `description`              | What the skill does - the agent uses this to decide when to load the skill automatically |
| `allowed-tools`            | Restricts which tools the agent can use (e.g. `Read, Grep, Glob` for a read-only skill)  |
| `disable-model-invocation` | Set to `true` to prevent the agent from loading the skill automatically (manual-only)    |
| `user-invocable`           | Set to `false` to hide from the `/` menu (agent-only background knowledge)               |
| `context`                  | Set to `fork` to run the skill in an isolated subagent                                   |
| `argument-hint`            | Hint shown during autocomplete (e.g. `[issue-number]`)                                   |

### Skill scope

Where you store a skill determines who can use it:

| Scope    | Location                                            | Applies to                                             |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Personal | `~/.claude/skills/` or `~/.config/opencode/skills/` | Across all projects, only your machine                 |
| Project  | `.claude/skills/` committed to the repository       | Project-scoped, everyone with access to the repository |

**Personal skills** are great for your own preferences and workflows (e.g. your preferred commit message format). **Project skills** are committed to version control so the whole team benefits. When a personal and project skill share the same name, project-level skills take precedence.

## Sharing skills across a team

Project-level skills (committed to the repo) are one of the most effective ways to standardize workflows across a team:

* **Commit skills to version control** - store them in the project's commands directory so everyone on the team benefits
* **Review changes like code** - skill updates should go through the same PR review process as any other change
* **Reference skills in your README** - mention available skills in your project's README so contributors know what's available (e.g. "Run `/code-review` for a code review" or "Use `/deploy` to deploy to staging")
* **Combine with MCP servers when needed** - use skills to define *how* the agent should work and [MCP servers](/mcp-servers-for-context) to provide *what data* it can access
