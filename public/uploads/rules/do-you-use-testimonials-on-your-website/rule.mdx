Testimonials are a great way of making people comfortable with dealing with your company. They give the website a positive vibe and provide users with something relational that they will identify with (problems solved, needs met, people made happy, economic crisis avoided, etc.)

SSW have a random testimonials box up the top of many pages. One example is the [About Us](https://www.ssw.com.au/company/about-us) page.
