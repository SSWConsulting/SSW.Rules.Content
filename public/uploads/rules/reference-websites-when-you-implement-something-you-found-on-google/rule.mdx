If you end up using someone else's code, or even idea, that you found online, make sure you add a reference to this in your source code. There is a good chance that you or your team will revisit the website. And of course, it never hurts to tip your hat, to thank other coders.

```csharp
private void HideToSystemTray()
{
       // Hide the windows form in the system tray
       if (FormWindowState.Minimized == WindowState)
       {
              Hide();
       }
}
```
**❌ Bad example - The website where the solution was found IS NOT referenced in the comments**  

```csharp
private void HideToSystemTray()
{
       // Hide the windows form in the system tray
       // I found this solution at http://www.developer.com/net/csharp/article.php/3336751
       if (FormWindowState.Minimized == WindowState)
       {
              Hide();
       }
}
```
