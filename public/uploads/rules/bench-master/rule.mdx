The role of a "Bench Master" is critical in ensuring a smooth transition for developers between client projects, minimizing downtime, and promoting ongoing learning and development.

## Bench Master principles?

* Transparency – Keep managers informed about team assignments and movements.
* Negotiation – Enable people to work on projects and teams they’re interested in.
* Prioritisation – Align project capacity with business priority.

A Bench Master's primary responsibility is to ensure that all developers know what they are working on when they are not on client projects. To accomplish this, the Bench Master has these responsibilities:

1. Responsibility - This role is a Bench Masters number 1 responsibility
2. Responsibility - Maintaining a list of internal projects in priority order
3. Responsibility - Allocating new employees or employees finished on a project to a Scrum team. The Bench Master helps the employees to join the team that best fits them based on things like what they want to learn, the people in their office, etc.
4. Process - Weekly [Priority Alignment](/internal-priority-alignment/) meeting with stakeholders
