In any organization that juggles multiple internal projects, having clear coordination and allocation of resources is essential. The role of a "Bench Master" helps to achieve this by acting as the broker between the developers and the business. When a developer doesn't know where to go, they can come to the Bench Master for help!

## Bench Master principles

* **Transparency**: Business owners and employees work best when they know what's going on. Surprises are rarely a good thing.
* **Negotiation**: Business owners and employees should feel that their needs are being catered to.
* **Prioritisation**: Business owners and employees mutually benefit from high-value projects being work

## What does a Bench Master do?

A Bench Master's primary goal is to act as the bridge between the business and the internal team members. To do this, it's the Bench Master's goal to best negotiate and consolidate these key points on the side of the Employee and the Business.

### From the Business's Perspective

* **Alignment**: Teams resourcing should be aligned with the business owner's priorities. Highest priority projects should get the most resourcing.
* **Company Knowledge**: Employee's learning and professional development should align well with the company's business goals.

### From the Employee's Perspective

* **Professional Development**: Team members should be working on projects that are in their field of interest and align well with their professional goals.
* **Location**: Team members should work with the people in their office where possible to form strong social connections and cultivate a strong sense of camaraderie.
* **Movement**: Team members should always feel comfortable asking to move off a project and move to another for whatever reason.
