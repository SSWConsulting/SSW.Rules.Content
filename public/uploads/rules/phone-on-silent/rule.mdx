We all rely on our phones, but loud ringtones can quickly disrupt meetings and conversations. If you were mid-discussion and someone’s phone started blaring, would you want them to stop and answer? Probably not.

Your phone is a powerful tool — but it’s also one of the biggest sources of distraction. Keep it on **silent** or **focus mode** so you can stay present and respect those around you.

If you wear a connected device (like an Apple Watch, Fitbit, or similar), use it for discreet alerts. A subtle vibration is all you need to know when someone’s calling — no ringtone required.

    **Tip:** Many wearables even let you reply with a quick message to say you’re busy, without interrupting your flow.
