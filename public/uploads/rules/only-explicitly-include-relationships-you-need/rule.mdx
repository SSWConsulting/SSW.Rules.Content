Often developers will include all the related entities in a query to help with debugging. Always remember to take these out. They cause excessive database load.
  </>}
/>
If you need the related entities, then that is what Include is for.

```cs
var query = _dbContext
        .Sales
        .Include(x => x.SalesPerson);
```
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Figure: Bad example - Retrieved the sales records and the salesperson, even though we don't intend to use the salesperson record.",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


```cs
var query = _dbContext
        .Sales;
```
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "Figure: Good example - Retrieved only the sales records themselves",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />
