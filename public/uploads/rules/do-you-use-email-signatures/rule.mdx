Email signatures are a great way of adding some advertising and branding. You should always use a nice email signature for **external emails** .
Internally, you shouldn't use any or just use a short one (just your name or initials)

### What about appointments?

Appointments going to people outside the organisation should be written and addressed the way you would an email. This includes using your email signature.
