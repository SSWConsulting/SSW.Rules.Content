A report should never take more than 30 seconds to run. Slow reports frustrate users, and also take valuable server performance away from the report server.

When dealing with slow reports, it is a good idea to setup scheduled snapshots. As an example,  you would schedule a long running report to create a snapshot at night when the server is idle and not under a lot of stress. We recommend creating new snapshots every night so that the information displayed in the reports is never more than 24 hours old.

As an example:

**Do** create a snapshot for a sales summary
**Do not** create a snapshot for an invoice report

For information on setting up scheduled snapshots see the following [KB article](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/KB/KB.aspx?KBID=Q1119699)
