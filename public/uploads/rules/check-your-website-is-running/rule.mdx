If you want to know your website is working or not, you need to add a ping check to the machine also an HTTP Content Scan to the website in WhatsUp. We use WhatsUp to do real-time monitoring.
Follow these steps to check your website in WhatsUp:

<endIntro />

1. Add your website as a new device.

  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure="New device"
  src="/uploads/rules/check-your-website-is-running/running1.gif"
/>


2. Ping monitor is added automatically.

  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure="Ping monitor"
  src="/uploads/rules/check-your-website-is-running/running2.gif"
/>


3. Add an HTTP Content Scan monitor.
   
<imageEmbed

  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure="HTTP Content Scan"
  src="/uploads/rules/check-your-website-is-running/running3.gif"
/>


4. Edit the scan script. In the script, you can see 2 keywords "Send" and "Expect".
   "Send" expression is an HTTP request to your website.
   "Expect" expression is a regular expression to check the key word in response from your website.

  figurePrefix="none"
  figure="Edit scan script"
  src="/uploads/rules/check-your-website-is-running/running4.gif"
/>


5. Add the monitor to your device.
   
<imageEmbed

  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure="Add monitor"
  src="/uploads/rules/check-your-website-is-running/running5.gif"
/>

    Once a device is down or up, a WhatsUp action will tell SQL Reporting Services to send out a notification report.
   Our report looks like this:
   
<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure="Website doesn't work"
  src="/uploads/rules/check-your-website-is-running/running6.gif"
/>



<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure="Website works"
  src="/uploads/rules/check-your-website-is-running/running7.gif"
/>
