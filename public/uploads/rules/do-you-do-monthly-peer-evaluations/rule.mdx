seoDescription: Improve team productivity and working environment through regular
  peer evaluations, fostering constructive feedback and growth.

Encouraging your team to evaluate their peers is a proven method to improve working environment and productivity.

<endIntro />

All peers that worked together should evaluate each other by filling a Peer Evaluation Email every month.

The evaluation is done by giving constructive comments in “Start, Stop, Continue”
e.g. (Start...) checking in with better comments
 e.g. (Stop...) coding without a user story
 e.g. (Continue...) with your helpful SEO comments
