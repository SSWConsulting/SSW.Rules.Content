It is extremely important to maintain honesty and candor in a team environment. Sometimes this means admitting when you're uncertain and not just communicating wishful thinking.

Being candid doesn’t mean being harsh—it means being transparent and constructive, so everyone can grow and make better decisions together.

You also need to make sure you qualify your level of certainty in an answer, so that your guess (which could be wrong) does not end up misleading someone.
