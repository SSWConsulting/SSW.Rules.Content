<introEmbed

So you can see what functions are being used more often (e.g. reports, menu items).
  </>}
/>
Plus, you can work out what fields to show on search pages (standard and advanced tabs) and which parameters are being used.

<imageEmbed

  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Keep track of what terms are searched most often",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-log-usage/GoodLogUsage.png"
/>


You can achieve this with Redgate's [Feature Usage Reporting](http://www.red-gate.com/products/dotnet-development/smartassembly/).
