So you can see what functions are being used more often (e.g. reports, menu items).

Plus, you can work out what fields to show on search pages (standard and advanced tabs) and which parameters are being used.

    figure: 'Keep track of what terms are searched most often',

You can achieve this with Redgate's [Feature Usage Reporting](http://www.red-gate.com/products/dotnet-development/smartassembly/).
