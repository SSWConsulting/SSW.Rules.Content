  body={<>
Many developers worry about Idempotency. They make sure that their scripts can run multiple times without it affecting the database, upon subsequent running of the script.

This usually involves a check at the start to see if the object exists or not.
E.g. If this table exists, then don't create the table.

Seems popular, seems like a good idea, right? Wrong! And here is why.

Database scripts should be run in order (into separate sequential files), as per the rule [Do you script out all changes?](/script-out-all-changes)

Therefore developers should not worry about idempotency, as the script will run in the order it was created. Actually, if they are doing this, then **they want to see the errors**. It means that the database is not in the state that they expect.

```sql
IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM
               INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
           WHERE
               TABLE_TYPE='BASE TABLE' AND
               TABLE_NAME='Employees'
           )
    ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Employees]( …… ) ON [PRIMARY]
ELSE
    CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Employees]( …… ) ON [PRIMARY]
```
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Bad example – worrying about the idempotency should not be done, if you plan to run your scripts in the order they were created",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


```sql
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Employees](
    ……
) ON [PRIMARY]
```
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "Good example – not worrying about the idempotency. If errors occur we don’t want them to be hidden + it is easier to read",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />
