    **Update:** This has been properly fixed since Angular 4. So now, this rule is irrelevant as Angular CLI provides a pleasant development workflow. Using ng serve, TypeScript transpilation occurs automatically and quickly (almost instantly).

When dealing with client-side development – especially when transpiling TypeScript – it is common to have to wait for several seconds between writing code, and seeing the results.

This adds up quickly – if you have to wait for 5 seconds every 3 minutes, you've spent 13 minutes of your day just _waiting_. This is a conservative estimate - we change code much more frequently than every 3 minutes!

<endOfIntro />

A naive development experience is as follows:


<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    
1. Make a code change using a misconfigured IDE
   - See errors everywhere as you type (even though the code is perfectly fine)
   - Inaccurate IntelliSense information
2. Compile the code
   - Since the TypeScript compilation task is often part of the project build, this is a common way to recompile to JavaScript
3. Run a gulp task to copy files around appropriately
   - This often takes a few seconds to run, especially if it “cleans” the folder beforehand
4. Refresh the page
   - Depending on the setup, this may take anywhere from milliseconds to seconds
5. Click around until the app is in the right state to test the functionality
   - If there is too much built-up state, and no routes set up, this chews up time

  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Bad example - Many hours each week are wasted just waiting for the code you wrote to run",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


A more ideal workflow is:


<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    
1. Make the change using a properly configured IDE
   - One that only shows errors when they’re appropriate
   - Intellisense shows everything available, and nothing more
2. Refresh the page (maybe)
   - With well set up watches for compilation and appropriate use of BrowserLink or LiveReload, this is very fast
   - With proper bundling, the initial page load is also fast in development environments.
3. Already be at the component required, ready to check it works

  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "Good example - No time is wasted doing repetitive and slow tasks",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


**Remember** : Spending 4 hours setting up a good dev experience will pay for itself within the week, and make your work like much happier.

### Guidelines to follow

- Ensure that only the files that are changed need to be compiled – TypeScript handles this quite well with --watch
- Avoid the use of task runners (eg. gulp) as part of your development flow. A few watches should be all you need. Save the task runners for release builds
- Consider separate index pages for production and development, using the dev libraries for development, and minified/bundled ones for production
- Use module loaders (eg. SystemJS) to manage dependencies and their associated bundlers/builders for releases
- Load 3rd party modules (eg. Angular2 and Rx) as a bundle, not as their individual files – speed up development first-page load
- Think about your routing – a refresh should almost always return the page to the exact same state or at the very least, the same screen
- Most importantly, **be unsatisfied** - if things are slow, fix it. If you constantly have to manually close IISExpress to run your app, _find out why_ and fix it! You will save everyone time in the long run
