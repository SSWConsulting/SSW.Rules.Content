seoDescription: Anchor tags should run at server only when needed to change target
  at runtime, avoiding unnecessary overhead.

**&lt;a&gt;** tag should **runat=“server"** \*ONLY\* if you need to change the target at runtime.

If you include **runat=“server"** for an HTML element that you do not need access to in code behind, you are introducing a whole lot of overhead you do not need.

We have a program called [SSW Code Auditor](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/) to check for this rule.
