[PNG](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/) is an alternative to JPG, heavily endorsed by some circles, mainly because of its open source and non-commercial nature.

PNG boasts:

* Alpha blending (24 bit transparency map support)
* Unlimited and limited color palettes. This makes it a good alternative to BMP.
* Multiple CRCs so that file integrity can be checked without viewing

However, it has rather poor file compression and should be used sparingly.
