Having people report bounce back emails is frustrating and time consuming. The first thing to try when you get a report is to check that your mail server isn’t on a spam blacklist. An easy way to check this is via [MX Toolbox](http://mxtoolbox.com/).

/>


Next step check that you have primary and secondary (and even better tertiary) MX records setup and working.

/>


If success on both steps the error is most likely on the senders side. Send them the an email to check their mail settings.

Dear xxx,

As per [this rule on bounced emails](/bounces-do-you-know-what-to-do-with-bounced-email)

* I have checked Step 1 – it is good
* I have checked Step 2 – it is good

The problem is likely your end
