To share a draft of a post with others you need to install [the plugin called 'Public Post Preview'](https://wordpress.org/plugins/public-post-preview/).
Once you have plugin installed, all you need to do is enable it and then follow the steps below:

1. In the 'Edit Post' page, scroll down below your HTML panel to the 'Preview' panel, and select the tick box "Allow Anonymous Preview".

Once enabled, it will create a preview link, that you can send to as many people as you like.

**Note:** Once you publish the post that URL becomes inactive.

2. Click on 'Save Draft', then 'Preview'. The post will open in your browser, with the URL that you can share.

  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'How to enable ‘Allow Anonymous Preview’ so you can share your URL before going live',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}

/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'The URL suffix will be similar to this: ‘…?p=1418&preview=true’',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-how-to-share-a-private-link-of-a-draft-post/wp-preview-url.jpg"
/>

It has a time limit function for the post, which allows you to set and extend. The URL it generates is a bit messy.

  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'The URL is pretty messy and it is not as simple as just ticking a box. This is a whole other page',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-how-to-share-a-private-link-of-a-draft-post/wp-share-draft-screenshot.jpg"
/>

**Note:** Needing a plugin to share a URL privately seems a little bit crazy.
**Note:** Another solution is ‘Share a Draft’, however it has more options and is more complicated.
