There are many tools used to communicate and collaborate online. The most efficient platforms for chats and calls are:
- **[Teams](https://products.office.com/en-ca/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software)**
- **[Skype](https://www.skype.com/)**
- **[Slack](https://slack.com/)**

We think [Viva Engage](https://www.yammer.com/) could soon be decommissioned to reduce confusion.
