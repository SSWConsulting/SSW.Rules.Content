If you have database driven pages on your website, you need a way of updating the data quickly and easily. **Each page should have an 'Edit' link** - only visible when the site is running internally or in administrator mode - that takes you directly to the page for editing the content on that page.

The exception to this is if you are using open-source data. [SSW.People](https://ssw.com.au/people/) is a good example of this.

From Github, you can edit and submit a pull request. See https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.People.Profiles/wiki (SSW People) or https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Rules.Content/wiki (SSW Rules) for more details.

This is better than sending a ['Change from X to Y' email](/do-you-ask-for-content-changes-using-from-x-to-y) as the work can be done immediately with less work and management requirements.
