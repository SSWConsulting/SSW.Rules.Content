It’s painful when a client finds out indirectly (e.g. via LinkedIn) that a developer they worked with has left your company. It makes them feel unimportant and may damage trust. Even worse is when the client discovers it by seeing someone else join a call without any explanation.

    A client shows up to a scheduled call and realizes someone new is attending without prior notice. They ask, _"Where is &#123;&#123; DEVELOPER &#125;&#125;?"_ and find out then that he left a week ago.

    The client receives a phone call as soon as the developer resigns, and during the call, they discuss the plan moving forward. This is immediately followed by a professional confirmation email.

When a developer resigns, you must immediately inform the client. We believe in being transparent and professional, ensuring the client is included in the transition plan.

## Why this matters

* It shows respect for the client
* It avoids awkward surprises
* It maintains project continuity and trust
* It gives the client options and involvement in replacement decisions

## Best practice process

1. **Call the client** as soon as possible to inform them and discuss next steps
2. **Send a follow-up email** confirming what was discussed (["As per our conversation"](/as-per-our-conversation-emails))
3. **Focus on options and reassurance**

Here's a good template for your follow-up email:

<emailEmbed
  from=""
  to="&#123;&#123; CLIENT NAME &#125;&#125;"
  cc=""
  bcc=""
  subject="&#123;&#123; EMPLOYEE &#125;&#125; has resigned - Project Transition Plan"
  shouldDisplayBody={true}
  body={<>
    ## Hi &#123;&#123; CLIENT NAME &#125;&#125;

As per our conversation, I’m sorry to let you know that &#123;&#123; EMPLOYEE &#125;&#125; has resigned from SSW.

He is a strong developer and has assured me he will continue to give 100% on your project until his last day, which will be &#123;&#123; DATE &#125;&#125;.

We discussed the following plan:
* &#123;&#123; SUMMARY OF AGREED REPLACEMENT OR TRANSITION &#125;&#125;

If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to reach out.

Kind regards,
&#123;&#123; YOUR NAME &#125;&#125;
  </>}

## Important points

* **Personal touch first** - A real conversation before an email is critical
* **Transparency** - Clients appreciate honesty. Don't wait for them to find out themselves
* **Reassure and give options** - Let the client know that quality will not drop, and show them options they can choose from
* **Handovers** - Remind the departing employee to follow [handover standards](/hand-over-projects)
* **Confirm in writing** - As a final step, send an email to confirm the conversation and actions

By handling developer resignations properly, you keep your client relationships strong, even through periods of change.
