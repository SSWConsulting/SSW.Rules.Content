Better way
The better way is to set up User Profile Synchronization and have SharePoint communicate with Active Directory on a schedule and keep user's profile information up to date. Unfortunately, it can be tricky to set this up in SharePoint 2010.

When a user is entered (or using) a SharePoint site, the site will first check with Central Admin (the farm) to enquire about this user's profile details. The farm grabs the account name and display name from Active Directory, but does not keep this synchronized.

Unless configured otherwise, end users in SharePoint do not have the ability to modify their own display name. And the best place to update this is to either:

1. Modify the farm user information list cache (via steps above), or
2. Set up User Profile Synchronization
