GRASP stands for General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns and describes guidelines for working out what objects are responsible for what areas of the application.

<!--endintro-->

The fundamentals of GRASP are the building blocks of Object-Oriented design. It is important that responsibilities in your application are assigned predictably and sensibly to achieve maximum extensibility and maintainability.

GRASP consists of a set of patterns and principles that describe different ways of constructing relationships between classes and objects.

| Creator              | A specific class is responsible for creating instances of specific other classes (e.g. a Factory Pattern)                           |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Information Expert   | Responsibilities are delegated to the class that holds the information required to handle that responsibility                       |
| ---                  | ---                                                                                                                                 |
| Controller           | System events are handled by a single "controller" class that delegates to other objects the work that needs to be done             |
| ---                  | ---                                                                                                                                 |
| Low Coupling         | Classes should have a low dependency on each other, have low impact if changed, and have high potential for reuse                   |
| ---                  | ---                                                                                                                                 |
| High Cohesion        | Objects should be created for a single set of focused responsibilities                                                              |
| ---                  | ---                                                                                                                                 |
| Polymorphism         | The variation in behaviour of a type of object is the responsibility of that type's implementation                                  |
| ---                  | ---                                                                                                                                 |
| Pure Fabrication     | Any class that does not represent a concept in the problem domain                                                                   |
| ---                  | ---                                                                                                                                 |
| Indirection          | The responsibility of mediation between two classes is handled by an intermediate object (e.g. a Controller in the MVC pattern)     |
| ---                  | ---                                                                                                                                 |
| Protected Variations | Variations in the behaviour of other objects is abstracted away from the dependent object by means of an interface and polymorphism |
| ---                  | ---                                                                                                                                 |

Tip: Visual Studio's Architecture tools can help you visualise your dependencies. A good structure will show calls flowing in one direction.
