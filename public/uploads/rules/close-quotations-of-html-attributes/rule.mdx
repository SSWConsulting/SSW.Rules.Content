Make sure there are equivalent closing quotations for HTML attributes. A small mistake of missing a quotation could lead to undesired results on a web page.

<!--endintro-->

```html
<div class="info>
```

::: bad
Figure: Bad code - Can you spot the missing quote? Code Auditor can
:::

```html
<div class="info">
```

::: good
Figure: Good code - All OK
:::

As you can see from the above example, just missing a quotation makes the whole layout of the text different. So be very careful that you make sure you have closed all opening quotations of attributes with equivalent closing quotations.

We have a program called [SSW Code Auditor](https://codeauditor.com) to check for this rule.
