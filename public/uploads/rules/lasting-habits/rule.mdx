It can be really hard to change your behavior and habits in order to improve your life. The best way to change your behavior is to start small by creating tiny habits.

The Tiny Habits method, developed by Dr. BJ Fogg, emphasizes starting with very small actions that are easy to do, which helps build momentum and eventually leads to lasting behavior change. The key to this approach is to link your new tiny habit to an existing habit, ensuring it fits seamlessly into your daily routine.

Use this simple template to create your tiny habits:

  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    After I **&#123;&#123; EXISTING HABIT &#125;&#125;**, I will **&#123;&#123; NEW TINY BEHAVIOUR &#125;&#125;**.
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

This formula helps you anchor the new behavior to something you already do regularly, making it more likely you'll follow through.

## Tips for new habits

* **Set a goal** - Think about what you want to improve.
  E.g. I want to drink more water
* **Anchor it** - Attach your new habit to a reliable and specific trigger in your daily routine. This ensures it fits into your day without requiring extra effort to remember.
  E.g. Pour my morning coffee
* **Start small** - The habit should be tiny, so its easy to complete and hard to skip.
  E.g. Drink a glass of water
* **Celebrate immediately** - Reinforce your habit by celebrating immediately after completing it. This helps create a positive association with the behavior.
  E.g. Give yourself a high five
* **Don't forget** - Initially, you might need a reminder.
  E.g. Set an alarm, ask your partner to remind you, put a sticky note in your bathroom

## Examples

  body={<>
    
* After I **brush my teeth**, I will **floss one tooth**
* After I **pour my morning coffee**, I will **drink a glass of water**
* After I **start the toaster**, I will **do 5 push-ups**

By starting with something small, you remove the barrier of feeling overwhelmed, making it easier to stay consistent. As these tiny habits become automatic, you can gradually expand on them, leading to significant and sustainable changes over time.
