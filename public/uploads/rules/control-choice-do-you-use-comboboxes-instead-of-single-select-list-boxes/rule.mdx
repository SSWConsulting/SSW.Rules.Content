seoDescription: Control your data entry experience by using ComboBoxes instead of
  single-select List Boxes.
title: Control Choice - Do you use ComboBoxes instead of single-select List Boxes?

ComboBoxes are better than List Boxes **for data entry** because:

* They occupy less screen space
* They are less trouble to scroll through, owing to the fact that you can afford to have more room for the list (as it's collapsed most of the time)
* As you can see in the figures below, using a combo also makes the required field indicator (\*) easier to see.

**Note: When are single-select list boxes OK?**

As mentioned before, there are exceptions to this rule. It would be hard to imagine the Include/Exclude boxes in the SQL Server Enterprise Manager's Server Registration Wizard being handled with ComboBoxes, for example.
