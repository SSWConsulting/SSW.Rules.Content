In Bing, if you are logged in to your work account, you can easily see your recent files!
The same works for your work colleagues.

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: '![Good Example: Bing - Find your files faster by just searching on Bing](/uploads/rules/the-best-way-to-find-recent-files/bing-recent-files.png)',

} } />


**Suggestion to Microsoft:** Put a checkbox "Show thumbnails" like Delve.

In a slower way, you can go to Delve to see this information with a different UI with big images.

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: '![Bad Example: Delve - Is harder to get to and the UI doesn\'t offer a summary view like Bing](/uploads/rules/the-best-way-to-find-recent-files/delve-recent-files.png)',
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />
