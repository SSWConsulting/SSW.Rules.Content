Pure Scrum dictates that the **Scrum Master** could be one of the developers on the team, but we find this is hard for a developer as he will be split between trying to do the work himself, while also ensuring that the Team still uses Scrum properly.

We find that a better option is to use a separate **Scrum Master** so his only responsibility on the project is to ensure Scrum is used well and the **Product Owner** is informed of any developments.
