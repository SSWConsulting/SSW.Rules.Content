It is a good idea to run a pre-migration check on the SharePoint 2007 before starting the migration process.

1. Check you have followed [Do you add stsadm to the environmental variables?](/do-you-add-stsadm-to-environmental-variables)
2. Open up **cmd** with Administrator privileges
3. Run the following command: \*\*stsadm –o preupgradecheck

** ![](/uploads/rules/do-you-do-a-pre-migration-check-on-the-sharepoint-2007-server/preupgradecheck.png)**
Figure 3 - Check the pre-migration report. The only thing that is allowed to fail is “FeatureInfo”. This is because a custom feature won’t migrate and developers need to create a build targeted for SharePoint 2010 \*\* 4. Save the HTML file that was generated and email it to your companies SharePoint Master. (Don’t print it as its very large) 5. Have the [SharePoint Master](/do-you-have-a-sharepoint-master) sign off on the pre-migration check and inform you if there are any site collections or content sources that are no longer needed and can be ignored for migration
