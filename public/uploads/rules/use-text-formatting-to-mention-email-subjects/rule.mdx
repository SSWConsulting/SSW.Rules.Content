Usually, when mentioning an email in a Microsoft Teams chat, the approach is straightforward, such as typing "email subject: Good morning."

<endOfIntro />

To make your messages more visually appealing, you can use "> &#123;&#123; MESSAGE &#125;&#125;" in Microsoft Teams chats to highlight your message as a quote. This works particularly well when you want to refer to an email subject, i.e:

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  captionStyle="badExample"
  caption={"Bad example - Mentioning an email without formatting"}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-text-formatting-to-mention-email-subjects/bad-example.png"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  captionStyle="goodExample"
  caption={"Good example - Mentioning an email using the \"> &#123;&#123; MESSAGE &#125;&#125;\" formatting"}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-text-formatting-to-mention-email-subjects/good-example.png"
/>


Try it now! Open a Microsoft Teams chat and type in “> This is an email subject” and press enter.
