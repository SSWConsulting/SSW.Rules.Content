In Scrum, meetings are time boxed. Team members should be well prepared in order to accomplish the meeting goals in time.

### Daily Scrum Meetings

This is time boxed to 15 mins. All members of the team should be well prepared by:

* Being ready on time
* (If your team is estimating tasks) Having their "Remaining hours" up-to-date – read
  [Do you update your tasks before the daily Scrum meeting?](/meeting-do-you-update-your-tasks-before-the-daily-scrum)
* Be ready to answer the 3 main questions: - What did you do yesterday? e.g. "Yesterday I did xxx" - What are you doing today? e.g. "Today I will do yyy" - Do you foresee any impediments or roadblocks? e.g. "I might hit a roadblock today because of xxx"

* Remember to say "Let's park that conversation for after the Daily Scrum". Major discussions are not to be conducted during the time boxed Scrum meeting.
* Being on the video call (especially for team members in different locations).

### Sprint Review Meetings

All members of the team must be well prepared by:

* Deploying the latest iteration of the product
* Being available **30 minutes** before the meeting
* Setting up and testing the technology in the room (ie. projector, TV, HDMI cable etc.) with a computer before the meeting starts
* Making sure remote members are connected via video call before the meeting starts
* Nominating in advance another member of the team to take notes from the presentation [(or using an AI scribe)](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/best-ai-tools/)
* Deciding, in advance, the order in which PBIs should be presented; priority, Sprint backlog order, logical order and minimizing presenter and presentation medium switching should be taken into account.
* Controlling the time spent on the PBI presentation

  * Practice the demo beforehand if needed to ensure a succinct delivery. This can be in the form of a pre-prepared video if desired
  * Inform the Product Owner what the main goal of the PBI is and tell if the team believe it was done or not
  * If the Product Owner previously saw what was done, ideally the member should just mention that and ask if the PBI is accepted
  * If the member needs to show something, show a couple of examples and ask if the Product Owner wants to see something else

### Sprint Retrospective Meetings

All members of the team must be well prepared by:

* Having all your tasks from the last Sprint closed
* Having your Sprint feedback ready in advance, so members don’t need to think about it during the meeting, saving time
* Being clear and pointing out issues that need further discussions

### Sprint Planning Meetings

All members of the team must be well prepared by:

* Having all bugs and PBIs up-to-date on the backlog
* Having all PBIs on the backlog “groomed” in order of priority (according to the Product Owner)
* Understanding all PBIs and the Product Owner’s priorities
* Being responsible on estimates
* Volunteering to work on PBIs and tasks, even if they are not related to your best skills – read [Do you encourage multi-skilled teams?](/the-team-do-you-encourage-multi-skilled-teams-by-leaving-your-comfort-zone)
