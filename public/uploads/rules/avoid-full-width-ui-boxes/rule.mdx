On large screens, full-width UI boxes can look awkward and reduce readability, especially when the content inside is just a short message.

While full-width is fine on mobile (where horizontal space is limited), desktop and tablet layouts need smarter width handling.

## Defining responsive box widths

Apply the following CSS width properties to keep your UI boxes clean and responsive:

```css
width: fit-content;
min-width: 40%;
max-width: 700px;
```

## ✅ Design advantages

* **Better readability** for both short and long messages

  * Short messages don't look oddly small (thanks to min-width)
  * Longer messages don't sprawl across the full page (thanks to max-width)
  * Boxes grow naturally with their content but remain visually consistent
* **Visually balanced** – avoids floating tiny boxes or massive full-width ones
* **Aligned design** when using multiple boxes on the same screen
* Works seamlessly with **responsive layouts**

So remember... just because you have the width, doesn't mean you should use it. Your UI will feel polished and intentional.
