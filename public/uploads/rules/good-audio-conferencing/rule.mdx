Whilst working remotely it is good practice to ensure you have a decent setup to have effective remote meetings. This includes:
  </>}
/>
* Good Microphone
* Camera
* Conferencing software like Teams or Zoom

It is always better to have complicated discussions over a call rather than just using instant messaging.

It is also good to **use your camera** so that people can see your body language to better aid in gauging your feelings on a particular topic.

Other good practices are to **use headphones**  and to  **keep your microphone on mute when not speaking** .

Also don't forget this is also important for mental health, maintaining regular communication with your friends and colleagues.
