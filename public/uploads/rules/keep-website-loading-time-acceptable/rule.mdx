You should use [Pingdom Website Speed Test](http://tools.pingdom.com/fpt/) to analyze the load speed of your websites and learn how to make them faster.

Then work to keep it under 3 MB:

| Rating       | Page Size                |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| ❌ **Unacceptable** | > 3 MB                    |
| 👍 **OK**           | 1.5 MB to 3 MB (apple.com is 1.5 MB) |
| ✅ **Good**         | < 1.5 MB                  |
| ⭐️ **Excellent**    | < 1 MB                    |
