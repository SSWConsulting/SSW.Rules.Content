<introEmbed
  body={<>
There are many scenarios where you need some extra space in a web page (HTML or Markdown). No matter which one you are at, CSS is the answer.
  </>}
/>
Sometimes the first thing that comes to the developer mind is to use the "break line" tag ``, or the [ASCII character codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) for "space" `&#160;` / `&nbsp;` to create these extra spaces. **It's wrong!**

CSS is the way to go. You can use both "margin" or "padding" CSS properties to get the result you want.

```html
<ul>
  <li>&#160;&#160;&#160;List item</li>
</ul>
```
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Figure: Bad example - Using the \"space\" ASCII character to create a padding on that list",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


```html
<ul>
  <li>List item</li>
</ul>



```
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Figure: Bad example - Using the `` tag to create a space at the bottom of that list",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />



<asideEmbed
  variant="info"
  body={<>
    **Note:** If you **cannot** use CSS to create some breathing space, using `&lt;br /&gt;` maybe acceptable as last resort for better readability.
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>


```css
ul {
  margin-bottom: 15px;
}
ul li {
  padding-left: 10px;
}
```
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "Figure: Good example - Using CSS to add a margin at the bottom of the list a the padding on the left side of each list item",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


**Tip:** You might be not familiar with editing a CSS file... In this case, contact a designer, they will be more than happy to help you.
