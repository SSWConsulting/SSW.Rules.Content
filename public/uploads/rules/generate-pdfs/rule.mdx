Some projects call for being able to export data as a PDF. In these instances, it's great to be able to fully generate the file in the back-end and then provide it for download.

As with most software problems, there's many ways to achieve the same end result, each with their pros and cons.

### Paid libraries

There are many paid .NET libraries available which can generate PDFs for you like:

- [PDFTron](https://www.pdftron.com)
- [Syncfusion](https://www.syncfusion.com/document-processing/pdf-framework/net-core/pdf-library)
- [IronPDF](https://ironpdf.com)

If the project has budget for a paid PDF solution, these are great and will get you generating PDFs quickly.

**Pros:**

✅ Mostly works out-of-the-box
✅ Potential for commercial support from the library developer

**Cons:**

❌ Project might not have the budget for such an option
❌ Is often closed source ([see more](/why-use-open-source))

### Free libraries

Unfortunately, the vast majority of libraries which can generate PDFs directly are paid. To get around this, the PDF generation function of a browser testing library can be used instead. Using this method, the desired content is rendered in a headless browser and that browser is then used to generate a PDF.

**Pros:**

✅ Free!
✅ [Open source](/why-use-open-source)
✅ Can easily reuse existing web layouts

**Cons:**

❌ Support is often limited
❌ May require more configuration to get working

### Example

One library which makes this really easy (and is free!) is [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/dotnet).

Generating a PDF here takes just a few lines, see the [demo](https://try.playwright.tech/?e=generate-pdf) and [docs](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/api/class-page#page-pdf) for more info.

```csharp
public async Task<byte[]> ExportView(string url, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    var playwright = await Playwright.CreateAsync();
    var browser = await playwright.Chromium.LaunchAsync();
    var page = await browser.NewPageAsync();
    await page.GotoAsync(url);
    if (cancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested) { return Array.Empty<byte>(); }

    return await page.PdfAsync(new PagePdfOptions { Format = "A4" });
}
```
