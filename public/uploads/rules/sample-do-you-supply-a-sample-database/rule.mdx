If you are shipping a product that makes use of a database backend, then you should also supply and option to automatically populate the database with some sample database. This is particularly important if you are offering your software as a trial license and need to have data in the database to show off your application's ground breaking functionality.

Tip: you can script your data in a sample database to a .sql file with a lot of INSERT statements and then use a product such as [SSW SQL Deploy](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/SQLDeploy) to manage the safe execution of your .sql file.
