If you want to deploy your App to China and you want to use a domain name to access it, ==**ICP filing is required**==. ICP requires some paperwork to prove the domain belongs to you.

ICP (Internet Content Provider) filing is for non-commercial websites that are purely informational and provide information free of charge. It shows as **浙 ICP 备 20009588 号**, **"浙"** represents Zhejiang.

**It typically includes the following:**

- The website owner must be a resident or enterprise of mainland China.
- The website owner needs to provide valid identification and contact information.
- The website's content must comply with the Chinese government's censorship standards and may not disseminate illegal or harmful information.
- The website needs to display the ICP filing number on the website for verification by users and government agencies.
