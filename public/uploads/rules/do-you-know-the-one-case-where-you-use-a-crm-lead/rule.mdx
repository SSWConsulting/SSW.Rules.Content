**Figure: There is only one scenario where you would use a lead**

It is better to have all your contacts in one place rather than split over 2 separate tables. Leads are not needed except as a data entry tool to help you link new contacts, companies, and opportunities. See [Quick Way to create an opportunity, contact and account in one step](/data-entry-do-you-know-the-quick-way-to-create-a-contact-account-and-opportunity-in-1-go).

The only legitimate use of leads is for completely unqualified data, e.g.

- You buy a contact database (too large to be able to contact each one of them to qualify)
