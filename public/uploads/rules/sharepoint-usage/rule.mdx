1. Page Usage


<imageEmbed

  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Access page usage from any page by clicking \"Analytics\"",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/sharepoint-usage/sharepoint-page-usage.jpg"
/>


2. Site Usage

Site owners can access global site usage reports:


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Access site level usage via \"Settings\" | \"Site Usage\"",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/sharepoint-usage/sharepoint-site-usage.jpg"
/>


3. Tenant Usage

This is by far the most interesting and import report. You need special (tenant-level) permissions to access those usage reports


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Access tenant level usage via \"Office 365 Admin Center\" | \"Reports\" | \"Usage\" | \"View More\" (under SharePoint section)",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/sharepoint-usage/sharepoint-tenant-usage.jpg"
/>
