Usage analytics is quite important - it allows you to identify popular and unused pages or sites, but also helps measuring users' engagement.

There are 3 places to check for Usage reports in SharePoint:

<endIntro />

1. Page Usage


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure='Access page usage from any page by clicking "Analytics"'
  src="/uploads/rules/sharepoint-usage/sharepoint-page-usage.jpg"
/>


2. Site Usage

Site owners can access global site usage reports:


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure='Access site level usage via "Settings" | "Site Usage"'
  src="/uploads/rules/sharepoint-usage/sharepoint-site-usage.jpg"
/>


3. Tenant Usage

This is by far the most interesting and import report. You need special (tenant-level) permissions to access those usage reports


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure='Access tenant level usage via "Office 365 Admin Center" | "Reports" | "Usage" | "View More" (under SharePoint section)'
  src="/uploads/rules/sharepoint-usage/sharepoint-tenant-usage.jpg"
/>

Now enjoy the full power of SharePoint usage analytics !
