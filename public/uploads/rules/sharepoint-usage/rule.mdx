1. Page Usage


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'Access page usage from any page by clicking "Analytics"',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/sharepoint-usage/sharepoint-page-usage.jpg"
/>

2. Site Usage

Site owners can access global site usage reports:


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'Access site level usage via "Settings" | "Site Usage"',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/sharepoint-usage/sharepoint-site-usage.jpg"
/>

3. Tenant Usage

This is by far the most interesting and import report. You need special (tenant-level) permissions to access those usage reports


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'Access tenant level usage via "Office 365 Admin Center" | "Reports" | "Usage" | "View More" (under SharePoint section)',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/sharepoint-usage/sharepoint-tenant-usage.jpg"
/>
