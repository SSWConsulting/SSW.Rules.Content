Usage analytics is quite important - it allows you to identify popular and unused pages or sites, but also helps measuring users' engagement.

There are 3 places to check for Usage reports in SharePoint:

<endIntro />

1. Page Usage


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure='Access page usage from any page by clicking \"Analytics\"'
  src="/uploads/rules/sharepoint-usage/sharepoint-page-usage.jpg"
/>


2. Site Usage

Site owners can access global site usage reports:


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure='Access site level usage via \"Settings\" | \"Site Usage\"'
  src="/uploads/rules/sharepoint-usage/sharepoint-site-usage.jpg"
/>


3. Tenant Usage

This is by far the most interesting and import report. You need special (tenant-level) permissions to access those usage reports


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure='Access tenant level usage via \"Office 365 Admin Center\" | \"Reports\" | \"Usage\" | \"View More\" (under SharePoint section)'
  src="/uploads/rules/sharepoint-usage/sharepoint-tenant-usage.jpg"
/>

Now enjoy the full power of SharePoint usage analytics !
