One of the annoying things with SharePoint document and page libraries is that users often accidentally leave [checked out files](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/check-out-check-in-or-discard-changes-to-files-in-a-sharepoint-library-7e2c12a9-a874-4393-9511-1378a700f6de), that prevents others from modifying them.

There are 2 ways to remind users of their "checked out files":

* **Solution A:** Use Powershell scripts (see [PNP.github.io sample](https://www.sharepointdiary.com/2017/06/sharepoint-online-get-all-checked-out-files-using-powershell.html#:~:text=Navigate%20to%20the%20document%20library,get%20all%20checked%20out%20documents))
* **Solution B:** Custom application report (Includes some low-code work) E.g. [SSW.Dory](https://sswdory.com/)

### Solution A. Powershell scripts

1. Create a new PowerShell Script

```powershell
#Config Variables
$SiteURL = "https://crescent.sharepoint.com/sites/marketing"
$CSVFilePath = "C:\Temp\CheckedOutFiles.csv"

#Connect to PnP Online
Connect-PnPOnline -Url $SiteURL -Credentials (Get-Credential)

#Get all document libraries
$CheckedOutFiles = @()
$DocumentLibraries = Get-PnPList | Where-Object {$_.BaseType -eq "DocumentLibrary" -and $_.Hidden -eq $False}

#Iterate through document libraries
ForEach ($List in $DocumentLibraries)
{
    Write-host "Processing Library:"$List.Title -f Yellow

    #Get All Checked out Files of the library
    $FilesCheckedOut = Get-PnPListItem -List $List -PageSize 500 | Where {$_["CheckoutUser"] -ne $Null}

    #Collect data from each checked-out file
    ForEach ($File in $FilesCheckedOut)
    {
        $CheckedOutFiles += [PSCustomObject][ordered]@{
            Library         = $List.Title
            FileName        = $File.FieldValues.FileLeafRef
            CheckedOutTo    = $File.FieldValues.CheckoutUser.LookupValue
            Location        = $File.FieldValues.FileRef
        }
    }
}
#Export Checked out Files data to CSV File
$CheckedOutFiles
$CheckedOutFiles | Export-Csv -Path $CSVFilePath -NoTypeInformation
```

To run the script against your entire tenant, see [PNP.github.io sample](https://www.sharepointdiary.com/2017/06/sharepoint-online-get-all-checked-out-files-using-powershell.html#:~:text=Navigate%20to%20the%20document%20library,get%20all%20checked%20out%20documents)

2. Run the PowerShell script

3. Go chase after the users.

### Solution B. Custom application report (Includes some low-code work)

To make reminding users easier, we have created a [Power Automate](https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/en-au/) flow called SSW.Dory that will find checked out files and send out a notification email to all the naughty people automatically every day.

    ## Hi Dave

You currently have the following pages **checked out in SharePoint**:

* &#123;&#123; LIST OF URLS &#125;&#125;

1. If you are no longer editing these files, **check them in!**
  Note: You should check in at least daily, as per rule [SSW.Rules | Do you confirm there is no checked out data?](/do-you-confirm-there-is-no-checked-out-data).
2. Reply to this email with something like:

  &gt; ‘Done - x files checked in’

**Note:** See all files you have checked out at &#123;&#123; LINK TO CHECKED OUT LIST &#125;&#125;
