How do you show a tooltip or a note to a Dynamics user?


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "How to show a tooltip like this in Dynamics?",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/use-emoji-on-dynamics-label/image002.jpg"
/>


### Option 1 - Description attribute

Advantages:

* Out of box feature. No customizations needed

Disadvantages:

* Not obvious to see - users are often unaware they can hover on the label to see the note


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "The out-of-box description attribute can be used as a tooltip. But it's not obvious to see",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/use-emoji-on-dynamics-label/screenshot-at-oct-28-11-17-04.png"
/>


### Option 2 - PCF control

Advantages:

* Flexibility - can customize any style or behaviour

Disadvantages:

* Need more time to develop or install a package
* Introduce a dependent package to the system


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Use a PCF control to show a note and link to a web page",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/use-emoji-on-dynamics-label/screenshot-at-oct-28-11-23-52.png"
/>


### Option 3 - Description field + Emoji (Recommended)

Add an emoji in the label to remind people to hover to see the tooltip.


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Add an emoji on the label to remind to people it's a tooltip",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/use-emoji-on-dynamics-label/screenshot-at-oct-28-11-29-40.png"
/>
