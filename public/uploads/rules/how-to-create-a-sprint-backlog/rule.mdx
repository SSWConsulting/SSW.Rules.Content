Prior to your meeting with the customer you should prepare. Get your [Sprint Planning](/what-happens-at-a-sprint-planning-meeting) (was Release Plan) email ready, so after the meeting you can adjust and promptly send it.
  </>}
/>
Learn how to create your Sprint backlog:

* On [Microsoft Docs - Assign backlog items to a Sprint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/backlogs/create-your-backlog?view=azure-devops&tabs=agile-process&WT.mc_id=DOP-MVP-33518)
* On [GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/quickstart)

Once the backlog is ready, you should [send the Sprint Forecast email to the client](/send-sprint-forecast-and-sprint-review-retro-emails-to-the-client).
