  body={<>
When hackers or security researchers find a vulnerability in your system, they need a way to tell you. If you don’t have a <security@yourcompany.com> email, they might give up or go public.

Your `security@` inbox is your first line of defense.
  </>}
/>
It helps with:

* Responsible disclosure from ethical hackers
* Bug bounty submissions
* Early warnings before public leaks

You don’t need a full bug bounty program to start. Just set up the email, publish it (e.g. in your [security.txt](https://securitytxt.org)), and monitor it.

Make sure it’s:

* Monitored by trusted staff (not just one person)
* Responded to quickly (aim for &lt; 48h)
* Part of your incident response process
