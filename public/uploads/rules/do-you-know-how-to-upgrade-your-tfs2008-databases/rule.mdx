Since [we recommend doing a "move based upgrade"](/do-you-know-your-migration-choices1), we don’t like the "in place upgrade" option, these are the steps:

1. Copy the TFS2008 backups to TFS2010 server (e.g. C:\TfsBackups)
2. Restore all the databases to TFS2010’s instance of SQL 2008
3. Install Team Foundation Server 2010
4. After the install has completed the Team Foundation Server Configuration Wizard will open
5. Select Upgrade | Start Wizard
