It's hard to keep track of your PPC spending in your head when constantly adjusting spends for multiple campaigns. For example, you might have multiple campaigns running on a weekly basis. You'll probably be adjusting campaign spending regularly to find what tactics work best - and this becomes a challenge to track.

The best way to keep track of the monthly spend is to hold a [monthly meeting where you review the important metrics](/monthly-stakeholder-video).

During the recording, add the following points to your content:

1. The spend for the last month
1. Clicks
1. Impressions
1. CTR (click through rate)
1. CPC (cost per converstion)
