seoDescription: When designing responsive websites, it's crucial to consider the appropriate
  content for each screen size. Bootstrap provides display classes, such as `.d-None`,
  to quickly and responsively toggle the display value of components, hiding or showing
  content accordingly.

When designing responsive websites, it's important to consider what content is appropriate for each screen size. Desktops might have large navigation areas and extra content in a sidebar, whereas the phone might focus on other content.

<endOfIntro />

By default, Bootstrap will wrap the columns and make them full width on phones. If you want to hide content rather than let it wrap you can use the `.d-none` class or one of the `.d-{sm,md,lg,xl}-none` classes for any responsive screen variation.

More information on [Display property - Quickly and responsively toggle the display value of components and more with our display utilities](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/display/#how-it-works).

Remove the title by adding the `.hidden-xs` class.

```html
<h1 class="d-xl-none">ASP.NET</h1>
```
