If you are creating and using Components, you’re already doing a great job. The next step is to move those commonly used components into a Component Library. The advantage of moving to a Component Library is the Components will be accessible by all your apps. Another advantage is Components can be shared with other makers to use in their apps. To create a Component library, go to:

**Apps | Component libraries | Create Component library**
