You have worked hard on the coding, got a "Test Pass" from the testers. Great! Now you have approval to deploy to production. Let's see some ways that allow for easy deployments.
  </>}

### Modern Projects

If you are using Entity Framework Code First migrations this can be handled within your pipeline.

  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Using EF Migrations within your pipeline to apply these changes automatically",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-deploying-is-so-easy/efmigrations.png"
/>


### Legacy Projects

With Visual Studio, deployment becomes easier and easier, you can choose different ways for different kinds of projects.

**Web Clients**

- Right-click "Publish" (recommended if you can directly connect)
  OR
- Right-click "Create Package"


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "For a web app it is just one click",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-deploying-is-so-easy/PublishWeb.jpg"
/>


**Rich Clients**

- Right-click "Publish" (recommended if you can use ClickOnce)
  OR
- Right-click "Create Setup" (Suggestion to Microsoft as menu doesn't exist)


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "For a Windows clients it is also just one click",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-deploying-is-so-easy/PublishRichClient.jpg"
/>


**Database**


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "For the Database it is... well one click is what you need to aim for",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-deploying-is-so-easy/PublishDatabase.jpg"
/>


Now all this works beautifully first time, when there is no existing database... and no existing data to worry about. Now you have a reason to read the rest of the rules :-)
