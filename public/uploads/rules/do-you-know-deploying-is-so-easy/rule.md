You have worked hard on the coding, got a "Test Pass" from the testers. Great! Now you have approval to deploy to production. Let's see some ways that allow for easy deployments.

### Modern Projects

If you are using Entity Framework Code First migrations this can be handled within your pipeline.

### Legacy Projects

With Visual Studio, deployment becomes easier and easier, you can choose different ways for different kinds of projects.

**Web Clients**

- Right-click "Publish" (recommended if you can directly connect)  
  OR
- Right-click "Create Package"

![Figure: For a web app it is just one click](PublishWeb.jpg)

**Rich Clients**

- Right-click "Publish" (recommended if you can use ClickOnce)  
  OR
- Right-click "Create Setup" (Suggestion to Microsoft as menu doesn't exist)

![Figure: For a Windows clients it is also just one click](PublishRichClient.jpg)

**Database**

Now all this works beautifully first time, when there is no existing database... and no existing data to worry about. Now you have a reason to read the rest of the rules :-)
