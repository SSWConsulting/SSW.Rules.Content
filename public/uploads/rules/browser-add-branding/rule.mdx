    **Tip:** You can also [change your browser theme color](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/personalize-microsoft-edge-with-built-in-theme-colors/m-p/2230250?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-33518) to match your branding. This is especially useful to differentiate multiple profiles in your browser.

## How to add a branded image to your new tab experience

Setting a different per Edge or Chrome profile background image is a great way to have some branding and quickly identify which profile you are using when opening the browser or a new tab.

1. Open your Edge or Chrome browser
2. If you are not in the new tab experience click the + button to open a new tab
3. Click on settings | Edit Background

<imageEmbed alt="Image" size="large" showBorder={true} figurePrefix="none" figure="Opening new tab settings in a Microsoft Edge browser" src="/uploads/rules/browser-add-branding/open-browser-settings.jpg" />

1. Click on "Upload Image", select the image you want to use and click "Open"
2. Click "Apply"
3. Uncheck "Change new background daily"

<imageEmbed alt="Image" size="large" showBorder={true} figurePrefix="none" figure="Where to make changes" src="/uploads/rules/browser-add-branding/select-background-image.jpg" />

1. Close the dialog box, note you might have to scroll back up to see the "Close" button

Now every time you open a new tab or the browser you will see your custom background image and immediately know which tab you are in without having to glance over to the small profile image.
