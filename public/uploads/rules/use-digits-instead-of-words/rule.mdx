Whenever writing numbers, it's generally a good idea to use numerals, especially for complicated numbers. Numerals are more easily noticed when a page is scanned by a user's eye.

For example:
<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    There are seventy three good reasons to do this.
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: 'Bad example - The number is spelled out',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
/>

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    There are 73 good reasons to do this.
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: 'Good example - This is easier to read and more noticeable',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
/>

<asideEmbed
  variant="info"
  body={<>
    Certain editorial guidelines suggest using numerals for numbers 10 and above, while numbers 9 and below should be written out. However, when it comes to web content, we generally prefer using numerals regardless.
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>
