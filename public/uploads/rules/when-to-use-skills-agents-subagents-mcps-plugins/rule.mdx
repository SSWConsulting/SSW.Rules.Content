AI coding tools like Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and OpenCode offer several ways to extend their capabilities - skills, custom agents, subagents, MCP servers, and plugins. Each solves a different problem, and picking the wrong one leads to unnecessary complexity or limitations. Knowing which mechanism to reach for saves time and keeps your setup maintainable.

## An AI Glossary

### Agent

Agents are what developers interact with, they take the necessary actions to achieve the users intended goal. By utilising the following tools, they can be enhanced for specific scenarios to be even more effective.

### Subagent

Subagents are isolated AI instances with their own context window, capable of running in parallel with other subagents from a primary agent. This reduces the fluff inside of the main conversation window, with the primary process only receiving summaries of results of the subagents.

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    **Use Case:** You ask an agent to research five competitors. Instead of going through each competitor sequentially, it can spawn five subagents that each research one in parallel, then the primary agent synthesizes the results into a single comparison. The win is speed and focus.

### AGENTS.md

AGENTS.md is a markdown file that is loaded at the start of every session, providing project context to the AI Agent.

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    **Use Case:** In a monorepo with React frontend and Python backend. Each directory has an AGENTS.md tells agents the local rules: "use pytest," "all routes need auth middleware." This allows the codebase-specific context to be injected into every conversation, improving consistency by eliminating the need for developers to repeat themselves.
  </>}

### Skill

Skills are reusable prompts that standardize how AI approach repeating tasks. Like AGENTS.md, skills are also markdown files, but their purpose is to be situationally invoked when relevant and be portable across codebases.

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    **Use Case:** A company has a specific way they like to perform security audits using AI. Rather than copy and pasting the promopt, we install the skill and instruct the agent to perform a security audit using the installed skill. The skill is injected into the agent's context, so the agent receives the same instruction every time.
  </>}

### MCP-Server

MCP servers are an external process that exposes tools and data via the open standard of [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro), allowing your AI agents to retrieve and work with data.

Use Case: You want Claude Code and Cursor to both query your internal Postgres database. One MCP server exposes the database, and any compatible agent can connect. Write once, use everywhere.

## The quick decision guide

Before diving into the details, use this flowchart to find the right mechanism:

* **Need live data from an external system?** ➡ MCP Server
* **Need to teach the AI a workflow or procedure?** ➡ Skill
* **Need project-wide conventions always in context?** ➡ AGENTS.md
* **Need parallel or isolated task execution?** ➡ Subagent
* **Need to package and share extensions with your team?** ➡ Plugin
* **Need production automation or CI/CD integration?** ➡ Agent SDK

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    `AGENTS.md` is the cross-platform convention for providing project context to most AI coding tools. However, some tools still use their own file
    
    * Claude Code uses `CLAUDE.md`
    * Cursor uses `.cursorrules`
    
    But the concept remains the same. This rule uses `AGENTS.md` as the general term.

## Understanding the differences

With how quickly these tools were introduced and adopted, things quickly get out of hand and the names of the tools are commonly confused with one another. It is important to distinguish the differences between each of them, so here are the key differences between some commonly confusioned tools.

### Skills vs MCP Servers

High level difference:

* Skills tell the AI what to do - they inject prompts, workflows, and domain specific knowledge
* MCP Servers give the AI access to data to help them do it - they connect AI agents to external systems

Structural difference:

* Skills are simply markdown files with some frontmatter. This makes them easily shared and lightweight. It's effectively a "portable set of instructions", which is intended to be reused.
* MCP servers are code. They expose tools for agents and the instructions on how to use those tools.

Skills and MCPs are complimentary to one another: A skill can instruct the AI to use tools exposed by an MCP server.

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    **Scenario:** You want the AI to create a GitHub issue with a specific format whenever it finds a bug.
    
    * \*\*Skills \*\*define the issue template, the labeling conventions, and the workflow steps
    * An MCP Server provides the connection to the GitHub API so the AI can actually create the issue

### Skills vs AGENTS.md

This is the most common source of confusion.

With Skills and AGENTS.md, both provide instructions to the AI, but they differntiate from one another in the way that they are loaded:

* **AGENTS.md** is always loaded - every token counts against your context window from the start
* **Skills** load on demand - only the name and description are loaded at startup (\~30-50 tokens each), with full instructions loading only when the skill is relevant

AGENTS.md defines rules and instructions to AI agents which are intended to be used for general agent tasks within a codebase.

Skills, on the other hand, define rules and insturctions on specific tasks, where agents might need more context and instructions. They save the user time by reducing the need for the rewrite the same prompts.

Whilst yes, you can just put all your “skills” in AGENTS.md, this introduces unnecessary token waste, not to mention leading to lower quality outputs as bloated AGENTS.md files can sometimes cause AI agents to ignore certain instructions.

### Agents vs subagents

Subagents (supported in Claude Code, Cursor, Open Code, etc.) run in their own context window. This means that:

* Heavy search results don't clutter your main conversation
* Multiple subagents can work in parallel
* You can restrict what tools a subagent has access to (e.g. read-only for reviewers)
* The main conversation only receives a summary of the work

So, you should use subagents when the task is self-contained, and does not require a back-and-forth with the user.

In tools that don't yet support subagents directly, custom agents with restricted tool access can serve a similar purpose.

## The extensibility spectrum

These mechanisms form a spectrum from simple to complex. Start simple and only add complexity when needed:

1. **AGENTS.md** - Static knowledge and conventions (start here)
2. **Skills** - Reusable, on-demand expertise with supporting files
3. **MCP Servers** - External tool and data source integration
4. **Custom agents / Subagents** - Isolated, specialized execution contexts
5. **Agent SDK** - Full programmatic agents for production systems

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    You can think of it like a software project:
    
    * **AGENTS.md** are your README and .env file - always-present configuration
    * **Skills** are your utility library - reusable, modular, loaded when needed
    * **Subagents** are your worker threads - isolated, parallel, focused execution
    * **MCP Servers** are your API integrations - connecting to external services

## Practical adoption strategy

There is no need for stress over selecting the perfect tool every ttime, they're all just optimizations for specific use cases anad do not have drastic consequences for choosing the wrong tool. As you continue to use them, it will become clearer as you do when specific tools make your AI assisted workflow easier.

Don't try to adopt everything at once. Instead, follow this progression to get comfortable with the tools available:

1. **Start with AGENTS.md** - Add your project conventions, build commands, and architecture overview
2. **Create skills for your top 3 repeated tasks** - Code reviews, commit messages, and planning are common first choices
3. **Configure MCP servers for external integrations** - Databases, GitHub, search APIs
4. **Build custom agents for specialized roles** - Read-only reviewers, parallel researchers, implementation planners
