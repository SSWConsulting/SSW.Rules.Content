AI coding tools like Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and OpenCode offer several ways to extend their capabilities - skills, custom agents, subagents, MCP servers, and plugins. Each solves a different problem, and picking the wrong one leads to unnecessary complexity or limitations. Knowing which mechanism to reach for saves time and keeps your setup maintainable.

### MCP-Server

## The quick decision guide

Before diving into the details, use this flowchart to find the right mechanism:

* **Need live data from an external system?** ➡ MCP Server
* **Need to teach the AI a workflow or procedure?** ➡ Skill
* **Need project-wide conventions always in context?** ➡ AGENTS.md
* **Need parallel or isolated task execution?** ➡ Subagent
* **Need to package and share extensions with your team?** ➡ Plugin
* **Need production automation or CI/CD integration?** ➡ Agent SDK

**Note:** `AGENTS.md` is the cross-platform convention for providing project context to AI coding tools. Some tools use their own file - Claude Code uses `CLAUDE.md`, Cursor uses `.cursorrules` - but the concept is the same. This rule uses `AGENTS.md` as the general term.

## What each mechanism does

| Mechanism        | What it is                                                                                                                  | When to use it                                                                                | Supported by                                    |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **AGENTS.md**    | A markdown file loaded at the start of every session providing project context                                              | Project conventions, coding standards, and context that should always be available            | Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor, OpenCode          |
| **Skill**        | A folder with a skill file and optional supporting files following the [Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io) | Reusable workflows, domain expertise, slash commands like `/deploy` or `/review`              | Claude Code, Copilot, OpenCode, Cursor          |
| **Subagent**     | An isolated AI instance with its own context window                                                                         | Parallel research, heavy tasks you want out of your main context, enforcing tool restrictions | Claude Code, OpenCode                           |
| **Custom agent** | A reusable, task-specific agent definition with defined tools and instructions                                              | Specialized roles like code reviewers or planners that get invoked across workflows           | Claude Code, Copilot, OpenCode                  |
| **MCP Server**   | An external process that exposes tools and data via the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)           | Connecting to databases, APIs, and SaaS platforms (GitHub, Jira, Slack, etc.)                 | Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor, OpenCode, ChatGPT |
| **Plugin**       | A distribution package that bundles skills, agents, MCP servers, and other extensions together                              | Sharing a collection of extensions with your team or the community                            | Claude Code                                     |

## Understanding the differences

All of these things are new, and terms can be commonly confused with one another….

### Skills vs MCP Servers

This is the most common source of confusion. The key distinction:

* **Skills teach the AI *what to do*** - they inject prompts, workflows, and domain knowledge
* **MCP Servers give the AI *access to data*** - they connect to external systems

They are complementary. A skill can instruct the AI to use tools exposed by an MCP server.

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    **Scenario:** You want the AI to create a GitHub issue with a specific format whenever it finds a bug.
    
    * **Skill** = defines the issue template, the labeling conventions, and the workflow steps
    * **MCP Server** = provides the connection to the GitHub API so the AI can actually create the issue
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Skills and MCP servers working together - the skill defines the workflow, the MCP server provides the integration"
  style="greybox"
/>

### Skills vs AGENTS.md

Both provide instructions to the AI, but they load differently:

* **AGENTS.md** is always loaded - every token counts against your context window from the start
* **Skills** load on demand - only the name and description are loaded at startup (\~30-50 tokens each), with full instructions loading only when the skill is relevant

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    An AGENTS.md with 5,000 tokens of instructions for code reviews, deployment procedures, commit message formats, and PR templates - all loaded even when you're just asking a quick question.
  </>}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure="Putting everything in AGENTS.md wastes context tokens on instructions that aren't needed for every task"
/>

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    A lean AGENTS.md with project conventions (500 tokens), plus separate skills for `/review`, `/deploy`, `/commit`, and `/pr-template` that only load when invoked.
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="AGENTS.md for always-on context, skills for task-specific workflows"
/>

### Subagents vs doing everything in the main conversation

Subagents (supported in Claude Code and OpenCode) run in their own context window. This means:

* Heavy search results don't clutter your main conversation
* Multiple subagents can work in parallel (up to 10 concurrently)
* You can restrict what tools a subagent has access to (e.g. read-only for reviewers)
* The main conversation only receives a summary of the work

Use subagents when the task is self-contained and doesn't need back-and-forth with the user. In tools that don't support subagents directly, custom agents with restricted tool access can serve a similar purpose.

### Plugins vs standalone configuration

Plugins are a **packaging format**, not a capability. A plugin bundles skills, agents, MCP servers, and other extensions into a single installable package. Currently this is most mature in Claude Code, but the concept of packaging extensions for distribution applies broadly. If you're just customizing your own setup, configure each mechanism directly. Use plugins when you need to distribute a collection of extensions to others.

## The extensibility spectrum

These mechanisms form a spectrum from simple to complex. Start simple and only add complexity when needed:

1. **AGENTS.md** - Static knowledge and conventions (start here)
2. **Skills** - Reusable, on-demand expertise with supporting files
3. **MCP Servers** - External tool and data source integration
4. **Custom agents / Subagents** - Isolated, specialized execution contexts
5. **Plugins** - Shareable packages bundling all of the above
6. **Agent SDK** - Full programmatic agents for production systems

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    Think of it like a software project:
    
    * **AGENTS.md** = your README and .env file - always-present configuration
    * **Skills** = your utility library - reusable, modular, loaded when needed
    * **Subagents** = your worker threads - isolated, parallel, focused execution
    * **MCP Servers** = your API integrations - connecting to external services
    * **Plugins** = your npm packages - distributable bundles for sharing
  </>}

## Practical adoption strategy

Don't try to adopt everything at once. Follow this progression:

1. **Start with AGENTS.md** - Add your project conventions, build commands, and architecture overview
2. **Create skills for your top 3 repeated tasks** - Code reviews, commit messages, and planning are common first choices
3. **Configure MCP servers for external integrations** - Databases, GitHub, search APIs
4. **Build custom agents for specialized roles** - Read-only reviewers, parallel researchers, implementation planners
5. **Package into plugins for team sharing** - When your setup is mature and others would benefit
