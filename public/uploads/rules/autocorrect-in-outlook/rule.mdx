title: Do you use Autocorrect in Outlook to insert links?
type: rule
uri: autocorrect-in-outlook

You just received another email from a client asking for your company's Terms and Conditions. Instead of navigating through your files or searching your website to find the link, wouldn't it be more efficient to simply type a shorthand code like `#`+ `T` and have Outlook automatically insert the URL for you?

This is where the Autocorrect feature in Outlook can become a huge time-saver.

<endOfIntro />

## Why Use Autocorrect for URLs?

* **Efficiency**: It saves time by eliminating the need to find and copy-paste URLs
* **Consistency**: It ensures that everyone is using the same URL and reduces the risk of errors

## How to Set It Up

1. Open Outlook and go to **File | Options | Mail | Spelling and Autocorrect**
2. Click `Autocorrect Options` and add your shorthand and URL link.
