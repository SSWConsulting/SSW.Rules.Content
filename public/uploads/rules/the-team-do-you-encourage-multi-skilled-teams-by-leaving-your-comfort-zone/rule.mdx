When selecting their tasks, team members should be looking to extend their skills. Scrum encourages multi-skilled workers, rather than having testers, back-end developers, designers etc. In other words, all team members should be able to help completing any task.
This does not imply that everyone is a guru in everything; no doubt some people are especially skilled in a specific area, but team members work together and should be learning new skills from each other.

During task generation and estimation in Sprint Planning, choose something new and ask someone experienced in that area to have a subtask to help you.

This is to make the team multi-skilled and reduce dependencies on individuals.
