Every day businesses get hounded by sales calls; recruiters, cleaners, printer cartridges - the list goes on. When you receive a call for 'the manager' or 'for Tim', that sounds suspicious, ask the caller to provide the full name of the person they are seeking. If they can't, or don't provide a believable context, screen the call.
