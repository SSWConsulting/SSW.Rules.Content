There are different ways of sending newsletters using the Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2016:

* Campaigns
* Quick Campaigns
* Mail Merge on Marketing Lists

This rule will show you how to send a newsletter using the last method, the mail merge.

By default, Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2016 does not come with good functionality on inserting custom unsubscribe links to your newsletters - that's why we are going to look at how to add a custom unsubscribe link in each email.

<endIntro />

Prerequisites:

* [Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2016 for Microsoft Office Outlook (Outlook client)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=50370&WT.mc_id=DX-MVP-33518) is installed and set up
* Microsoft Outlook is running and set up

### Option 1 (recommended)

Basic coding knowledge (VBA) required - you will have to configure the macro that generates and inserts your custom unsubscribe link. If you don't feel comfortable doing this, have a look at Option 2 below.

Depending on how many contacts you are going to send the newsletter to, you should think about setting up a VM or using an external provider for sending the emails.

1. Go to **Main | Marketing | Marketing Lists**

/>

2. Open the Marketing List you want to send the newsletter to by clicking on it (you should be using a dynamic list)
3. Go to **... | Mail Merge on List Members** (in the menu bar)

  figurePrefix="none"
  figure="Click the ellipsis button to reveal the Mail Merge option"
  src="/uploads/rules/how-to-send-newsletter-in-microsoft-crm-2016/Go-To-Mail-Merge-On-List-Members.jpg"
/>

4. Select Email as the mail merge type, choose your starting document, (optional) select data fields to use, and download the .docx

  figurePrefix="none"
  figure="This is an example of a configuration to start with"
  src="/uploads/rules/how-to-send-newsletter-in-microsoft-crm-2016/Download-Mail-Merge-Template.jpg"
/>

5. Open the document in Word and follow the instructions in the document to start the Mail Merge

/>

6. Exclude contacts and press **OK**

  figure="Choose the recipients for your mail merge and proceed"
  src="/uploads/rules/how-to-send-newsletter-in-microsoft-crm-2016/Select-Contacts.jpg"
/>

7. Copy and paste your newsletter from Internet Explorer to Word (IE because it seems to not break the style)

   For a nicer editing experience (especially with HTML newsletter), switch to the Web Layout view by clicking  **View | (Views) | Web Layout** in the ribbon bar.
8. If necessary, go to  **File | (Info) | Convert** to update the Word document to the newest version - this will solve styling issues while not breaking the mail merge

  figure="Convert the mail merge document to the newest version"
  src="/uploads/rules/how-to-send-newsletter-in-microsoft-crm-2016/Convert-Document.jpg"
/>

9. Modify and run the following macro to replace the word "UNSUBSCRIBE" in the newsletter with a custom hyperlink.

   For help on adding a macro to Word see the [Microsoft Office Support website](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-or-run-a-macro-c6b99036-905c-49a6-818a-dfb98b7c3c9c).

```vbnet
Sub InsertNewsletterLink()
'
' InsertNewsletterLink Macro
'
'
'Finds and adds a hyperlink where the UNSUBSCRIBE tag is placed
    With Selection.Find
        .Forward = False
        .Wrap = wdFindAsk
        .Text = "UNSUBSCRIBE"
        .MatchWholeWord = True
        .Execute
    End With
    ActiveDocument.Fields.Add Range:=Selection.Range, Type:=wdFieldHyperlink

'Switch to alternative view so we can modify the content of the hyperlink "manually"
    ActiveDocument.ActiveWindow.View.ShowFieldCodes = _
     Not ActiveDocument.ActiveWindow.View.ShowFieldCodes

    With Selection.Find
        .Forward = True
        .Wrap = wdFindStop
        .Text = "HYPERLINK"
        .MatchWholeWord = True
        .Execute
    End With

    Selection.InsertAfter " ""https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/NETUG/Unsubscribe.aspx?email=<<email>>"

    'Insert word mail merge fields on <<email>> and <<contact>>

    With Selection.Find
        .Forward = False
        .Wrap = wdFindStop
        .Text = "<<email>>"
        .MatchWholeWord = True
        .Execute
    End With

    ActiveDocument.Fields.Add Range:=Selection.Range, Type:=wdFieldMergeField, Text:="EMAIL"

    Selection.InsertAfter "&id=<<contact>>"

    With Selection.Find
        .Forward = False
        .Wrap = wdFindStop
        .Text = "<<contact>>"
        .MatchWholeWord = True
        .Execute
    End With

    ActiveDocument.Fields.Add Range:=Selection.Range, Type:=wdFieldMergeField, Text:="CONTACT"
    Selection.InsertAfter """"

    Selection.MoveRight Unit:=wdCharacter, Count:=1

'Remove the additional MERGEFORMATs

For counter = 0 To 1
    With Selection.Find
        .Forward = False
        .Wrap = wdFindStop
        .Text = "\* MERGEFORMAT "
        .MatchWholeWord = True
        .Execute
    End With
    Selection.Delete
    Next counter

'Switch back to normal view so we can change what the hyperlink looks like to the user
    ActiveDocument.ActiveWindow.View.ShowFieldCodes = _
     Not ActiveDocument.ActiveWindow.View.ShowFieldCodes

    With Selection.Find
        .Forward = True
        .Wrap = wdFindStop
        .Text = "Error! Hyperlink reference not valid."
        .MatchWholeWord = True
        .Execute
    End With
    Selection.Text = "UNSUBSCRIBE"
    Selection.Font.Bold = False

    Selection.Font.Underline = wdUnderlineSingle

    Selection.HomeKey Unit:=wdStory

End Sub
```

10. Follow the steps in the mail merge sidebar on the right-hand side of Word

    If you are using mail merge fields, like the contact names, you should preview your message for some contacts.

  src="/uploads/rules/how-to-send-newsletter-in-microsoft-crm-2016/Verify-Changes.jpg"
/>

11. Send the mail merge newsletter to the email address property of every contact by selecting the following

/>


### Option 2

You don't need any coding knowledge here - but this means you will have to generate your custom unsubscribe link manually and copy and paste it into the mail merge document. Make sure to [set it up it correctly](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/912679) before copying.
