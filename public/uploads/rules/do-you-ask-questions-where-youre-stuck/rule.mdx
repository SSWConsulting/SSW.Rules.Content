Many developers sit with their faces to the screen, isolating themselves from the team, trying to solve a problem on their own. If you're stuck on one bug for more than an hour, ask someone to help.

No-one gets a medal for solving a problem on their own in 2 days, when it could've been solved by 2 people in a couple of hours.

The [Daily Scrum](/methodology-do-you-do-daily-scrums-aka-stand-up-meetings) is a good time to bring up any ongoing issues or sticking points if you haven't already.
