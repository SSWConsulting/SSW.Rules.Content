When your product owner asks for an architecture Diagram on you project choosing the right software can easily lead to decision paralysis. You've got the choice between Draw\.io, Excalidraw, Miro,  Diagrams.net, Visio(God forbid), Lucid chart and many other options. In this rule we'll cover off the when, where, and why you would choose Mermaid diagrams.

<endIntro />

## What is Mermaid?

Mermaid is a Javascript based charting tool inspired by markdown.

The major advantage Mermaid has over tools like Draw\.io is that Mermaid diagram formats are supported by a number of Markdown parsing engines like GitHub, and [TinaCMS](https://tina.io/blog/mermaid-tina-progress). To put it simply **you can embed Mermaid diagrams directly in GitHub issues and contributors can edit them.**

## Why Mermaid excels at collaboration

### AI Friendly

Because mermaid diagrams are text based, they can quickly be churned by AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude Desktop, making it quicker and easier to draft changes.

### Team collaboration

Visual tools like Draw\.io or Excalidraw are excellent for whiteboarding and quick brainstorming. However, they start to fall down when diagrams need to be:

* Maintained over time
* Reviewed in pull requests
* Kept in sync with code

Mermaid shines in these scenarios.
