When your product owner asks for an architecture Diagram on you project choosing the right software can easily lead to decision paralysis. You've got the choice between Draw\.io, Excalidraw, Miro,  Diagrams.net, Visio, Lucid chart and many other options. In this rule we'll cover off why Mermaid diagrams might be preferable.

<endIntro />

## What is Mermaid?

Mermaid is a Javascript, node based charting tool inspired by markdown. It's supported by a number of Markdown parsing engines like GitHub, and [TinaCMS](https://tina.io/blog/mermaid-tina-progress).

## AI Friendly

Because mermaid diagrams are text based, they can quickly be churned by AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude Desktop, making it quicker and easier to draft changes.

## When to use Mermaid

* Documentation sites: Because Mermaid diagrams can be stored in markdown it's good to use them on for documentation pages that are updated frequently.

It's best to use mermaid during the prototyping phase when settling on a project in a public forum like GitHub. 

Why Mermaid excels at collaboration



Visual tools like Draw\.io or Excalidraw are excellent for whiteboarding and quick brainstorming. However, they start to fall down when diagrams need to be:

* Maintained over time
* Reviewed in pull requests
* Kept in sync with code
