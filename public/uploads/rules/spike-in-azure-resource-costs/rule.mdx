title: Do you proactively notify about expected spikes in Azure Resource costs?
type: rule
uri: spike-in-azure-resource-costs
---

Always inform stakeholders in advance if you anticipate a significant increase in Azure resource costs. This proactive communication is crucial for budget planning and avoiding unexpected expenses.

<endOfIntro />

## Why This Matters

1. **Budget Management:** Sudden spikes in costs can disrupt budget allocations and financial planning.
2. **Transparency:** Keeping stakeholders informed fosters trust and transparency in operations.
3. **Planning:** Advance notice allows for better resource allocation and potential cost optimization strategies.

## How to Implement

* **Communicate Early:** As soon as a potential cost increase is identified, communicate this to relevant stakeholders.
* **Provide Details:** Include information about the cause of the spike, expected duration, and any steps being taken to mitigate costs.

### Scenarios


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    A team needs to perform a bulk update on millions of records in an Azure Cosmos DB instance, a task that requires scaling up the throughput units substantially. They proceed without notifying anyone, assuming the cost would be minimal as usual. However, the intensive usage for a week leads to an unexpectedly high bill, causing budgetary concerns and dissatisfaction among stakeholders.

  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    Before running a large-scale data migration on Azure SQL Database, which is expected to significantly increase DTU (Database Transaction Unit) consumption for a week, the team calculates the expected cost increase. They inform the finance and management teams, providing a detailed report on the reasons for the spike, the benefits of the migration, and potential cost-saving measures.

Then send an email (as per the template below)

    ## Hi &#123;&#123; SpendMaster aka SysAdmins &#125;&#125;

I need to perform &#123;&#123; TASK &#125;&#125; on &#123;&#123; PROJECT NAME &#125;&#125;. I know that this will cost more than our usual amount for Azure. I expect the process to run for &#123;&#123; X &#125;&#125; days.

I have calculated this cost to be &#123;&#123; $$ &#125;&#125;.
