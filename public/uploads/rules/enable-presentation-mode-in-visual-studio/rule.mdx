When presenting the screen to an audience it is important to alter a few things for the best possible experience for the audience. The most import thing is to increase your font to **make the content more visible**.

Here are some of the applications where it is especially important:

* Visual Studio
* Text Editor
* Command Prompt

## Visual Studio

1. Make your font bigger. This is probably rule number one. There's nothing worse than not being able to see the excellent code you're trying to demo.

   * Increase the font of the Text Editor from 10 to 14 or more.
   * Increase the font of your Environment from 9 to 12 or more.

2. Remove any distracting panes or other windows. These usually just get in the way. If you really need them, make sure they're set to pin mode, so they hide when not in use.
3. Most importantly, you can have all these things done for you at the click of a button by using the [presentation mode extension by Mads](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/use-visual-studio-in-presentation-mode/?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-33518).

  } }

    figure: "Good example - Presentation mode creates a full alternative profile so you can adjust font sizes across the whole UI",

  } }

  } }

## Text Editor

Change font size in your text editor. Zoom in from 100% to 200%.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: "Bad example - Small font size",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/enable-presentation-mode-in-visual-studio/text-editor-bad.png"
/>

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good example - Good font size",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/enable-presentation-mode-in-visual-studio/text-editor-good.png"
/>

## Command Prompt

And don't forget to change your command prompt as well. Increase the font size from 12 to 16 or more.

  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: "Bad example - Command prompts are hard to read",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/enable-presentation-mode-in-visual-studio/cmd-bad.png"
/>

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good example - Font size for command prompt should be about twice as much as by default",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/enable-presentation-mode-in-visual-studio/cmd-good.png"
/>
