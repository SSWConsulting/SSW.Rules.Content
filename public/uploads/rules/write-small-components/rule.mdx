The Single Responsibility Principle is a well understood, and well-accepted tenet of good code design. It states that a class should do one thing, and do it well - The same applies to Components used with Frameworks such as Angular, React, Vue and Blazor.

When designing components, keep them small, modular and reusable. For example, if you have a menu, put it into a menu component, donâ€™t put it in your app component.
