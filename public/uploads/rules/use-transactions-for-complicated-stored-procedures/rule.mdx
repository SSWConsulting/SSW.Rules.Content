<introEmbed
  body={<>
A transaction means an atomic operation, it assures that all operations within the transaction are successful, if not, the transaction will cancel all operations and roll back to the original state of the database, that means no dirty data and mess exists in the database, so if a stored procedure has many steps, and each step has relation with other steps, it is strongly recommended that you encapsulate the procedure in a transaction.
