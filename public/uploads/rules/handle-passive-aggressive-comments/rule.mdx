### Steps to Handle Passive Aggressive Comments

#### 1. Acknowledge the Subtext

Begin by reflecting what you sense in their comment. Use phrases like:

* "It sounds like there’s more to that."
* "It seems like you’re holding something back."
* "It sounds like there’s more for me to understand about what you just said."

These responses show that you recognize a deeper concern without escalating the situation.

#### 2. Seek Clarification

Ask, “Should I read into that?”

* This invites the person to clarify their statement
* Even if they respond “no,” they’ll be more mindful in future conversations knowing that their comments won’t be ignored

#### 3. Address Feelings Directly

Kindly and genuinely ask, “How are you feeling?”

* This can create a safe space for the other person to express what’s really bothering them
* Often, addressing emotions leads to a more productive discussion and resolution

#### What Not to Do

Avoid explicitly calling out the behavior as passive aggressive, such as saying, “That was a bit passive aggressive.” This approach is likely to put the other person on the defensive and escalate tension.

**✅ Figure: Good Example - Responding kindly with, “It sounds like there’s more to that. How are you feeling about the deadlines?” opens the door to a constructive conversation**  

### Why This Works

1. **De-escalation:** Thoughtful responses defuse tension and avoid accusations
2. **Clarity:** Direct questions about feelings or intent help uncover the real issue
3. **Resolution:** Focusing on emotions often resolves misunderstandings and fosters better communication

By responding with empathy and professionalism, you can handle passive aggressive comments effectively, maintain a positive atmosphere, and build stronger relationships within your team.
