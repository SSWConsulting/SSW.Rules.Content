Historically, it’s been the convention to refer to users as ‘he’ in technical documentation. This is obviously outdated and sexist – users may not be a "he". It’s more common now to see "he/she" used, but this is clunky and could also still be considered as misgendering non-binary people.

The best pronoun to use is "they". It’s simple and elegant and doesn't exclude anyone.

    This new feature is important if the user runs long tasks. At the end of a process, ==he== will know the amount of time spent. Now that the status bar shows the time taken and progress percentage, ==he== can evaluate how long it will take beforehand. Then ==he== can go get a cup of coffee.
