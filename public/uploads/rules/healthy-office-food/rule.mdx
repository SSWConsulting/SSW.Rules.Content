1. Buy them fresh fruit and veggies every Monday - you can set up an automation to remind someone to buy it, or set up a subscription with a delivery service.

2. Don't encourage drinking - there are healthier ways to bond at events

3. Free lunches - aim to keep them healthy

4. Healthy options for birthday celebrations like a cake made from fruit
