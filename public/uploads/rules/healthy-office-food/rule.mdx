Everyone knows the benefits of a workforce that eats well and has a healthier lifestyle. They are better engaged, take fewer sick days, and are generally happier.

Developers often spend long hours at a desk, which can make it easy to fall into unhealthy habits like skipping exercise, not getting enough sleep, or relying on convenience food. When people aren’t looking after their health, it becomes harder to focus, stay energised, and perform at their best.

Encouraging healthier habits helps create a more productive and positive team.

There are many ways to help keep your team healthy 🍎!

* **Fresh snacks** - Provide fresh fruit and veggies every Monday. Set up a reminder or a delivery subscription so it happens automatically
* **Better bonding:** Avoid encouraging drinking. There are plenty of healthier ways to connect and have fun at team events
* **Healthy treats:** Offer free lunches, aiming for balanced and nutritious options
* **Smart celebrations:** Choose healthier birthday options, like fruit platters or fruit-based cakes
