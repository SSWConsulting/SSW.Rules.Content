When working with SSRS reports, you need to have the right type of project otherwise it will be difficult for a developer, to create new reports or update existing ones.

If you have some reports and want to check them into source control, if you add them to project that is not a report project, your reports will not open in the design/preview view (allowing to see the DataSource and DataSets). They will open in the XML view (which is not pretty to work with).

  } }

To open the reports in the right view you will need to:

1. Be sure that you VS has the tool/extensions Microsoft Reporting Services Projects installed, go to **Tools** | **Extensions and Updates** | **Online**, and search for services

    shouldDisplay: true
  } }

/>

* In [SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) for Visual Studio website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssdt/download-sql-server-data-tools-ssdt?view=sql-server-2017&WT.mc_id=DP-MVP-33518) you will find all the instructions to install the tool via Marketplace or SSDT standalone installer.

2. Create the project selecting **Business Intelligence** | **Reporting Services** | **Report Server Project**

3. Add existing reports and create your new DataSource (based in the information on your Report Portal)
