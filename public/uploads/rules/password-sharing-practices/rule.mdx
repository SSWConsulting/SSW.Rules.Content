Often an organization needs to share a password to a 3rd party. Perhaps a client or a vendor require a password. There are a few ways that this could be achieved but some are less secure than others.

- **Email** - sending an email containing the username and password for anything is the worst thing you can do. If that email falls into the wrong hands it is immediately compromised.

    shouldDisplay: true
  } }

/>

- **Email + SMS** - Sending a username via email and the password in SMS is slightly better but is still a little bit risky as both services could be compromised and often people sync their messages to their PC, so this is still too risky.

    figure: "Bad example - Email + SMS is better but still insecure",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }

/>

- **OneTime Sharing via a 3rd party** - You could use a service such as [OneTimeSecret](https://onetimesecret.com) to share the secret details. This is better but there is still a small risk that the 3rd party website could be compromised and your details are still leaked.

    shouldDisplay: true
  } }

/>

- **Share via your Enterprise Password Manager** - This is the most secure way to share a secret with an external 3rd party. With products such as Keeper Enterprise all of your passwords remain safe inside your own vault and can generate a link or a QR code to send to your client.
