If you are using Microsoft Dynamics 365 Online as your CRM solution, you might have noticed that it syncs some Microsoft Entra ID - formerly Azure Active Directory fields automatically.
  </>}
/>
Dynamics 365 Online leverages Entra ID fields to import information to users, e.g.:

1. First Name;
2. Last Name;
3. Job Title;
4. Address

And, depending on your configuration, these Entra ID fields might be coming directly from on-premises Active Directory (AD), which means that any changes made in AD will go through all the way to Dynamics 365 Online!

That also means that if you change a field in Dynamics 365 directly, that might get overwritten by the value in Entra ID in the next sync (usually every 15-30 minutes), so make sure you make that field read-only so users are not led to error.

Recommended fields to keep as read-only in Dynamics 365:

1. Username;
2. Title (Job Title);
3. Address

You can find more information on official Microsoft documentation: [Microsoft Entra ID attributes that are synced to Dynamics 365 / CDS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/hybrid/connect/reference-connect-sync-attributes-synchronized#dynamics-crm?WT.mc_id=DX-MVP-33518).
