Sometimes you will need to send a new version for an email. This often is due to 2 main reasons:

* You **received substantial feedback** about the email you've sent that requires a new version
* You realized you've **made a mistake** and want to send an updated version of an email
  </>}
/>
Having an entire new version of an email is important as it:

* Ensures that you understood feedback and incorporated it immediately
* Cleans up the email thread history to only have relevant content

  body={<>
    **Note:** Not every feedback will need a v2. Some may be in the form of:

* Hints for what could be better for next time, in which case all that's required is you take the feedback on board
* Changes or clarifications to the content, that can act as the latest version of the thread, without needing a re-send
  </>}

## How to structure and send a v2

Send the v2 email as if v1 never happened (same for v3, v4, etc). Make sure the first (or previous) version is **not** part of the email history.

1. Open your v1 email in Sent Items
2. Reply to All
3. Delete the whole v1 from the thread, including:
   * The previous email headings (From:, To:, Cc:, Bcc, Subject:, etc.)
   * Your signature
   * The words "RE:" from the subject only in the cases where first email was **not** a reply
4. If the email is a reply, then [keep the email history](/do-you-keep-the-history-of-an-email) leading up to your original email
5. Write the v2
6. Include (v2 - &#123;&#123; REASON &#125;&#125;) on the first line of the email body
   * The reason should include a summary of what was changed
   * If additional versions of an email is needed:
     * Repeat steps 1-3
     * Add a new v3, v4, v5 above the previous version with the reason for the new update

**Note:** Having a history of each new version can help people to understand what has been changed with each iteration.

    **Warning:** Do not add "v2" to the subject as we want to keep the thread.

    **Note:** In Outlook, there is an option to use the 'Resend This Message' button from the toolbar. This [used to be the standard practice](https://www.youtube.com/embed/SUo_hOCubeo), however currently it should be avoided as it breaks the thread.

  shouldDisplay: true
} } />

    **Note:** If all the feedback you received is incorporated into the new version, there is no need for an additional done email. However, if you've got other tasks in the feedback, it may be necessary to reply 'done' to those separated from the content of your v2.

## What about appointments?

For appointments, the procedure is different, see [do you explain why you've updated or deleted an appointment?](/explain-deleted-or-modified-appointments)
