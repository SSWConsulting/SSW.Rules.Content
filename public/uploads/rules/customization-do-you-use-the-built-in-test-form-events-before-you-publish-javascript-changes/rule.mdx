title: Customization - Do you use the built-in test form events before you publish
  JavaScript changes?

Generally you will add Javascript to the form to give client side validation.

<endOfIntro />

Given JavaScript is difficult to debug and doesn't get precompiled this can save a lot of time rather than re-publishing all the form changes and having to reload and refresh the forms manually.
These events can be trigged using the Preview menu from the form customization environment.
