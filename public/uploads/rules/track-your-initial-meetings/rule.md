To ensure clarity and consistency in our calendar invites, please follow the naming conventions below when scheduling meetings:

* For an Initial meetings, include **“Initial Meeting”** in the subject line
* For a Specification Review, include **“Spec Review”** in the subject line

This helps everyone quickly identify the purpose of the meeting, improves calendar visibility, and supports accurate reporting.

The Appointment should also be tracked (without regarding) in Dynamics 365 so that this information is readily available and reportable.

**Important: In Dynamics 365 (Outlook add-in), set the “Regarding” field to an opportunity, not an account.**

The idea behind it is that Power BI can then show the time elapsed between each sales milestone.
