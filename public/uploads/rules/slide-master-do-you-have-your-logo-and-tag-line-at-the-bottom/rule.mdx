seoDescription: Enhance your brand's presence by adding a logo and tagline to the
  Slide Master for consistent branding across all slides.
title: Slide Master - Do you have your logo and tag line at the bottom?

Add your logo and tagline for branding purposes. The tagline concept is to use a catchphrase that will sum up the tone of a brand and to reinforce the audience's memory of your company/product.

Neither of these elements is intended to distract, so they are placed subtly in the footer of the slide. It is present, but the influence is tiny and your audience's focus will remain squarely on the content.

### How to do it

Adding the tagline and logo in the Slide Master will replicate it automatically across all slides. The master will also dictate the size and font of text present on all slides. Once you've added your logo to the slide master and you're happy with the size and positioning, you can save your changes by clicking **Slide Master | Close Master View** in the navigation bar.
