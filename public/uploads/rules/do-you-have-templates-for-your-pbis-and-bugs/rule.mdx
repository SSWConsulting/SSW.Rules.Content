Bugs are often hard enough to resolve but when they don't detail how to reproduce the bug, or what the expected behaviour is, it wastes a lot of time and gets frustrating for the developers. Detail in a bug report is key to your teams effectiveness and success. This is not limited to bug reports, for example PBIs can be missing Acceptance Criteria.

In Azure DevOps, a great way to ensure you capture all the information required is through templates for your work items. Templates allow you to guide users through all the required info in a clear and concise manner, ensuring you will always have clean and detailed steps to reproduce a bug.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure="Bad example – This new bug template doesn’t make it obvious how the team likes their steps to repro"
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-have-templates-for-your-pbis-and-bugs/templates for pbis and bugs - bad example.png"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Good example – This new bug template guides the user to fill in the steps to repro in an ordered list and even prompts them to fill in what they expected to happen (and what actually happened)"
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-have-templates-for-your-pbis-and-bugs/templates for pbis and bugs - good example.png"
/>


Setting this up is pretty easy:

1. First you need to customize the template for a work item type
   
<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure="Customizing a bug work item"
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-have-templates-for-your-pbis-and-bugs/templates for pbis and bugs - customise.png"
/>


2. Choose the form control to edit
   
<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure="Set the default value for the Repro Steps field (Tip: use HTML)"
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-have-templates-for-your-pbis-and-bugs/templates for pbis and bugs - customise default value.png"
/>


3. Save Template
