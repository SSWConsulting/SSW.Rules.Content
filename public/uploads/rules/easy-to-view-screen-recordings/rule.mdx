Most developers like to set up their screen efficiently – often that means small fonts, visible bookmark bars and a huge amount of browser tabs and taskbar items. While this is great for efficiency, it is not very good for recordings or presentations, and the clutter should be removed.

Before recording your screen reduce visual noise by:

* **Removing unnecessary tabs** - Open the tab in its own window
* **Avoiding small fonts** - Zoom in to 125% by holding Ctrl and scrolling up on the mouse wheel. If you're using a 4K or large monitor, consider zooming further or increasing your display scale to 175% or 200% instead of the recommended 150%
* **Hiding the bookmark bar**

  * Windows shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + b
  * Mac shortcut: Cmd + Shift + b
