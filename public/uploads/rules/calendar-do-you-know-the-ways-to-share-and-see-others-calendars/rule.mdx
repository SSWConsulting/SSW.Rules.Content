While working in a team, there are three ways of seeing others' or team calendars.

### Option 1: Using Outlook Calendar Permissions - See a person's calendar (Recommended)

You can share your Outlook calendar with another person or a group in Outlook. This option is useful when you want to share your personal calendar with others.

See [Calendar Permissions - Do you share your calendars?](/calendar-do-you-allow-full-access-to-calendar-admins) [](/calendar-do-you-allow-full-access-to-calendar-admins) for step-by-step instructions on how to share your calendar or see another person's shared calendar.

  } }

/>


### Option 2: Using Dynamics 365 CRM Appointments - See everyone's tracked appointments

If you do not have access to someone’s calendar, you can see their tracked appointments in Dynamics 365 | Appointments.

This can keep track of important things like client work and leave. See [Scheduling - Do you know how to book developers for a project?](/scheduling-do-you-know-how-to-book-developers-for-a-project) on how to add a booking to CRM Service Calendar.

**Note:** This will only show appointments that have been tracked in CRM.
