Have you ever read a document and wondered if it was still relevent - or who last touched it?

Nothing undermines confidence faster than uncertainty about a document's freshness or ownership. When readers can't tell who last updated a rule or when it was last changed, they're left guessing whether to trust or ignore it.

Clear authorship and update information turn that uncertainty into accountability.

## The Checklist to Better Document Ownership

* Add a visible _"Last Updated by [Name]"_ to every rule or document (Tip: Even better, link this to the updated Git commit)
* Include clearly the date when the document was last updated (Tip: Include a time-zone for less chance of confusion)
* For open-source documentation, add a link allowing to the source of the document, so that users can easily make edits
* Provide a link to the full change history, showing all commits to the source file (e.g. "See History on GitHub")
