Normally, you don't need to check the history very often. If you do need sometimes, then get it from Visual SourceSafe (VSS) - Save much space for Team Foundation Server (TFS). For example, we have a about 7G VSS history database, and we may only need a small bit of them every 3 months, so what's the point of coping about 7G file when we only need one line of code?

But there are also some considerations that you may want to migrate the history:

* If the history of source changes will be checked very often, so you can check the old history with the recent together via TFS
* You are going to decommission the old VSS completely. Say you don't want to keep the old VSS database, and then it will be necessary to keep the information somewhere
* If the project is very active, then it will be worthy to migrate the history because your developers may need them every day
