What happens when you leave all the testing to the end of the Sprint? You find things that are not **_done_** and you have no time before the **Sprint Review** to fix them.

It is preferable to conduct a **Smoke Test** to make sure that you are comfortable demoing the unit of work you just finished to the customer. One way to do this is to create a Coded UI test for each of the Stories as part of your Definition of Done (DoD) that runs through the functionality you have built.

In this scenario the “ **test please** ” with the customer happens outside of the current Sprint.

If you are doing **Scrum** then you should have a **User Story** fleshed out with a set of **Acceptance Criteria** . These **Acceptance Criteria** are agreed with the **Product Owner** before **The Team** committed to the story, and define what the **Product Owner** will accept as complete. This makes it relatively easy to create some automated tests that test for these **Acceptance Criteria** and help your **Sprint Review** go as smoothly as possible.

Any changes found during **the Sprint Review** get added to the **Product Backlog** to be prioritised by the **Product Owner** .
