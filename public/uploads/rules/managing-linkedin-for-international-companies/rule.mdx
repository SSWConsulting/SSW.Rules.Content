A common marketing challenge for international companies is managing social media content in different languages for a diverse audience.

LinkedIn offers many ways to customize your company's posts for audiences all over the world. One of these options is to create posts for a specific audience group based on their location and language and more.

## Benefits of targeted, multilingual content

Here are a few valuable benefits of doing this:

✅ **Growth** – You can grow your audience in a single LinkedIn Page as opposed to starting from zero every time you add a new office location! <br>
✅ **Reach** – As your audience grows and so does your engagement, you will be able to reach more people and businesses <br>
✅ **Employment** – You will be able to advertise all the roles you are hiring for, locally and internationally, if this is your case <br>
✅ **Scaling up** – If your business is growing, you will be able to manage your LinkedIn presence under a single page and your business will look bigger as it grows!

## Why create targeted posts in different languages?

LinkedIn is extremely popular in North America, Europe and Asia. Having a multilingual profile can increase your online visibility and help reach existing and new clients and partners in these locations, which are also the largest and fastest-growing economies.

## Considerations to keep in mind

When creating a multilingual LinkedIn Company page, some key elements to keep in mind are:

* Make sure your services/products are suitable for the new audience you are targeting your content to as all markets will have their own individualities
* Ensure you are communicating the same message in all languages, and nothing is getting lost in translation
* You will need to invest in research to find out how your new audience is consuming content so you can adapt to that

## LinkedIn targeted posts in practice

### 1. Targeted Posts

Here is how you can create Targeted Company Posts:

1. On the “All Pages” or “Home” tab of your Super or Content admin view, draft your post

    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/managing-linkedin-for-international-companies/linkedin-post-how-to.png"
/>

2. As the default setting is “Anyone”, you can adjust the privacy settings by clicking on the 🌏 dropdown & selecting the correct audience for your post

  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'For a targeted company post, you would select “Targeted audience”',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}

/>

  🗒️ For comment settings, click “Anyone” at the bottom of the “Create a post" window – select your preferred settings (Anyone or No one) & click save to apply your changes.

3. Add your preferred targeting criteria on the Target audience settings Page. ⚠️Targeted posts must target a minimum of 300 Page Followers
   **Note:** You can add up to 150 different locations!

  }}

  }}

/>

4. Click the ‘Save’ button and you are all ready to post!

### 2. New language for your company’s About

Here is how you can add new languages to your LinkedIn company page:

1. On your company page, click on ‘Edit Page’
   **Note:** you will need to have admin access to be able to do this
2. On the left column, scroll down and you will see ‘Manage languages’

  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'If you have a multilingual business, you can select the different languages your clients may speak in this section on LinkedIn',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/managing-linkedin-for-international-companies/multilingual-pages-on-linkedin.png"
/>

3. Then you can add a tagline and a description. Please note that LinkedIn does not offer all languages in the world, so you need to verify if the needed language is covered by LinkedIn 🌐
4. After adding that information, you can choose your default language and your LinkedIn company page will be ready to reach new markets! 💥
