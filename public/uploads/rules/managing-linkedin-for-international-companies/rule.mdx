## Benefits of targeted, multilingual content

Here are a few valuable benefits of doing this:

✅ **Growth** – You can grow your audience in a single LinkedIn Page as opposed to starting from zero every time you add a new office location! 
✅ **Reach** – As your audience grows and so does your engagement, you will be able to reach more people and businesses 
✅ **Employment** – You will be able to advertise all the roles you are hiring for, locally and internationally, if this is your case 
✅ **Scaling up** – If your business is growing, you will be able to manage your LinkedIn presence under a single page and your business will look bigger as it grows!

## Why create targeted posts in different languages?

LinkedIn is extremely popular in North America, Europe and Asia. Having a multilingual profile can increase your online visibility and help reach existing and new clients and partners in these locations, which are also the largest and fastest-growing economies.

## Considerations to keep in mind

When creating a multilingual LinkedIn Company page, some key elements to keep in mind are:

* Make sure your services/products are suitable for the new audience you are targeting your content to as all markets will have their own individualities
* Ensure you are communicating the same message in all languages, and nothing is getting lost in translation
* You will need to invest in research to find out how your new audience is consuming content so you can adapt to that

## LinkedIn targeted posts in practice

### 1. Targeted Posts

Here is how you can create Targeted Company Posts:

1. On the “All Pages” or “Home” tab of your Super or Content admin view, draft your post

3. Then you can add a tagline and a description. Please note that LinkedIn does not offer all languages in the world, so you need to verify if the needed language is covered by LinkedIn 🌐
4. After adding that information, you can choose your default language and your LinkedIn company page will be ready to reach new markets! 💥
