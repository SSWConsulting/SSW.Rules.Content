All company receptionists should install SkypePOP on your PC.

This will enable you to get Dynamics CRM contact popups on incoming calls, for example:

1. Bob Northwind calls you
2. His CRM contact will open up in your browser (by default before you pickup)
3. You now know exactly what you last talked about (by looking at the recent Activities and Opportunities)

There is one limitation to SkypePOP - forwarded calls won't give you useful information, as SkypePOP will show you the contact details of the person forwarding the call, not the external client. That's why we recommend using SkypePOP the following way:

<endOfIntro />

Only receptionists should have SkypePOP installed.

1. An incoming call is taken by the receptionist

2. The CRM contact pops up (or a "new contact" form if the number is not already in your CRM):

/>


3. Send Email

  captionText={"This email will be created – send it to the person you are forwarding the call to"}

/>


4. Inform the person the call is being transferred to that you have sent him an email with the CRM Contact

5. Wow! No one has to open the CRM manually anymore

5. Configure the **Dynamics CRM** settings to something similar to this:


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  captionStyle="default"
  captionText={"These are the default SkypePOP settings"}
  src="/uploads/rules/how-to-install-skypepop/50.jpg"
/>


6. Open Skype for Business

7. Review the **SkypePOP - Skype for Business** settings


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  captionStyle="default"
  captionText={"These are the default Skype for Business settings"}
  src="/uploads/rules/how-to-install-skypepop/2016-11-18_16-44-59.jpg"
/>


8. Ensure both Dynamics CRM and Skype for Business are connected by clicking on the tray icon


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  captionStyle="default"
  captionText={"Check that you are properly connected - blue is success"}
  src="/uploads/rules/how-to-install-skypepop/2016-11-18_16-47-00.jpg"
/>


The SkypePOP demo license will stop working after 5 hours or 5 calls

**Tip:** Reduce the time used by quitting SkypePOP - you do that by right clicking | Exit on the tray icon

9. Restart your PC

10. Test with SNOM phone to verify SkypePOP is working correctly
