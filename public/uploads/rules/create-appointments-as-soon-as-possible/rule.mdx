A lot of people talk about appointments and plan to do it later. E.g. you’re at the dentist and they give you a card with your next visit’s time written on it. People take the card and plan to enter it into their calendar later.

A better way is to stop, pull out your phone, and enter it immediately before leaving the dentist.

Similarly, you might be on the phone with a client and arrange a date and plan to enter it in later. A better way is to say “Hang on a second while I shoot you an appointment for the time.”

Locking in time as soon as possible is a big efficiency gain, and helps to avoid any possible mistakes or double bookings.
