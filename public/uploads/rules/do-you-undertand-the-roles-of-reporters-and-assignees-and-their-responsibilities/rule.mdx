The Reporter is the person requesting the work, will answer any questions on it, review it if required and accept (Close) it once Done or Not Done.  The Reporter must respond to questions from the Assignee to keep the workflow going and not hold the Assignee up allowing the Assignee to work efficiently on the right things in a visible way.

The Assignee is the person currently assigned to the task and is responsible for taking it through the workflow to Done or Not Done. The Assignee must maintain the current priority, status and due date (when used) so the Reporter, and anyone else interested or watching, are kept informed efficiently providing complete visibility.
