If you call a client or team member, and for some reason they do not attend your call, then leave a message to ensure a response.

The advantages of leaving messages when your call is unanswered:

- They will know who called and be able to return your call
- If your message is urgent, they may return your call straight away (even though they're busy)

<endIntro />

Your messages must contain:

- Your first name and last name
- Purpose of calling
- Your contact number

Create a sense of urgency by giving them explicit time frames when you are available.

**❌ Figure: Bad Example - lacking in communication details, reason for calling and sense of urgency**

  body={<>
    "Hi Ms. Emma, this is Alvin Shen from SSW. I am calling to follow up our meeting yesterday about your company website. Please return my call on 02 9953 3000. The best time to reach me is between 9 and 11am today, or between 3 and 5pm tomorrow. My number again is 02 9953 3000. Thank you."

**✅ Figure: Good Example - This communicates important contact details, a reason for calling and implies a response is needed in the next day or so**  

You may want to confirm the voice message with an email.
