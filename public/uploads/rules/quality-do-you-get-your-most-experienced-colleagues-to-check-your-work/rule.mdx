It never hurts to get the advice of your colleagues, and getting advice from someone who's been doing what you're doing for a while will always teach you something new and improve the quality of your work.

For development, as your application starts to develop into a usable entity, make sure you get your Chief Architect (or equivalent) to have a look at what you're doing and weigh in with their advice.

You can do this through either a [test please](/conduct-a-test-please-internally-and-then-with-the-client) on an individual piece of work, or a [code review](/rules-to-better-architecture-and-code-review) for the entire project.
