Typically, when encountering undesirable behavior, the usual approach involves providing direct feedback. However, there are occasions when a more effective method can benefit both the individual and their immediate supervisor.

<endOfIntro />

An option is to request an "off the record" conversation with the manager, during which you can share your observations about the employee they oversee. You can suggest that if they agree, they could address the matter with the person in question.

This approach helps the manager develop their observation skills while also safeguarding the employee from appearing unfavorable or facing repercussions from their superior. If the employee accepts the feedback and demonstrates improved actions in subsequent meetings, you can then publicly commend them during the retrospective.
