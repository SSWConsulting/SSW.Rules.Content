The Scrum team needs a place to gather for all the Scrum ceremonies. This room should have useful information on the wall to help the team work more efficiently. We recommend having the following:

* [Task Board](/task-board) (to show current work in progress)
* [The 8 Steps to Scrum PDF](/uploads/rules/do-you-have-a-war-room-summary/8StepstoScrum.pdf) (to show how we work)
* [The 3 Steps to a PBI PDF](/uploads/rules/do-you-have-a-war-room-summary/3StepsToAPBI.pdf) (to know the lifecycle of a PBI)
* [Product Roadmap](/do-you-have-a-product-roadmap) (to let everyone know the large future priorities)
* [Definition of Done - aka Done Criteria or DoD](/definition-of-done) (the quality that is being adhered to)
