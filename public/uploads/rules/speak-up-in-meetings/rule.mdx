## 1. **Before** the meeting

### Prepare beforehand

Before the meeting, take a few minutes to mentally prepare. Remind yourself that your input is valuable. Go over the agenda, anticipate discussion points, and think of areas where you can contribute. A confident mindset will make speaking up easier.

### Get support from a colleague

If you’re hesitant, having an ally in the meeting can help. Coordinate with a trusted colleague beforehand to support each other. They can prompt you to share your thoughts or reinforce your points.

## 2. **During** the meeting

### Speak early

Start with small contributions. Instead of waiting for the perfect moment, comment on something simple, like agreeing with a point or adding a brief observation. This gets you comfortable participating early, reducing the anxiety of speaking later.

### Use your colleagues

Engage with your colleagues' ideas by building on them. If someone makes a great point, acknowledge it and add your perspective. This makes speaking up feel more natural and collaborative rather than confrontational.

Senior team members should also make an effort to engage juniors by providing them an opportunity to voice their thoughts and opinion.

### Ask questions

You don't always need to have an answer - asking a good question is just as valuable. Thoughtful questions can drive discussion and show that you're engaged. This is an easy way to contribute without feeling the pressure to provide solutions.

### Summarize

Regularly summarizing key points from a discussion ensures everyone is on the same page and prevents misunderstandings. Paraphrasing what has been said should be a consistent habit, as it enhances clarity and reinforces shared understanding throughout the conversation.

### Have a backchannel with a colleague

If you're unsure about a question you want to ask, send it to a colleague via via a messaging platform first e.g. Teams chat. This can help refine your question and boost confidence before speaking up.

## 3. **After** the meeting

### Do a Retro

Have a quick huddle with your colleagues and ask for feedback. They will be able to tell you the things you did great, and any areas where you might be able to improve. A retro is one of the best ways to learn and grow, so use that awesome tool.

### Practice speaking up regularly

Like any skill, speaking up in meetings gets easier with practice. Start by contributing in smaller meetings or informal discussions. Over time, your confidence will grow, making it second nature to speak up in larger settings.

By implementing these simple techniques, you’ll be able to participate more confidently in meetings and ensure your ideas are heard and valued.
