Some good examples of things to tweet about:

* One week before an event, tweet about the event to raise awareness
* One day before an event, tweet about the event and what you are talking about
* On the day of the event, check-in on foursquare when you arrive (gives people a nice map)
* When something good happens to you. E.g. You beat your boss in an arm wrestle
* Tweet before and after installing new software or after an upgrade. E.g:

  * Installing #SharePoint for the first time
  * \#SharePoint install done - found a great guide to follow here: mysharepointsite.com
