It is very common to come up with ways to filter data.

As an example, you could do it like this:

```sql
ClientSearch.aspx?Client.ClientID='ssw'&Client.CoName='S'
```

**Figure: Filtering Data**

This allows you to easily extract fields and values, but it only works for the fields you hard code. You could get around it by writing complex code to build a SQL query or ignore the ones that don't match.

But this gives exact matches. E.g.:

```sql
ClientID=ssw
```

What if you want to give the ability to allow the user to be able to use a like. E.g.:

```sql
ClientID like '%ssw%'
```

Well then I could add something like:

```sql
ClientSearch.aspx?Client.ClientID=ssw&Client.ClientID.SearchMode=OR
```

But why do this when a WHERE clause in SQL can do all this. E.g.:

```sql
ClientSearch.aspx?Where=Client.ClientID%20like%20'%ssw%'
```

The PROS for do this are:

* Quicker development time.
* SQL is very powerful - say I want to JOIN another table in the WHERE, I could use an IN statement and do a sub query - no extra code by the developer.
* Matches HTML syntax (named value pair) and as a developer you can get it easy. E.g.:

```cs
Request.QueryString("Where")
```

The Cons:

* It shows the database schema to the users - users maybe should not see the structure of the database.
* Security - the where clause could show data we don't want users to see.
* Got to add a little extra code to avoidÂ [SQL injection](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_injection.asp).
