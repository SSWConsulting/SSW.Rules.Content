It is important that while you're upgrading, nobody can check in. Any check-ins after you backup your database will be lost.

To make sure that nobody can change anything during the upgrade, follow these steps.
  </>}
/>
a. Send out an email notifying everyone TFS will be unavailable for the upgrade period

b. Make sure nobody can check in files:

c. Open the TFS Administration Console on the server.

d. Navigate to Application Tier / Team Project Collections.

e. For each Team Project Collection, select it, and click "Stop Collection". Enter a useful message (this will be displayed to users trying to connect from Visual Studio) and click "Stop":

    preset: "default",
    figure: "Stop each Team Project Collection",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }

    figure: "All Team Project Collections are stopped",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/disable-connections-tfs2015-migration/all team project.png"
/>

f. In Visual Studio, confirm you can no longer connect to TFS


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Visual Studio shows the message that you entered when you stopped the Team Project Collection",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/disable-connections-tfs2015-migration/visual studio.png"
/>
