### TODO: MattW - [View GitHub issue](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Rules.Content/issues/1390)

If you use Azure websites and VisualStudio.com you can set up continuously deployment in 5 minutes.

<endIntro />

If you are using TFS 2012 on premise, or are not using Windows Azure websites, follow the steps below to configure continuous deployment.

As you can see, there are a lot of steps and you will need at least a day to get it all right.
