title: Do you include URLs in "Done" tasks and emails?

Always include the relevant URL to your emails, like when you want to request or just made a change to a webpage or document. This way people can easily check the details of the tasks. This is especially important for ["Done" emails](/reply-done-and-delete-the-email).

If you are using a task tracking system like **Azure DevOps**, **GitHub**, or Jira, also include the link to the PBI/Issue/task/PR for extra information.

## Ensure changes are live

Before closing a PBI/Issue and declaring a task 'done' with a link, ensure that your changes are live and accessible for verification.

### Scenario: PR waiting for approval

Done - Changes will be on ssw&#46;com&#46;au/rules/dones-is-your-inbox-a-task-list-only

  </>}
  figurePrefix="ok"
  figure="OK example - Changes are not live yet, but people are aware and have the links"
/>


### Scenario: PR is approved and merged


<boxEmbed

## Ensure others have permissions

It is a common problem where someone CC'd will not have permissions to see a file and the sender knows this. You should still add the link but inform the recipient.

### Scenario: Recipient doesn't have permissions

  body={<>
    Done - onedrive&#46;live.com/file-name.xls
  </>}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure="Bad example - Link is included but recipient won't be able to open it, potentially generating more emails"
/>



<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    (link for reference - you don't have permissions)

Done - onedrive&#46;live.com/file-name.xls
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Good example - Link is included and people are aware of permission issues"
/>
