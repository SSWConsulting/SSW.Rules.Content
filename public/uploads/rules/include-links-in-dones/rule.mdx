title: Do you include URLs in "Done" tasks and emails?

Always include the relevant URL to your emails, like when you want to request or just made a change to a webpage or document. This way people can easily check the details of the tasks. This is especially important for ["Done" emails](/reply-done-and-delete-the-email).

If you are using a task tracking system like **Azure DevOps**, **GitHub**, or Jira, also include the link to the PBI/Issue/task/PR for extra information.

## Ensure changes are live

Before closing a PBI/Issue and declaring a task 'done' with a link, ensure that your changes are live and accessible for verification.

### Scenario: PR waiting for approval

  body={<>
    Done - ssw&#46;com&#46;au/rules/dones-is-your-inbox-a-task-list-only
  </>}
  captionStyle="badExample"
  captionText={"Bad example - Link is included but changes are not live yet"}
/>



<boxEmbed

    Done - github&#46;com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Rules&#46;Content/pull/0001

  </>}
  captionStyle="badExample"
  captionText={"Bad example - Using the PR link instead of the final page link"}
/>



<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    (PR waiting for approval - github&#46;com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Rules.Content/pull/0001)

Done - Changes will be on ssw&#46;com&#46;au/rules/dones-is-your-inbox-a-task-list-only

  </>}
  captionStyle="okExample"
  captionText={"OK example - Changes are not live yet, but people are aware and have the links"}
/>


### Scenario: PR is approved and merged


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    Done - ssw&#46;com&#46;au/rules/dones-is-your-inbox-a-task-list-only
  </>}
  captionStyle="goodExample"
  captionText={"Good example - Final link is included and changes are live to be checked"}
/>


## Ensure others have permissions

It is a common problem where someone CC'd will not have permissions to see a file and the sender knows this. You should still add the link but inform the recipient.

### Scenario: Recipient doesn't have permissions


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    Done - onedrive&#46;live.com/file-name.xls
  </>}
  captionStyle="badExample"
  captionText={"Bad example - Link is included but recipient won't be able to open it, potentially generating more emails"}
/>



<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    (link for reference - you don't have permissions)

Done - onedrive&#46;live.com/file-name.xls
  </>}
  captionStyle="goodExample"
  captionText={"Good example - Link is included and people are aware of permission issues"}
/>
