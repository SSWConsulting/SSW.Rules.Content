seoDescription: Avoid repeating elements in your content to promote clear communication
  and maintainable writing practices, as excessive repetition can hinder comprehension
  and create visual clutter.
title: Do you follow DRY and avoid repeated elements in content?
type: rule
uri: avoid-repetition

Clear communication is essential for success, and especially helpful in professional or technical contexts. You should make your content more visually interesting and easier to scan quickly.

    DRY, which stands for "don’t repeat yourself", is a principle of software development that aims at reducing the repetition of patterns and code duplication in favor of abstractions and avoiding redundancy.

**Lists** are great to make text easier to digest. Emojis make it even easier to consume when a lot of information is present. By using them you can enhance the communication experience. But when repeated excessively, they can become a hindrance rather than a help.

## Words

This is especially valid for words in lists, but also applies to [different types of content](/avoid-using-unnecessary-words).

For lists, you should **keep only the part that is unique** in each list item.

## Emojis

When there are multiple items listed, it can be challenging to distinguish between them quickly, leading to confusion and miscommunication. If the same emoji is repeated multiple times within a list, it can create visual clutter and make the list more difficult to read.

When creating a list that includes emojis, **avoid repeating the same emoji** 3 or more times within a list. Instead, add the emoji to an "introductory sentence" or "lead-in sentence". This helps keep the content concise, readable, and consistent, thus making it easier to scan the list and understand the benefits and drawbacks.
