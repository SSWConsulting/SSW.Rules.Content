    DRY, which stands for "don’t repeat yourself", is a principle of software development that aims at reducing the repetition of patterns and code duplication in favor of abstractions and avoiding redundancy.

**Lists** are great to make text easier to digest. Emojis make it even easier to consume when a lot of information is present. By using them you can enhance the communication experience. But when repeated excessively, they can become a hindrance rather than a help.

## Words

This is especially valid for words in lists, but also applies to [different types of content](/avoid-using-unnecessary-words).

For lists, you should **keep only the part that is unique** in each list item.

  }}
/>
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: 'Good example – No repeated words by using the DRY principle',
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


## Emojis

When there are multiple items listed, it can be challenging to distinguish between them quickly, leading to confusion and miscommunication. If the same emoji is repeated multiple times within a list, it can create visual clutter and make the list more difficult to read.

When creating a list that includes emojis, **avoid repeating the same emoji** 3 or more times within a list. Instead, add the emoji to an "introductory sentence" or "lead-in sentence". This helps keep the content concise, readable, and consistent, thus making it easier to scan the list and understand the benefits and drawbacks.
