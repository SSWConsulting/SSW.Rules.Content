seoDescription: Avoid using "UI" in event names and instead use descriptive names
  that indicate the purpose of the event.
title: Do you avoid "UI" in event names?
type: rule

No "UI" in event names, the event raiser should be unaware of the UI in MVVM and user controls
The handler of the event should then do something on the UI.

<endOfIntro />

```csharp
private void RaiseUIUpdateBidButtonsRed() {
  if (UIUpdateBidButtonsRed != null) {
    UIUpdateBidButtonsRed();
  }
}
```
**❌ Bad example: Avoid "UI" in event names, an event is UI un-aware**  

```csharp
private void RaiseSelectedLotUpdated() {
  if (SelectedLotUpdated != null) {
    SelectedLotUpdated();
  }
}
```
**✅ Good example: When receiving an update on the currently selected item, change the UI correspondingly (or even better: use MVVM and data binding)**
