According to Sydney Morning Herald's "[Flame emails missing the mark](https://www.smh.com.au/national/flame-emails-missing-the-mark-20060216-gdmze2.html)":

\&gt; "The senders of email messages expected their partners to correctly interpret their tone nearly 80% of the time, but in fact, they only scored just over 50%... Those attempting to interpret the message believed they had scored 90% accuracy".

/>
Because there is no "tone of voice" in an email, sarcasm can easily be misinterpreted by the receiver. You can use a smiley face or emoji to soften it up a bit.

Make sure your office is clean when clients come in - you might scare them away with all that mess.
