When formatting a new virtual disk you have attached to a Hyper-V Virtual Machine, you can choose to to format the disk as a **Basic disk** or **Dynamic** **disk** .

A **Dynamic** **disk** might be useful in situations where you want to create a software RAID array, but when using Hyper-V this not a good idea because it prevents Microsoft Data Protection Manager (DPM) from doing Child State Backups (backups while the machine is running).

For this reason, never use **Dynamic disks** inside Hyper-V Virtual Machines.
