Readability of URLs is important, so you should consider making a short URL. However, it is not just making the length as **short** as possible - it should be **friendly**.

<endIntro />

If you use a unfriendly and long link people can't see what they are clicking through to. In fact, this is what most spammers rely on.

  body={<>
    Link: blog2.northwind.com/archive/2022/10/25/now-available-visual-studio-2022-rtm-virtual-machine-with-sample-data-and-hands-on-labs.aspx
  </>}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure="The long URL makes it hard to clearly see what it will take you. People can’t easily type or remember it"
/>



<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    Link: northwind.com/blog/visual-studio-2022-sample-data
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="The nice and clean URL makes it easy to see what the link is about"
/>


Sometimes even a nice URL can be improved by removing all the filler words and just keep the main keywords. This way your URL's are more friendly. Also, make sure your main keywords are relevant for searches.

  </>}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure="The filler words remain"
/>

  body={<>

  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="The filler words removed and only 'juicy' words remain"
/>


### Bit.ly

Sometimes you are not in control of the link. In those cases, use [Bitly](https://bitly.com/) to transform any long URL into a shorter, more readable link.


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    Auto-shorten link: bit.ly/3zTHz8b
  </>}
  figurePrefix="ok"
  figure="Auto-generated shorten URL - It's short but hard to remember"
/>


When have a Bitly account, you can customize links to a more readable option.


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    Custom shorten link: bit.ly/VS-2022-Sample
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Short URL, and easier to remember"
/>
