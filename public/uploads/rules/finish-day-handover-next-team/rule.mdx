Following the Sun succeeds or fails at handover.

If the next team can’t immediately understand the current state of work, momentum is lost and time zones become a liability instead of an advantage.

A clear end-of-day handover ensures that every team starts their day with confidence: knowing what’s been done, what’s next, and what still needs attention.

## What a good handover looks like

Before finishing for the day, teams should ensure all active work is in a handover-ready state. This means the sprint board clearly shows:

* What has been completed and is Done
* What is still In Progress, with explicit next steps
* What is Blocked, including the reason and suggested resolution
* Any risks or decisions that may affect progress

Any blockers or risks should be made visible before signing off, not discovered by the next team.

## Where handover information belongs

Handover information should live with the work itself. Notes should be added directly to each Product Backlog Item (PBI), close to the relevant code, tasks, and acceptance criteria. This allows the next team to continue work without having to chase context through chats, emails, or side conversations.

The goal is that the next team can start their day prepared, and use the Daily Scrum to plan their work—not to reconstruct what happened yesterday.

## 💡 Example

Before finishing for the day, the team in Australia updates the sprint board with clear status and ensures each active PBI contains handover notes and next steps.

One PBI is marked In Progress with explicit guidance on what to do next. Another is Blocked, with the reason and suggested resolution documented.
