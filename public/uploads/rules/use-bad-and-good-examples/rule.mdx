The best way to emphasize your point is to show the pain first, and then the solution. Use "Bad example" and "Good example" with crosses and ticks, respectively, in captions.

<endIntro />

This structure can be used with images, videos, pieces of code, or text in boxes. Just make sure to include the appropriate caption for each element.

Giving the bad example first will raise users' expectation...

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure="Kid not in his seat"
  src="/uploads/rules/use-bad-and-good-examples/ImageBadExample.gif"
/>


Then showing the solution by giving a good example as the result, will make them feel released.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Kid in his seat"
  src="/uploads/rules/use-bad-and-good-examples/kid-in-airplane-seat.jpg"
/>


Usually, further information on how to achive the good example is added **after** the examples. E.g. Add a heading "More information" with extra details.


<boxEmbed
  style="info"
  body={<>
    You may also use ["OK" examples](/rule/#7-captions) for things that are acceptable but can be done better.
  </>}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure=""
/>
