- **Prioritize topics** - Focus on the most critical issues that require board input, leaving operational details for another forum
- **Encourage conciseness** - Promote a culture of brevity in presentations and discussions to cover more ground in less time

Setting and adhering to a specific time limit for board meetings can drastically improve their effectiveness and efficiency.
