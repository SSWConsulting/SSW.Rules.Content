It is really important to understand the difference between a **Proof of Concept (POC)** and a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**. It is also important that clients understand the difference so they know what to expect.

<endOfIntro />

## POC: Proving feasibility

A POC is developed to demonstrate the feasibility of a concept or idea, often focusing on a single aspect of a project. It's about answering the question, _"Can we do this?"_ rather than _"How will we do this in production?"_ POCs are typically:

* **Quick and focused:** Developed rapidly to test a specific hypothesis
* **Experimental:** Used to validate technical feasibility, explore new technologies, or demonstrate a concept
* **Disposable:** Not intended for production use; often discarded after proving the concept

POCs should be built, tested, and thrown away. They are **not intended to be used in a production environment**.

## MVP: Delivering value

Conversely, an MVP is a version of the product that includes just enough features to be usable so stakeholders/users can provide feedback for future product development.

* **End-to-end functionality:** Covers a single feature or user flow in its entirety
* **Production ready:** Developed with more attention to detail, as it will be used in a live environment
* **Foundation for iteration:** Serves as a base to gather user feedback, validate assumptions, and guide future development

### Examples

Consider a startup exploring the use of AI to personalize online shopping experiences. A **POC** might involve creating a basic algorithm to recommend products based on a user's browsing history, tested internally to prove the concept's technical viability.

Building on the POC's success, the startup develops an **MVP** that integrates this personalized recommendation engine into their shopping platform, deploying it to a segment of their user base. This MVP is monitored for user engagement and feedback, shaping the future roadmap of the product.

### Best practices

* **For POCs**: Clearly define the concept you're testing. Limit the scope to essential elements to prove the hypothesis. Remember, POCs are not mini-products
* **For MVPs**: Focus on core functionality that delivers user value. Engage with early users for feedback and be prepared to iterate based on what you learn

    **Tip:** Ensure your client has a clear understanding of the difference before starting development. This will help manage expectations and avoid surprises.
