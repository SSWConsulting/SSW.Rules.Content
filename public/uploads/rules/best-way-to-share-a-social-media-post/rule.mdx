When sharing a post on social media, the ultimate goal is for your planned content to reach more people.

Having said that, the best way to share a post on your socials is by including the original content by resharing it from the source, whether it's a business or personal profile.

This process will:

* Amplify the voice of the original author

* Help your social media engagement when you share insightful content with your audience

* Increase brand awareness of the profile you are resharing from

Remember to:

1. Include thoughts or your opinion on the content shared - [use relevant and related keywords](/include-important-keywords-where-it-matters/)!
2. Don't forget to [include a few hashtags](/use-hashtags) #Ô∏è‚É£
