As a consultancy, your developers expect to see a variety of projects in their time working for you, and if they get stuck on any one client for too long, they may decide to look elsewhere for that variety.

<endIntro />

In order to keep them interested, it’s a good idea to cycle them off and on to particularly long projects. This should be proactively offered to developers, as they may not realise it’s an option.

You also need to make sure this is not a nasty surprise for the client, so it’s best to add it to your contract or Terms and Conditions  so it’s understood from the start, and can always be referred back to later. To soften the blow, offer to cover the costs of the new developer for the handover period (normally 1-2 days)
