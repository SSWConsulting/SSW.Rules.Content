Most developers get promoted. Exceptional developers get promoted to leadership. A business recognises their talent, and want that developer to lead others. The goal is that they will teach and mentor their team members to (hopefully!) reach the same level of exceptionalism.

Moving from a junior developer to a mid/senior developer is simple: just get better at what you already do! But when you're making the jump to leadership roles, things aren't quite so clear cut.

Being a great developer doesn't intrinsically make someone a great leader. It's a different set of skills, and the requirements can seem counterintuitive (or even backward) to what got you there in the first place.

So how do you move from a hero engineer to a force multiplier of an entire team?

Good leadership in the context of leading a development team is less about authority and more about creating the conditions where engineers can do their best work consistently. It blends technical credibility, people leadership, and systems thinking.

## Macro, not micro.

It's very easy to fall into the trap of micromanaging every feature, bug, or decision point. You have the knowledge, and the skills, to solve these problems. But by doing so, you aren't uplifting your team. You're just lifting.

Bad leadership looks like:

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    “Build the feature this way, because I said so.”
  </>}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure="Dictating how something should be done."
  style="greybox"
/>

In the short term, this will ship features. But the long-term damage is compounding. You will:

* Make the team reliant on you to define “this way” for anything and everything
* Rob your team of opportunities to learn and problem-solve
* Bottleneck the project around your available hours

Good leadership looks like:

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    “This feature is our current priority. Any ideas on how we should build it?”
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Allow the team to problem-solve."
  style="greybox"
/>

This approach will take longer in the short-term. You already have the answers, and could ship this feature faster yourself. But that's not the point. Your job is to give your team the opportunities to learn the same skills (and earn the same battle scars) as you.

## Psychological safety

Who's afraid of the big bad wolf? Everybody.

The culture of high-performing dev teams is where everybody feels comfortable and safe with:

* Admitting mistakes
* Asking “stupid” questions
* Challenging ideas

If you speak to your team from an unassailable position of authority, your team will become paralyzed. No one will add a single line of code until you've personally vetted it.

Mistakes happen. Bugs will appear. People will misunderstand requirements. Production will go down. These are the most valuable learning opportunities.

#### ❌ Don't

* Start blame trains
* Make comments like “I told you so”
* Ask questions like “how do you not know that?”

#### ✅ Do

* Have your team critique ideas
* Encourage dissent
* Acknowledge better/different solutions
