Written communication can easily cause misunderstandings. Help the reader understand your message better by:

* Using “&gt;” and indentation when quoting the text from others, like the original email you are replying to.\
  **Note:** “&gt;” is not needed when quoting from a web page
* Make the question/task followed by the respective answer in a logical order
* [Add numbers to tasks](/number-tasks-questions) if the sender forgot.\
  Mention you changed the history. E.g. “(added numbers to tasks in the history, so we can clearly refer to them)”
* Your text should be always kept to the left
  </>}
/>
This way you won't forget any questions in the original email.

**Note:** You do not need to use ">" and indentation, when you are replying to the task that is very clear, because in this case extra text reduces clarity.

**Tip #1:** When using Outlook, the raw “>” character may be automatically formatted to a “>” bullet point. This change is a problem because it may change to a normal bullet point after being sent. To prevent this issue, press Control+Z to turn it back into the raw “>” character.

**Tip #2:** For those using mobile devices the indentation function is not available, try instead using 3 spaces to indent manually

**Tip #3:** Note the extra line break after each reply... this helps group each question with it's answer

**Tip #4:** If you're quoting someone who already used >, you can use >>

**Tip #5:** Some people also [use a different text color in their reply](/when-you-reply-inline-do-you-use-a-different-color), but this is generally overkill

## Markdown

When using Markdown (usually on GitHub), use a "&gt;" symbol to achieve a similar result.

    preset: "default",
    figure: "Indenting tasks in Markdown",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/indent/markdown-indentation-editor.png"
/>

    preset: "default",
    figure: "How it looks",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/indent/markdown-indentation-preview.png"
/>
