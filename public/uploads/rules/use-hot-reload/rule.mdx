Developing mobile apps presents unique challenges compared to web or desktop development. One of the problems is that when using MVVM or using dynamic data on a page, you need to run your app to populate the data and see what your UI will actually look like.

    figure: 'Bad example - Rebuilding your app every time to see small UI changes',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}

To get around this problem use Hot Reload. This lets you make changes to your XAML while debugging your app - as soon as you save your UI will update, without having to stop and rebuild your app.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: 'Good example - Hot reload enable screenshot Windows',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-hot-reload/hot-reload-good.png"
/>

**Tip:** This works on the iOS simulator, the Android emulator, and physical iOS and Android devices.
