<introEmbed
  body={<>
Always specify the schema prefix when creating stored procedures. This way you know that it will always be dbo.procedure_name no matter who is logged in when it is created.

There are 2 other benefits to including the schema prefix on all object references:

1. This prevents the database engine from checking for an object under the users schema first
2. Also avoids the issue where multiple plans are cached for the exact same statement/batch just because they were executed by users with different default schemas.

Aaron Bertrand agrees with this rule - [My stored procedure "best practices" checklist](https://sqlblog.org/2008/10/30/my-stored-procedure-best-practices-checklist).

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE procCustomer_Update @CustomerID INT, ….. BEGIN
```
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Figure: Bad example",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.procCustomer_Update @CustomerID INT, ….. BEGIN
```
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "Figure: Good example",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />
