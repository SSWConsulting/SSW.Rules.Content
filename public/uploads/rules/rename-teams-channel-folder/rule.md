Have you ever made a spelling mistake when you named a Teams channel? Have you then tried to rename the Channel? If so you will notice that the underlying SharePoint folder is still named incorrectly.

There is a workaround to rename the folder correctly.

1. Rename the Team channel

**Note:** Make sure that you rename the folder exactly the same as you named the channel.
