Have you ever made a spelling mistake when you named a Teams channel? Have you then tried to rename the Channel? If so you will notice that the underlying SharePoint folder is still named incorrectly.

There is a workaround to rename the folder correctly.

1. Rename the Team channel


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  captionStyle="default"
  captionText={"Renaming the channel"}
  src="/uploads/rules/rename-teams-channel-folder/renamingachannel2.png"
/>



<boxEmbed
  style="info"
  body={<>
    **Note:** This hasn't changed the name of the folder in SharePoint!

  </>}
  captionStyle="default"
  captionText={""}
/>


2. Delete the channel


<imageEmbed

  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  captionStyle="default"
  captionText={"Delete the channel"}
  src="/uploads/rules/rename-teams-channel-folder/renamingachannel4.png"
/>


3. Now, in SharePoint, rename the folder


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  captionStyle="default"
  captionText={"Renaming the folder in SharePoint"}
  src="/uploads/rules/rename-teams-channel-folder/renamingachannel5.png"
/>



<boxEmbed
  style="info"
  body={<>
    **Note:** Make sure that you rename the folder exactly the same as you named the channel.
![Figure: Make sure the name is the same as the channel](/uploads/rules/rename-teams-channel-folder/renamingachannel6.png)
  </>}
  captionStyle="default"
  captionText={""}
/>


4. Click the ellipses beside the Team name | Manage Team

   
<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  captionStyle="default"
  captionText={"Manage the Team"}
  src="/uploads/rules/rename-teams-channel-folder/renamingachannel7.png"
/>


5. Click Channels | Select the arrow beside deleted | Choose restore beside the channel that you wish to restore

   
<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  captionStyle="default"
  captionText={"Restore the channel"}
  src="/uploads/rules/rename-teams-channel-folder/renamingachannel8.png"
/>
