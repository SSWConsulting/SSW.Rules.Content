Bosses are busy and forget. Just like you encourage a developer to book their own appointment (see [Do you know to make sure that you book the next appointment before you leave the client?](/do-you-know-to-make-sure-that-you-book-the-next-appointment-before-you-leave-the-client)), a boss should be the same.

<endOfIntro />

When your boss takes a call from someone wanting to book an appointment there are two options to offer the caller:

1. create a 'Outlook Calendar Appointment', or
2. call their PA and have them double check that they are free, and then create an Outlook Calendar Appointment

It used to be that if the appointment was for the same day, your boss would have to take option 2 to keep the PA informed but now with mobile devices you should generally use option 1.
