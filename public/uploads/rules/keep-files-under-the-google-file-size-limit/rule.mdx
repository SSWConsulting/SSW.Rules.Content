  body={<>
A maximum file size may be enforced per crawler. Content which is after the maximum file size may be ignored. Google currently enforces a size limit of 500kb.
  </>}
/>
Regarding other files:

* All files larger than 30MB will be completely ignored.
* HTML, the search appliance indexes up to 2.5MB of the document, caches it, and discards the rest.
* A non-HTML format, the search appliance:

1. Downloads the non-HTML file.
2. Converts the non-HTML file to HTML.
3. If the converted content is less than 4,000,000 bytes, indexes the first 2MB of the HTML file. (Take note that 4MB=4,194,304 bytes.) If the converted content exceeds 4,000,000 bytes, the document is not indexed. However, the document and a link to it do appear in search results.
4. Caches the first 2MB of the HTML file.
5. Discards the rest of the HTML file and the non-HTML file.
