Top is an efficient way of identifying what a tables structure and data look like.

Retrieving all the data in a table is a common pattern especially when someone is looking into a production incident. If the table in question is a large table, grabbing all the rows back may make the problem worse.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users
```

Using TOP to reduce the number of rows being returned makes this a much less expensive operation.

```sql
SELECT TOP 20 FROM Users
```

TOP works with filtering and joining, so you can use it to get a sample of only the rows you are interested in.
