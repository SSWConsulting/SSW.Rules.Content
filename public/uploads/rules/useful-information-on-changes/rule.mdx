When creating a Pull Request with your changes, it is important to have a good description that will help the reviewer to understand what was done.

Leaving the description blank is common and not helpful. There are also cases where people overexplain. **You should try to include just the right amount of information.**

**PR description:** Changes made:

1. Added missing video figure to embedded YouTube video
2. Removed the unecessary closing brackets from:
   Use emojis. See our rule on emojis in Scrum).
   To:
   Use emojis. See our rule on emojis in Scrum

Try to make generic comments that objectively summarize your changes. This way the reviewer will know what to expect and confirm the changes by looking at the file diffs.

### Many small changes

You should summarize by saying: _“Improved readability”_ OR _“Fixed typos and grammar”_

### Big and complex changes

You should include a demonstration of the change. E.g. A [screenshot](/screenshots-avoid-walls-of-text) to show text/UI changes, or a [Done video](/record-a-quick-and-dirty-done-video) to demo functionality changes.
