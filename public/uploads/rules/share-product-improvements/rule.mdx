Social Media is important for companies, and the employees. One of the things you can post is the improvements your products e.g. New features, bug fixes, upgrades etc.

Businesses should get their developers to do this, and then re-post it.

Your followers may not know about the changes and the ones who are grateful are likely to retweet or like your post. This also helps build a community around your product.
