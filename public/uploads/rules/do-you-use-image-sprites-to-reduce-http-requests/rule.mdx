A sprite is an image that has all of your other images inside of it, so if your sprite has 5 images, you’d be getting rid of 4 HTTP requests and speeding your site’s loading time up by the time for each of those 4 requests latency. You will use CSS selectors for each link to display only a portion of the image sprite - effectively showing just the image you need.

/>
The benefits to use CSS image sprites are:

* to save bandwidth
* to reduce HTTP server requests
* to speed up page load times

Ensure that the file size of your master image isn't greater than the sum of its pieces.

  } }
