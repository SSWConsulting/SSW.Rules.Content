When you're making a cake the things that matter are the ingredients you use.

Likewise, when you’re making a video, the things that matter are the cuts you choose.

### Jump Cut

A jump cut is a straight cut between the same piece of footage (which helps shorten the video).

For example, if you are doing a piece to camera (single presenter talking to the camera), you can cut out parts in between sentences – and leave it obvious - to quicken the pace of the video. This is a popular editing method used by YouTubers and is great for more casual style of videos.
