IM calls can get noisy fast. Even a bit of background chatter or typing can distract everyone and make it hard to follow what's being said, especially in group calls. Muting your mic when you’re not speaking shows respect for others’ focus and helps keep meetings productive.

<endOfIntro />

## When to mute

* When someone comes to talk to you — Don’t make the team listen to your side conversations
* When there’s background noise — Kids, traffic, fans, or office chatter? Hit mute
* When you’re not contributing — If you’re mostly listening, stay muted until it’s your turn
* When eating or typing — Even quiet keyboards and snacks are picked up easily by mics
* When you step away

Forgetting to unmute is common. Get in the habit of checking your mic status before speaking to keep the meeting flowing smoothly.
