CRM is used to store and retrieve Client information, Opportunities, Projects, and Bookings.

- **Contact details** - You can use the mobile app if you’re out and about to get contact details (mobile number, email, or address)
  "What’s Mr. Northwind’s phone number?"
- **Finding out info** - View Power BI report to see who has been working for that client and when
  "In the past year, who has worked for Mr. Northwind?"
- **Linking to the TimePro or Teams** locations for a client
  "Mr. Northwind emailed me an important doc and I want to save it… Do they have an MS Team?"
- **Entering or updating Opportunity or Project data** (not Projects don't exist out of the box with CRM, but they’re easy customization to add)
  "I have to enter a timesheet but there’s no project… where do I add one?"
- **User information**
  "What is JK’s default rate and Title?"
- **Booking** yourself for a client or leave (if you don’t have access to Outlook)
  "I have to take tomorrow off but left my laptop at work… how can I put in leave?"
