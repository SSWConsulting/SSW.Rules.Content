You can give ChatGPT examples of the type of output you want, including the format. Each example you feed it is known as a “shot”.

Understanding when to use 0-shot, 1-shot, or multi-shot prompts can help you get the most out of ChatGPT. These approaches allow the model to learn from different contexts, making it more likely to generate the desired output.

Here are some guidelines for using 0-shot, 1-shot, and multi-shot prompts:
Note: If you are a developer, also read this [guide to using shot prompts with the OpenAI API.](https://labelbox.com/guides/zero-shot-learning-few-shot-learning-fine-tuning/)

### 0-shot prompts

Used when you want the model to generate a response without any examples. These prompts can be helpful for general questions or tasks where providing examples is unnecessary or could add confusion.

Use 0-shot prompts when you trust the model's general knowledge to provide a sufficient answer.

### 1-shot prompts

Provide a single example of the desired output, helping to guide the model's response. This approach can be useful when you need a specific format or style or when the task requires some level of guidance.

Use 1-shot prompts when you want to nudge the model in the right direction without overwhelming it with multiple examples.

Example 1-shot prompt:


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    "Translate the following English sentences into French. Here's an example:
'I love playing soccer.' -&gt; 'J'aime jouer au football.'

Now translate: 'She enjoys reading books.'"
  </>}
  captionStyle="default"
  caption={"1-shot example - providing a single example of translation"}
/>


### Multi-shot prompts

Offer multiple examples, allowing the model to learn from various instances. These prompts can be beneficial when dealing with complex tasks, where providing a range of examples helps the model better understand the desired outcome.

Use multi-shot prompts when a single example might not be sufficient for guiding the model or when you want to demonstrate a pattern or trend.

Example multi-shot prompt:


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    "Translate the following English sentences into French. Here are some examples:

- 'I love playing soccer.' -&gt; 'J'aime jouer au football.'
- 'The weather is nice today.' -&gt; 'Le temps est agréable aujourd'hui.'

Now translate: 'They are going to the park.'"
  </>}
  captionStyle="default"
  caption={"Multi-shot example - providing multiple examples of translations"}
/>


By knowing when to use 0-shot, 1-shot, or multi-shot prompts, you can optimize your interactions with ChatGPT and receive more accurate and tailored responses.
