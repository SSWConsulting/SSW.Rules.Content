Websites that use frames often don't get crawled by search engine spiders. The web was designed in such a way that every URL is supposed to correspond to a web page, and with framed websites, this is not the case. We recommend that you avoid frames altogether.

<endIntro />

Here is [what Google says on "framed sites"](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1012049?hl=en):

> "the Navigation Summary and Site Overlay reports for sites with frames is not likely to provide useful information, since every frame with tag on it will be recorded as a separate pageview. Additionally, the order of these pageviews will depend on the order in which the frames are loaded, instead of the actual navigation path taken by your users."
