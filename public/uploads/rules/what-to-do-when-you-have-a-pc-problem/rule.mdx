When your laptop/desktop PC malfunctions, it could be something to do with Windows updates or driver upgrades, or maybe a firmware update. Before reporting it to SysAdmins, you should follow the following steps:
  </>}
/>
1. Run a Windows update (Settings | Windows update)
2. If that doesn't fix the issue, check if there are any additional updates (Settings | Windows update | Aditional options | Optional updates) - Most of the driver updates will be hidden in this location

/>

3. If the problem still didn't resolve then, check the manufacturer's updates via their support assist portal (e.g. If your laptop is Lenovo then open [Lenovo System Updates](https://support.lenovo.com/au/en/downloads/ds012808-lenovo-system-update-for-windows-10-7-32-bit-64-bit-desktop-notebook-workstation)

    shouldDisplay: true
  }}

/>

4. Still, if the issue isn't fixed, report it to SysAdmins by sending an email that should include the steps that you have done to troubleshoot the problem.

If your operating system needs to be reinstalled, follow [Do you know the quickest way to get your Windows 10 SOE up and running?](/do-you-know-the-quickest-way-to-get-your-windows-10-soe-up-and-running)
