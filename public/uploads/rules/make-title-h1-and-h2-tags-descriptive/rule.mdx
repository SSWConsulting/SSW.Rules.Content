The **&lt;title&gt;**,  **&lt;h1&gt;**, and **&lt;h2&gt;** tags need to be descriptive. They should briefly describe the purpose or content of the page.

<endIntro />

Have a look at the following 2 images. The first image is a bad example as the title bar and page heading are not very descriptive. The second image is a better example as title bar and page heading are more informative.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure="Bad example - Non-descriptive title/headings"
  src="/uploads/rules/make-title-h1-and-h2-tags-descriptive/bad-title-headings.png"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"

  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Good example - Descriptive title/headings"

We have a program called [SSW Code Auditor](http://codeauditor.com/) to check for this rule.
