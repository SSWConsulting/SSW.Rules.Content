The **&lt;title&gt;**,  **&lt;h1&gt;**, and **&lt;h2&gt;** tags need to be descriptive. They should briefly describe the purpose or content of the page.
Have a look at the following 2 images. The first image is a bad example as the title bar and page heading are not very descriptive. The second image is a better example as title bar and page heading are more informative.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: 'Bad example - Non-descriptive title/headings',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/make-title-h1-and-h2-tags-descriptive/bad-title-headings.png"
/>

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: 'Good example - Descriptive title/headings',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/make-title-h1-and-h2-tags-descriptive/good-title-headings.png"
/>

We have a program called [SSW Code Auditor](http://codeauditor.com/) to check for this rule.
