seoDescription: Ensure your website displays correctly across multiple browsers, including
  Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari. Focus on Chrome and
  Firefox, as they are most widely used, but also test in Edge and Safari to catch
  any compatibility issues.

You should design a website to look good when being viewed in **Google Chrome**, **Mozilla Firefox**, the latest version of **Edge** and **Safari** unless the client specifically requests otherwise.

There are a lot of other browsers available, but it is important to consider that most other browsers are based on the most used browser nowadays.

/>
Note that readable is not perfect. There may be some page elements that are less than perfect, but it's just not worth of time to fix small bugs in every single browser, except for **Google Chrome**.

You must test your website on the major browsers, though, because that there will be more differences and problems than you would think. The typical things that you will need to fix are:

- Menus
- Dynamic HTML
- VB Script

You should be able to fix all formatting and layout bugs by editing the CSS file.

    **Note:** If a browser represents less than 2% of your website views in Analytics, then you shouldn't bother.

E.g. Google archived this link - https://code.google.com/archive/p/html5-js/ - which was used as an HTML5 shim and Respond.js for IE8 support of HTML5 elements and media queries. Since IE represents a small percentage of views it can be removed instead of updated to a new working shim.
