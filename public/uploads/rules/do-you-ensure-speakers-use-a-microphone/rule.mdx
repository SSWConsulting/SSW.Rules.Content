It’s sometimes quite hard to hear who is speaking. Usually, the person leading the meeting is audible because they’ll be using a mic, but if others want to talk, they should come up next to the presenter and speak (if they are in the same room). This is important, as people who are attending the meeting remotely can hear what is being discussed.

It’s worse when there are multiple conversations going on – let one person speak at a time, and make sure they’re close to the mic. No side conversations!
