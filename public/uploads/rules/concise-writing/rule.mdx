  attention, prevent messages from being overlooked, and ensure accessibility for
  busy individuals.
title: Do you keep your writing short and concise?
type: rule

In today's fast-paced world, lengthy emails, web content, and instant messages can be overwhelming and difficult to navigate.

<endIntro />

## Embrace the principle of "less is more"

By being concise and focusing on relevant information only, we can capture the reader's attention and prevent important messages from being overlooked or postponed due to time constraints.


<boxEmbed

  body={<>
    "The team conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the project’s scope and objectives to determine the best course of action moving forward."
  </>}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure="Bad example - Unnecessary filler words"
/>



<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    "The team has evaluated the project."
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Good example - Fewer words without losing meaning."
/>


Keep your writing **short**, **direct**, and **to the point**, ensuring our messages are accessible and impactful, even for busy individuals on the go.
