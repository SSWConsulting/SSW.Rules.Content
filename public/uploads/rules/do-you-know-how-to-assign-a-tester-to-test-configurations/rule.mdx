In Azure Test Plans, you can assign test cases for different configurations to be run by different testers.

To assign a tester to run a test case for a configuration, select the Test Plan and go to the Execute tab, then assign the tester as shown below:

  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'Assign a tester to a test case & configuration',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-how-to-assign-a-tester-to-test-configurations/assign-tester-to-test-cases.jpg"
/>

**Tip:** To assign a number of test cases to the same tester, multi-select the test cases (using the checkboxes) and then use the same steps as above.
