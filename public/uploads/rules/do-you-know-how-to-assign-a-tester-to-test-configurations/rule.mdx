To assign a tester to run a test case for a configuration, select the Test Plan and go to the Execute tab, then assign the tester as shown below:

  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Assign a tester to a test case & configuration",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-how-to-assign-a-tester-to-test-configurations/assign-tester-to-test-cases.jpg"

**Tip:** To assign a number of test cases to the same tester, multi-select the test cases (using the checkboxes) and then use the same steps as above.
