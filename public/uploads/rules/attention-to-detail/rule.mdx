Ensuring thoroughness and accuracy in your work is crucial, but it's easy to overlook important details when you're under pressure or rushing to meet deadlines. Attention to detail can make or break a project. Consider the classic mistake of sending an important email without the attachment mentioned in the text. Such oversights, while seemingly minor, can undermine your professionalism and the effectiveness of your communication.

The ultimate way to ensure your bases are covered is to get someone else to check the work as per the ["checked by xxx" rule](/checked-by-xxx).

However, before you get the work checked, you should cover as many details as possible by yourself.

## What to do before a "Checked by"

Preparing for a "Checked by" is essential because it ensures you have your ducks in a row and keeps the "Checked by" call as short as possible.

That makes it a smooth experience for the person you are calling and ensures they will have a good impression of your work.

Here are some things you should do to prepare:

### 1. Double check your work

Before sending out an email or finishing a task, do a once over of the final end product to ensure you are happy with the output.

### 2. Avoid assumptions

If your email includes "I think..." or "...as far as I know", it should trigger you to spend a little extra time checking those assumptions before pressing send. This can often avoid costly mistakes, as someone else building on top of your wrong assumption can compound the error.

### 3. Use ChatGPT and spelling/grammar checkers

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) is great at serving as a second set of eyes. Pass in the email or information you want to convey and ask it if you missed anything. Even better, use [Reflexion](/reflexion) to critique your work. The results will give you confidence that your response is correct and adequate.

Spell checkers like [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com) are also great tools. They check your work on the fly and flag any issues immediately.

### 4. Take your time

It's easy to feel rushed when you are under the pump, but even in such situations it's important to take the time to do a task properly.

As you do the task, meticulously check each step, and check and re-check your work as you go. Better to deliver the task a little bit late than to deliver it with a lot of mistakes.

### 5. Use a checklist

If you're doing a task that involves a long set of steps, turn it into a checklist. Copy the tasks into notepad and strike them out as you go, that way you know they are done.

### 6. Break tasks into smaller parts

Tackle large projects by [breaking them down into more manageable parts](/break-tasks). This can help you focus on the details of each segment without feeling overwhelmed.

### 7. Don't switch focus

Try to focus on a single task until it is completed. If you juggle multiple tasks you are likely to forget things in both tasks and end up with a worse result.

### 8. Rest and take breaks

Ensure you're well-rested and take regular breaks. Fatigue can significantly impair your ability to pay attention to details.

## Conclusion

By implementing these strategies, you can significantly enhance your attention to detail, leading to higher quality work and fewer mistakes. Remember, being detailed-oriented doesn't mean being perfect but rather being diligent and conscientious in your efforts to minimize errors and oversights.
