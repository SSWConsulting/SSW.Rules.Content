### Understanding Certification Rewards

Certification Reward is a special category of leave granted to employees as a form of recognition for their effort and time invested in completing Microsoft certifications. Here's how it works:

1. **Award Criteria:** Employees become eligible for a Certification Reward upon successfully completing a Microsoft certification
2. **Visibility and Tracking:** A distinct leave category should be used within your accounting system specifically for Certification Reward

### Not a Fairwork Mandate

It's important to note that the Certification Reward is not mandated by Fairwork. Instead, it's a proactive approach to incentivize its team members to engage in professional development, specifically around Microsoft technologies. This strategic focus not only enhances individual skill sets but also elevates the collective expertise within the company, ensuring you remain competitive and innovative in delivering solutions.

The Certification Reward system exemplifies how valuing and investing in employees' growth can create a dynamic and forward-thinking workplace culture. It's a clear win-win: employees expand their expertise, and strengthens your company's capability to deliver cutting-edge solutions.
