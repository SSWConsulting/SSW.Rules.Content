Below is a report screen that is fairly common that developers create, they will make it so every time the page is loaded the user will have to reselect their options. To make it simpler the options should be stored in a cookie or database and be already pre-selected once the page is reloaded, as it is likely they will want to use the same or slightly modified query. If they don't then they can simply select what they are after anyway.
