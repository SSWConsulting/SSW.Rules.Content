When you're building a custom AI application using a GPT API you'll probably want the model to respond in a way that fits your application or company. You can achieve this using the system prompt.

<endIntro />

## What is the system prompt?

Requests to and from a GPT API generally have 3 types of messages, also known as roles or prompts:

### 1. User

User messages are any messages that your application has sent to the model.

### 2. Assistant

Assistant messages are any messages that the model has sent back to your application.

### 3. System

The system prompt is sent with every request to the API and instructs the model how it should respond to each request.

When we don't set a system prompt the user can tell the model to act however they would like it to:

    **Note:** Depending on the model you're using, you may need to be more firm with your system prompt for the model to listen. Test your prompt using [OpenAI's Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground) before deploying.
