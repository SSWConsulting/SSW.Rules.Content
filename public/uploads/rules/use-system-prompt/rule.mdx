When you're building a custom AI application using a GPT API you'll probably want the model to respond in a way that fits your application or company. You can achieve this using the system prompt.
  </>}

## What is the system prompt?

Requests to and from a GPT API generally have 3 types of messages, also known as roles or prompts:

### 1. User

User messages are any messages that your application has sent to the model.

### 2. Assistant

Assistant messages are any messages that the model has sent back to your application.

### 3. System

The system prompt is sent with every request to the API and instructs the model how it should respond to each request.

When we don't set a system prompt the user can tell the model to act however they would like it to:

  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: "Bad example - GPT's responses without a system prompt",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/use-system-prompt/without-system-prompt.png"

  } }

    **Note:** Depending on the model you're using, you may need to be more firm with your system prompt for the model to listen. Test your prompt using [OpenAI's Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground) before deploying.
