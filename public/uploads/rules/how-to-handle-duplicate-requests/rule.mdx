Sometimes you get the same task from 2 different people. Sometimes even the same person sends over-lapping emails. Sometimes you find duplicated PBIs.

Whether you keep a backlog or are just using your email inbox as a to-do list, you have a choice to make:
  </>}
/>
**A:** Get rid of the duplicates and only keep one (you need to spend time informing everyone about the merge)

**B:** ==Recommended== - Keep them all and when you do it, reply to all the emails with your ‘Done’ OR close each of the PBIs. (Of course it is a good idea to relate those tasks by adding links or the email subjects)

<emailEmbed

  to="Bob"

  body={<>
    ## Hi Bob,

Not done yet. Closing this, as it will be done in another email subject: **“Form options need refresh”** from Jason
  </>}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: "Bad example – This email will never get a ‘done’ when completed",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
