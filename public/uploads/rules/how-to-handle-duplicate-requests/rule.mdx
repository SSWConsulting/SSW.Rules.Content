seoDescription: When handling duplicate requests, it's recommended to keep all duplicates
  and reply to each email or close each task individually. This approach ensures that
  you don't miss any updates and keeps your records organized.

Sometimes you get the same task from 2 different people. Sometimes even the same person sends over-lapping emails. Sometimes you find duplicated PBIs.

Whether you keep a backlog or are just using your email inbox as a to-do list, you have a choice to make:
  </>}
/>
**A:** Get rid of the duplicates and only keep one (you need to spend time informing everyone about the merge)

**B:** ==Recommended== - Keep them all and when you do it, reply to all the emails with your ‘Done’ OR close each of the PBIs. (Of course it is a good idea to relate those tasks by adding links or the email subjects)
