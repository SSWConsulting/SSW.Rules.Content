In your inbox, it's a good idea to reduce noise by giving more attention to emails where you're on the "To" field, and dim the ones you're CC'd on.

You can do this through 'Conditional formatting' in the 'View Settings', by creating a rule that changes the font of emails to grey if you’re in the 'CC' field.
