Favicons are more than just a single icon, and they require proper optimisation to display correctly on all devices.

## What is a Favicon?

Favicons are most commonly used to display a custom icon on a browser tab, but they can also be used to alter the display of your website in other cases such as Android, iPhone, Windows, and Mac icons.

## How to Check Your Favicon

Even if your website has a favicon, it may not be fully compliant.
You can use [realfavicongenerator.net](https://realfavicongenerator.net/favicon_checker) to check your website.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: "Bad example - Favicon does not display properly on all devices",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/optimise-favicon/bad-favicon-1.png"
/>

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good example - Favicon displays properly on all devices",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/optimise-favicon/good-favicon-1.png"
/>

## How to Update Your Favicon

[realfavicongenerator.net](https://realfavicongenerator.net) also has a favicon generator that you can use to generate a set of icons and meta tags from a single image.

The site will guide you through all the settings and display a preview of how your favicon will look on each device.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Choosing our favicon settings",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/optimise-favicon/favicon-generator.png"
/>

Once you're happy with how it looks, click `Generate your Favicons and HTML code` and you will be given instructions on how to install your new favicon with a number of popular technologies, such as HTML5, ASP.NET Core and NodeJS.
