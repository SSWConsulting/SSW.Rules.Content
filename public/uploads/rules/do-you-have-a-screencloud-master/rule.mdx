Just like having a [Schema Master for Database Design](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/have-a-schema-master), you should have a single owner for your digital signage platform.

ScreenCloud should be no different.

A ScreenCloud Master is the person responsible for governance, security, reliability, and change control across your ScreenCloud organization.

<endIntro />

The ScreenCloud Master should review and approve major changes, including:

* Owner/Admin access, group permissions, and Channels and Playlist design
* Screen lifecycle changes (add/remove/replace/transfer screens), especially where licensing/cost can change
* Publishing governance for Channels/Playlists and cross-space sharing permissions
* Operating hours and timezone standards across offices/Spaces
* Monitoring and incident response for offline screens, cache/reboot procedures, and alerting
* Audit/compliance checks using Audit Logs, Proof of Play, and Playback Logs

Without a ScreenCloud Master, teams often get inconsistent permissions, accidental license growth, and unreliable screen operations. With one, you get safer changes, clearer acountability, and more predictable signage outcomes.
