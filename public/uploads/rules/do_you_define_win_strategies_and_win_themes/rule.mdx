You can have the best solution and the strongest team, but still lose a tender if your response feels generic, supplier-centric, or disconnected from what the customer actually cares about. This usually happens when teams start writing before they agree on \*how they are going to win\*.

<endIntro />

Defining clear Win Strategies and Win Themes upfront ensures your tender tells a focused, persuasive story that evaluators can easily understand, remember, and score highly.

## What is a Win Strategy?

A Win Strategy is the deliberate plan for how you will win a specific opportunity. It is set before writing begins and guides every decision made during the tender process.

A strong Win Strategy defines:

\- The customer’s real issues and buying drivers

\- The decision makers and what matters to them

\- The competitive landscape

\- Your chosen Win Themes

\- How your solution is positioned

\- Key risks and how they will be mitigated

\- The tone and narrative of the response

### What a Win Strategy does

A well-defined Win Strategy:

\- Determines whether the opportunity is worth pursuing

\- Prevents generic, compliance-only responses

\- Aligns the team on messaging and positioning

\- Shapes the Executive Summary

\- Guides what evidence is included and how it is presented

\### What a Win Strategy is not

A Win Strategy is \*\*not\*\*:

\- A technical design

\- A project plan

\- A list of answers to RFT questions

\- A marketing document

Think of the Win Strategy as the \*\*blueprint\*\* for the tender. Without it, even well-written responses tend to feel unfocused and are much harder to win.

\## What are Win Themes?

\*\*Win Themes\*\* are the small number of client-specific messages (typically \*\*1–3\*\*, no more than \*\*5\*\*) that explain \*why the customer should choose SSW over every other option\*.

They are not slogans or generic value statements. A Win Theme must be tangible, customer-relevant, and supported by evidence.

Win Themes are the evaluator’s reasons to believe that \*\*SSW is the best choice\*\*.

\### What Win Themes do

Effective Win Themes:

\- Connect the customer’s key issues to SSW’s strengths

\- Reinforce SSW’s differentiation throughout the response

\- Provide consistency across all sections of the tender

\- Help evaluators quickly understand and remember our value

\### Characteristics of strong Win Themes

Strong Win Themes are:

\- Directly relevant to the customer’s priorities

\- Written in the customer’s language

\- Supported by evidence

\- Repeated consistently across the response

\- Easy to recognise and remember

\## What Win Themes are not

Win Themes are \*\*not\*\*:

\- Marketing taglines

\- Lists of capabilities

\- Generic claims like “best in class” or “industry leading”

\- Statements that every competitor could make

\- Internally focused messages about SSW rather than the customer

Tender responses should always be about \*\*what matters to the customer\*\*, not what we think is impressive about ourselves.

\## Examples

\::: greybox

“SSW stands above other vendors because of our hiring process and the quality of our people.”

\:::

\::: bad  

Figure: Bad Example – Supplier-centric, impossible to verify, and something every competitor can claim.

\:::

\::: greybox

“SSW’s experienced delivery team ensures high quality outcomes and reduces delivery risk for the customer.”

\:::

\::: ok  

Figure: OK Example – More customer-focused, but still generic and unsupported by evidence.

\:::

\::: greybox

“Because SSW has already delivered and supported custom solutions within your .NET-based platform, we understand your architecture, integration points, and delivery standards. This reduces onboarding time, lowers delivery risk, and enables measurable progress within the first sprint, rather than the typical discovery-heavy start required by new vendors.”

\:::

\::: good  

Figure: Good Example – Client-specific, clearly differentiated, outcome-focused, and supported by implied evidence.

\:::

\## Win Themes must flow through the entire response

Tender responses are often split into sections, with different evaluators scoring different parts independently. Every major section should reinforce at least one Win Theme.

This ensures that:

\- Evaluators quickly grasp why SSW is the best choice

\- Key messages are remembered during scoring and comparison

\- The response feels cohesive and intentional rather than fragmented

\---

\*\*Summary\*\*

Win Strategies and Win Themes are critical to winning tenders. The Win Strategy sets the direction, while Win Themes provide the memorable, customer-focused reasons to choose SSW. When done well, they make your tender more persuasive, consistent, and far more likely to win.
