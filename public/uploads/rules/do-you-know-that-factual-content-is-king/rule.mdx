It is easy to think that "Content is King"; it is a well-known [quote from an article by Bill Gates in 1996](http://www.craigbailey.net/content-is-king-by-bill-gates/).  But incorrect content is not  very useful, so we think that " **factual** content is king".

You should always:

- Fix up your mistakes, and
- Strike through content that is now been superseded, and add a comment. E.g. "This is now not an issue as it was fixed up in TFS SP1"
