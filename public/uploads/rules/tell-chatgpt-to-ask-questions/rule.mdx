Sometimes, ChatGPT may require more context or clarification to provide a helpful response. Encouraging the model to ask questions when it needs more information can improve the quality of its answers and prevent misunderstandings.

/>
Here are some tips for prompting ChatGPT to ask for more context:

- Invite ChatGPT to ask for clarification in the initial prompt if necessary
- Emphasize that it's OK to ask questions if the model doesn't have enough information
- Be prepared to provide additional details if ChatGPT requests them
- Consider adding "On each prompt, let me know roughly how many questions are left", to gauge if you want to answer all questions
- If you’re feeling lazy or short for time, you can even get it to only ask you multiple choice questions.

By encouraging ChatGPT to request more context when necessary, you can ensure that the model generates more accurate and helpful responses tailored to your specific needs.
