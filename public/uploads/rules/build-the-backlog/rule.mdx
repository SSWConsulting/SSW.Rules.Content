All good Scrum teams have a backlog. The backlog is built by taking a conversation and recording it as one or more **Product Backlog Items** (PBIs) (e.g. Azure DevOps) or **Issues** (e.g. GitHub, JIRA).

You should [create PBIs during or straight after the conversation](/report-bugs-and-suggestions), rather than using emails that may never be entered into the backlog.

The Product Owner is responsible for owning the Product Backlog. See the video on [how to be a good Product Owner](/do-you-know-the-how-to-be-a-good-product-owner).

Although these requirements come from the Product Owner, it is often the developers who will record these PBIs.

## ❌ Don’t use email as a backlog

<imageEmbed alt="Image" size="large" showBorder={false} figurePrefix="bad" figure="This is a poor way to add a PBI/Issue as you can’t order emails by the business priority" src="/uploads/rules/build-the-backlog/EmailBadExample.png" />

## ✅ Use DevOps platforms

### 1. GitHub Issues (Recommended)

<imageEmbed alt="Image" size="large" showBorder={false} figurePrefix="good" figure="Github Issues" src="/uploads/rules/build-the-backlog/GitHubIssues.png" />

### 2. Azure DevOps 

E.g. [https://ssw.visualstudio.com](https://ssw.visualstudio.com)

<imageEmbed alt="Image" size="large" showBorder={false} figurePrefix="good" figure="Azure DevOps allows you to enter an item into the backlog, in any priority order" src="/uploads/rules/build-the-backlog/AzureDevOpsBacklog_1710232021931.png" />
