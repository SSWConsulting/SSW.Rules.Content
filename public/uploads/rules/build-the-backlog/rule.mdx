<introEmbed
  body={<>
All good Scrum teams have a backlog. The backlog is built by taking a conversation and recording it as one or more **Product Backlog Items** (PBIs) (e.g. Azure DevOps) or **Issues** (e.g. GitHub, JIRA).

You should [create PBIs during or straight after the conversation](/report-bugs-and-suggestions), rather than using emails that may never be entered into the backlog.

  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Get typing during a conversation to make the meeting tangible",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/build-the-backlog/Typing.jpg"
/>

The Product Owner is responsible for owning the Product Backlog. See the video on ["Do you know how to be a good Product Owner?"](/do-you-know-the-how-to-be-a-good-product-owner)

Although these requirements come from the Product Owner, it is often the developers who will record these PBIs.

#### 1. Emails

  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: "Bad example - This is a poor way to add a PBI/Issue as you can’t order emails by the business priority",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/build-the-backlog/EmailBadExample.png"
/>

#### GitHub Issues (Recommended)

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good example - Github Issues",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/build-the-backlog/GitHubIssues.png"
/>

#### 3. Azure DevOps - E.g. <https://ssw.visualstudio.com>

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good example - Azure DevOps allows you to enter an item into the backlog, in any priority order",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/build-the-backlog/AzureDevOpsBacklog_1710232021931.png"
/>
