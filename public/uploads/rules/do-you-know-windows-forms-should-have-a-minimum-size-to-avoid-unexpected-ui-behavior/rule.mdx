Therefore, a standard has been built to ensure Windows forms have a minimum size.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good Example - User friendly window form",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-windows-forms-should-have-a-minimum-size-to-avoid-unexpected-ui-behavior/Minisize.gif"
