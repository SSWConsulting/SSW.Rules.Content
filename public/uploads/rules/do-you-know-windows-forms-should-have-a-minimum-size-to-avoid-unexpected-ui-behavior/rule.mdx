If windows form does not setup a minimum size, your users could have unpredictable form behaviour as seen below:
<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: 'Bad example - Unexpected window form',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-windows-forms-should-have-a-minimum-size-to-avoid-unexpected-ui-behavior/../../assets/Bugsize.gif"
/>

Therefore, a standard has been built to ensure Windows forms have a minimum size.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: 'Good Example - User friendly window form',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-windows-forms-should-have-a-minimum-size-to-avoid-unexpected-ui-behavior/../../assets/Minisize.gif"
/>
