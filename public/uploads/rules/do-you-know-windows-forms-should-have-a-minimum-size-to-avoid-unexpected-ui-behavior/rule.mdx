If windows form does not setup a minimum size, your users could have unpredictable form behaviour as seen below:

<endIntro />

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure="Unexpected window form"
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-windows-forms-should-have-a-minimum-size-to-avoid-unexpected-ui-behavior/Bugsize.gif"
/>


Therefore, a standard has been built to ensure Windows forms have a minimum size.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="User friendly window form"
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-windows-forms-should-have-a-minimum-size-to-avoid-unexpected-ui-behavior/Minisize.gif"
/>
