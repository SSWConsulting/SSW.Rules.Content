  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: "Bad example - Unexpected window form",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }

Therefore, a standard has been built to ensure Windows forms have a minimum size.

    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good Example - User friendly window form",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
