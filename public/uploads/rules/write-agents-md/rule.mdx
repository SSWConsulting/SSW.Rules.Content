AI coding assistants like Cursor and GitHub Copilot are incredibly powerful, but they work best when they understand your project's specific architecture, coding standards, and common tasks. Without this context, they may suggest patterns that don't align with your codebase.

`AGENTS.md`is an agreed-upon standard between all the big AI players, replacing things like `.cursorrules` and `copilot_instructions.md`.

## Why use AGENTS.md?

An `AGENTS.md` file acts as a "manual" for AI agents. It provides a centralized place to define:

* **Architecture overview** - Explain the tech stack and how different layers interact
* **Coding standards** - Define naming conventions, preferred libraries, and patterns
* **Common commands** - List freque ntly used scripts for building, testing, and linting
* **Key patterns** - Provide code examples for common tasks (e.g. adding a new API endpoint)

By providing this information, you ensure that the AI's suggestions are consistent with your project's existing structure, reducing the need for manual corrections.

## Creating an AGENTS.md

A great example of this in practice is the [SSW Clean Architecture template](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.CleanArchitecture). Its `AGENTS.md` file provides clear instructions on everything from the dependency flow to specific MediatR patterns.

    The `AGENTS.md` in SSW Clean Architecture includes:
    
    * **Architecture overview:** - Explaining the WebApi → Application → Domain flow
    * **Key patterns** - Clear C# examples for Commands, Queries, and Domain Events
    * **EF migrations** - The exact commands to use for database changes

As your project grows, so will your AGENTS.md. Read on to learn how to tackle the scaling problem.

## Even better: multiple AGENTS.md

You might be thinking: “Wait.. I have a massive monorepo. There's no way it's efficient to capture all that information in one file, and feed it into the AI in one go…”

Correct. It's unwise to just dump all of that context into the AI, if it is only going to find 5% of it useful.

This is where hierarchy comes in. As per the standard, Agents will only read the nearest AGENTS.md file, meaning you can stratify your documentation.

Place another `AGENTS.md` file inside each package. Agents will automatically read the nearest file in the directory tree, so the closest one takes precedence and every subproject can have its own instructions.

The "root" `AGENTS.md` file in this case should contain only high-level instructions for what each package is for, and what the overall architecture is, as the detailed instructions will be in the package-specific `AGENTS.md` files.

    ```

    │   └── ...
    ```

## How to implement it

1. Create the file: Add `AGENTS.md` to the root of your repository.
2. Keep it updated: As your project evolves, ensure the instructions in `AGENTS.md` remain accurate.
3. ✅ Done! As `AGENTS.md` is a common standard, agents should automatically look for this if it exists.
