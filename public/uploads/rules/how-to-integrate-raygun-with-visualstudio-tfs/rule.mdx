TFS/VisualStudio.com is the source of truth for product development, so how do you get issues in RayGun into TFS? Thankfully there’s a built in integration that lets you do that.

<endIntro />

1. Under Integrations
2. Select Visual Studio Team Services
3. Connect to your TFS or VisualStudio.com instance

  figurePrefix="none"
  figure="Link RayGun with TFS/VisualStudio.com"
  src="/uploads/rules/how-to-integrate-raygun-with-visualstudio-tfs/raygun-integration-tfs-1.png"
/>


Now under the crash report, you have to option to create a PBI and link it to the crash report.


<imageEmbed

  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure="Create a new PBI or link to an existing PBI"
  src="/uploads/rules/how-to-integrate-raygun-with-visualstudio-tfs/raygun-integration-tfs-2.png"
/>


Now you can see which RayGun create reports have already been added to the backlog.
