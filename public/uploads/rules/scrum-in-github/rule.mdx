GitHub is an awesome place to manage your code, but initially it wasn't the easiest place to manage Scrum. Things improved in 2021 with GitHub Projects.

[GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/about-projects) lets you create Sprints and manage Issues (aka PBIs or Tasks) with far more power.

### Setting up

That's a tonne of awesome features....but it requires a bit of set up, follow these steps to get up and running:

1. Navigate to **Projects | Projects | New project**

   ![Figure: Create a new GitHub Project](updatednavigatetogithubprojects.png)

2. Now we have the option to create a project from a template or from blank. Here is a great template [[Template] GitHub Scrum](https://github.com/orgs/SSWConsulting/projects/42/views/1)

3. We now want to setup our Sprint iteration. Navigate to **Project Settings | Sprint | + Add Iteration**

4. You will see your new Sprint created with settings. Click on the field you wish to edit to modify - name it **Sprint ‘X’** and enter **Start on** date and **Duration**.

   ![Figure: Pick the name and the dates via the Iteration field options](githubeditsprint.png)

5. We can now navigate through the project via the **view bar**. This will provide us the different dashboards for seperate elements of our projects.

6. To modify a new view, select the down arrow next to the view name. This will allow you to customize views to your desired purpose.

   **Note**: To see the Sprints grouped, and the issues ordered by status, click the view drop down and select **group:Sprint** and **sort:Status-asc**
