You should format "Environment.NewLine" at the end of a line.

<endOfIntro />

```csharp
string message = "The database is not valid." + Environment.NewLine + "Do you want to upgrade it? ";
```

::: bad
Bad example - "Environment.NewLine" isn't at the end of the line
:::

```csharp
string message = "The database is not valid." + Environment.NewLine;
message += "Do you want to upgrade it? ";
```

::: good
Good example -  "Environment.NewLine" is at the end of the line
:::

```csharp
return string.Join(Environment.NewLine, paragraphs);
```

::: good
Good example - "Environment.NewLine" is an exception for String.Join\
