## Microsoft Certifications

Microsoft provides numerous certifications and training options to help you learn new skills, fill technical knowledge gaps, and prove your competence.

Certifications are broken up into Fundamentals, Role-based (Intermediate & Expert), and Specialty. Check the [Become Microsoft Certified poster](https://aka.ms/traincertposter) for details of exams required for each of the certifications, or [browse all certifications here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/browse/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-33518).

### All Other Exams

All other exams are useful, depending on your focus/interest in GitHub.

For a DevOps focus, try the [GitHub Actions exam](https://examregistration.github.com/certification/ACTIONS). This exam measures your ability to accomplish the following technical tasks: author and maintain workflows; consume workflows; author and maintain actions; manage GitHub Actions for the enterprise.

If AI is your thing, check out the [GitHub Copilot exam](https://examregistration.github.com/certification/COPILOT). This exam has a heavy emphasis on understanding GitHub Copilot plans and features, how the AI tool uses data, developer use cases, and privacy fundamentals and context exclusions.
