title: Do you not install Web Deploy from the Web Platform Installer?

You should not Install Web Deploy from the Web Platform Installer, but instead download the installation from the IIS website (http://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/web-deploy).

The reason for this is that the Web Platform Installer does not install all of the components required for continuous deployment, but the downloaded package does.
