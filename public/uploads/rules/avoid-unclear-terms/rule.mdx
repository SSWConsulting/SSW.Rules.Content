Be careful of misunderstanding across English variants.

It's important to avoid culturally specific language that may not translate well globally, especially when a company has international offices, employees, or clients.
  </>}

In the software world, acronyms like CI/CD or API can confuse non-technical people.

In the same way, some everyday Australian terms might be unclear to international readers. It’s important to use clear, globally understood language when working across regions.

For example, a “tip fee” in Australia means a rubbish disposal charge, but to an American audience, it may be misinterpreted as a service gratuity. Instead, it would be clearer to use the term "Waste removal".

## Use "Checked by" when you feel a confusion

You can’t train service providers or clients to avoid regional terms, so if a word or phrase causes miscommunication, make a [Checked by XXX](/checked-by-xxx) call and clarify things before sending an email.

## Other regional vocabulary differences

These are common English words that carry different meanings in different countries. While not all of them are strictly work-related, they often come up in professional or everyday conversations and can easily cause confusion across regions.
