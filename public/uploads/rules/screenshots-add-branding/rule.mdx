It is great when people use screenshots. You can communicate better by using screenshots with balloons and other visual elements (arrows, shapes, and highlights) instead of only text. [Read the benefits of using screenshots](/screenshots-avoid-walls-of-text).
We recommend you **define a standard style for your visual elements by changing the default colors and shapes according to your branding**.

See some examples of different visual elements under same branding:


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'Indicate someone to enter the mobile field. Do you use a red arrow?',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/screenshots-add-branding/screenshot1.png"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'Or do you like the red box?',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/screenshots-add-branding/screenshot2.png"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'Or do you like the yellow highlight?',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/screenshots-add-branding/screenshot3.png"
/>
