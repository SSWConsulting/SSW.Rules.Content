It is great when people use screenshots. You can communicate better by using screenshots with balloons and other visual elements (arrows, shapes, and highlights) instead of only text. [Read the benefits of using screenshots](/screenshots-avoid-walls-of-text).
  </>}
/>
We recommend you **define a standard style for your visual elements by changing the default colors and shapes according to your branding**.

See some examples of different visual elements under same branding:


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Indicate someone to enter the mobile field. Do you use a red arrow?",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/screenshots-add-branding/screenshot1.png"
/>



<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Or do you like the red box?",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/screenshots-add-branding/screenshot2.png"
/>



<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Or do you like the yellow highlight?",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/screenshots-add-branding/screenshot3.png"
