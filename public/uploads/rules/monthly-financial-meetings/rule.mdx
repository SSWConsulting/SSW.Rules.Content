Companies often lose sight of their financial health due to disorganized processes or lack of regular oversight. This can lead to missed opportunities, unnecessary spending, or even financial instability.

Monthly financial meetings help mitigate these risks by providing clarity, accountability, and actionable insights into your business's performance.

<endIntro />

In these meetings, key staff members should review the past month and look at forecasts for next month.

It is a good idea to split reporting responsibilities into two sections:

* **Sales Team** - Responsible for preparing sales reports, utilization metrics, and billable leaderboards
* **Accounting Team** - Responsible for generating financial reports, select KPIs, forecasting and trend analysis

## Pre-meeting preparation steps

Proper preparation is crucial to avoid delays and ensure accurate data is available for discussion.
