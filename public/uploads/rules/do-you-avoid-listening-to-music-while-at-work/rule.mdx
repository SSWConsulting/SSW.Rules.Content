Should we be listening to music at work? I've had the debate with numerous people and decided that, generally, you should avoid it.

<endIntro />

Regardless of whether it is AC/DC or DotNetRocks, music/podcasts should not be used in the workplace, especially using headphones, because:

- We want the team to work with each other, and we don't mind that they hear other conversations going on. Hopefully, if they hear about a problem they can fix quickly, they'll help each other out.
- It's been suggested that [multitasking lowers your ability to efficiently carry out a task](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-multi-tasking-myth/) by as much as 20%! (e.g. doing your task at hand along with listening to tunes)
- It can be anti-social - some people can shelter themselves
- It regularly leads to "oh, I love this song, you should hear it" which subsequently turns into a bigger distraction from work for multiple people

Others have said we are wrong with reasons like:

- _"It helps me give you 100% - since the office is noisy I can concentrate and I need to block out a noisy environment"_
  Isn't the music just creating an additional noise source?
- _"It helps me relax"_
  Yes, we love hearing a good song, for example, when Adam hears Robbie Williams' "Better man" it gets him pumped a bit and it has a positive effect on his state of mind. We are unconvinced it helps us program better.

* _"In an open office, headphones are not merely transmitters of sound, they are like ‘Do Not Disturb’ signs on a hotel room door."_
  In several open offices using a headphone seems to be encouraged as the most effective for productivity.

There is, however, a use for it being "background" music in some scenarios; like when you are doing time-consuming mindless stuff like fixing data, building VPCs/VMWare or waiting for long builds.
