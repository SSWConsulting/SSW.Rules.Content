SQL Server 2008 R2 Reporting Services comes with some great samples that will help get you started. Unfortunately, they aren't installed by default.
These samples include:

1. Report Project based on the Adventure Works 2008 R2 database
2. Report Builder Model based on the Adventure Works 2008 R2 database

Upon installing the samples successfully, you should see 3 folders (shown below) in your Report Manager.
