We want to keep clear and simple file structure in our solution. Never put any files other than images file in \images folder.

<endIntro />

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure="HTML file in \\Images Folder."
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-keep-images-folder-image-only/OnlyImageBad.gif"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Images only, clean \\Images folder."
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-keep-images-folder-image-only/OnlyImageGood.gif"
/>
