Distinguishing visited links is very helpful to show where users have been before. Visited links should still stand out but not as obvious as unvisited ones. This is default on most browsers, but after adding custom styling to your website, you may need to include it.

**Tip:** Give visited links a less saturated colour to give that "used" look.

Specifying style for visited links is very simple. Just add the HEX color code to your CSS file as per:

```css
a:visited {
  color: #xxxxxx;
}
```

**Warning:** Be careful not to overuse CSS attributes on visited links - a color change is enough.
