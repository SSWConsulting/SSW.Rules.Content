Sometimes the prospect is not ready at the end of the Initial Meeting to engage you for a Spec Review or ad-hoc work. Even if this is the case, it's really important you leave the meeting with a crystal clear future about the next stage and when that will be. Every prospect needs an intelligently scheduled follow-up activity.

So, at the end, ask the prospect:

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    
- "When would be a good time to meet next?" Oh I'm quite busy at the moment, I'll get back to you
- "Great, let me know when you can"
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

**Figure: Bad example: It's unlikely that a follow-up meeting will occur**

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    
- "When would be a good time to meet next?" Oh I'm quite busy at the moment, I'll get back to you
- "How about late next week?" Yes that could work
- "Does Thursday or Friday suit better?" Probably Friday
- "Great! How about Friday morning?" I've got a meeting all morning
- "No worries, well I've got a few meetings in the PM so let's book in for 3?" Sure, sounds good
- "Cool, I'll send through an appointment now. Feel free to let me know if you need to change it down the line."

**Figure: Good example: Leading the prospect to help find what time works for them, highlighting that you are busy and that they are not locked into the meeting**

This will ensure that the follow-up meeting or phone call gets a much better chance of happening... Basically, the prospect sets this up and will feel a certain indirect obligation.

The other way to schedule a follow-up is using [Followupthen](/do-you-follow-up-emails-effectively).
