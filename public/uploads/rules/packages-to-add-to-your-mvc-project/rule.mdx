<introEmbed
  body={<>
When you create a new MVC project in Visual Studio it is important to include the right packages from the start. This will make a solution more manageable and developers will be more efficient.
  </>}
/>
Adding old, obsolete or incorrect packages can lead to decreased performance, scope creep as new requirements are discovered and generally lead to projects suffering.

❌ Some technologies to **avoid** are:

* MVC Web Forms
* KnockoutJS
* AngularJS
* Gulp

When creating a new MVC project, we recommend you use the [Clean Architecture Template](/clean-architecture-get-started). This template not only gives you a great structure, but it also includes all the required packages.

✅ Some of the NuGet packages included:

* EntityFramework
* FluentValidation
* NSwag
* AutoMapper
* MediatR

✅ Some of the NPM packages included:

* Angular
* FontAwesome
* RxJs
* NgRx
* Bootstrap
* TypeScript
