Most enterprise applications require a database to store data. Once you have a database you need a way to manage the schema.

Entity Framework Code First Migrations allow you to update a database schema rather than recreate it from scratch. This is useful when you have a production database that you want to keep, but you want to make changes to the schema.

<endOfIntro />

## Database Schema Management Options

Managing database schemas effectively is crucial for the smooth operation and evolution of software applications. For more options to manage database schemas, see [the best tools for updating database schemas](/tools-database-schema-changes/).

## Configuring Entity Framework Code First Migrations

The following assumes you have an existing project with a database context, entities, and have already installed the EF Core nuget packages.

1. Install EF Core Tools

```bash
dotnet new tool-manifest
dotnet tool install dotnet-ef
```

2. Enable migrations

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
```

   This will create a migration file in your project. This file contains the code to create the database schema.

```cs
// Example of EF Core Migration in a .NET 8 project
public partial class AddUserTable : Migration
{
    protected override void Up(MigrationBuilder migrationBuilder)
    {
        migrationBuilder.CreateTable(
            name: "Users",
            columns: table => new
            {
                Id = table.Column<int>(nullable: false)
                    .Annotation("SqlServer:Identity", "1, 1"),
                Name = table.Column<string>(nullable: true)
            },
            constraints: table =>
            {
                table.PrimaryKey("PK_Users", x => x.Id);
            });
    }

    protected override void Down(MigrationBuilder migrationBuilder)
    {
        migrationBuilder.DropTable(
            name: "Users");
    }
}

```

3. Update database

```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

### Using Rider

If you struggle to remember the commands above, Rider has a great UI that makes creating migrations easy. This is especially useful when you have different projects for both startup and migrations.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={true}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Rider - EF Core Migrations",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/use-code-migrations/rider-ef-core.png"
/>


## Executing Entity Framework Code First Migrations

Once you have some migration, you'll then need to decide when these get run. Naively, developers will often run migrations during program start-up, but this is not recommended. Doing so can cause issues in a web farm environment, as well as cause unnecessary delays during start-up.

```csharp
var dbContext = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<EagleEyeDbContext>();
await dbContext.Database.MigrateAsync();
```
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Figure: Bad example - Running migrations manually during startup in `program.cs`",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


### Entity Framework Migration Bundles

A place to run migrations is during your CICD deployment pipeline.

```bash
dotnet ef migrations bundle --self-contained --force
.\efbundle.exe --connection {$ENVVARWITHCONNECTION}
```
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "Figure: Good example - Creating and executing a migration bundle during a CICD pipeline",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />



<asideEmbed
  variant="info"
  body={<>
    If an `appsettings.json` file can be found the connection string can be automatically picked up.
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>
