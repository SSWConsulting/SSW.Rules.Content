Having your clients as Instant Messenger contacts can improve your efficiency in project work. You can get a fast solution to road blocks and solve little problems quickly, as well as develop a better relationship!

<endIntro />

Of course any important chats should be [confirmed via email](/as-per-our-conversation-emails).

    Hey Simon,

I find having my clients available on Microsoft Teams is extremely useful.

Can I add you as a contact? I'll add the above email address, let me know if you use a different one.

Cheers,\
Ulysses Maclaren
