When we're speaking on the phone and taking down notes on your computer live is just a hell of a lot easier when you've got both of your hands-free so you can type away as you please. There's a simple solution - use headsets. With these not only can you type furiously with both hands but they're supposed to be a lot more ergonomically friendly.

Bluetooth headsets are preferred over direct audio input/output as they give you the freedom to move and can be connected to any device.
