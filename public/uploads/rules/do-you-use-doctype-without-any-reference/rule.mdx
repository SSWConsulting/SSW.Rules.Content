Since HTML5, DOCTYPE no longer requires a reference to a DTD. Back in HTML 4.01, The DTD links were used in to specify the rules for the markup language (Transitional, Strict, Frameset etc) so that the browsers render the content correctly. It's no longer necessary.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
```
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {

  figure: "Figure: Bad example – Old reference in DOCTYPE",

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {

} } />
