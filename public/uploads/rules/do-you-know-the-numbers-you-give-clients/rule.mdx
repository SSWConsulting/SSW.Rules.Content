When working on an hourly basis, you can confuse clients when sometimes you try to talk about a few hours here and a few hours here or there.

<endIntro />

Simply things and just give them these 3 numbers:

|

| $ Billed to date                    | \_\_$xx\_\_(accurate on Tuesday) |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Burndown Days Remaining             | \_\_8\_\_                        |
| Calendar Days Booked                | \_\_4days x 2\_\_                |
| Next meeting (for Review and Retro) |
