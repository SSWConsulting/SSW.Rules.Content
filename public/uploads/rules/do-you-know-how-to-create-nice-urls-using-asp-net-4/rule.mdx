There are a lot of reasons to have nice URLs for your website:

* Easy to remember
* Easy to navigate
* Better for search engines

    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good example – Nice clean URL, easy to remember, easy to guess where I am and good for search engines",

With ASP.NET 4 it is easy to create this URLs. The ASP.NET team includes routing features, known from the MVC web framework.

Add a route in Global.asax

```cs
protected void Application_Start(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    //RouteTable and PageRouteHandler are in System.Web.Routing
    RouteTable.Routes.Add("ProductRoute",
        new Route("products/{productname}",
        new PageRouteHandler("~/ssw/Products/ProdCategoryList.aspx")));
}
```

**Figure: Example on how to route ssw.com.au/products/\{everything} to ssw.com.au/ssw/Products/ProdCategoryList.aspx page**

**Note:** There is no dependency on the MVC framework in order to use this code.
**Note:** IIS7 has a module called [URL rewrite module](http://www.iis.net/learn/extensions/url-rewrite-module/using-the-url-rewrite-module) that can do this functionality without changing any code. Just a configuration of a "Rule" in the IIS Manager.
