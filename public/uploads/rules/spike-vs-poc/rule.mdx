  body={<>
In Agile development, both the terms "Spike" and "Proof of Concept (PoC)" are used to address uncertainty or gather information, but they are applied in slightly different contexts.
  </>}
/>
## Spike

Used for short-term, focused technical investigations to address uncertainties, explore specific problems, or gain better understanding of tasks. It is not intended for delivering complete features but for learning and decision-making.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

Used to demonstrate the feasibility or viability of a broader idea or concept. PoCs are more extensive than Spikes, involving the development of a partial, simplified version of a feature to validate technical feasibility before full-scale development.

### Key differences

#### Purpose

* **Spike** – Research technical challenges or uncertainties within a Sprint
* **PoC** – Demonstrate the feasibility of a solution or idea before committing to full development

#### Focus

* **Spike** – Focuses on investigation and learning (e.g., testing frameworks, understanding APIs)
* **PoC** – Focuses on proving whether a concept or approach can work in practice

#### Timeframe

* **Spike** – Short, time-boxed within a Sprint (usually a few hours to a few days)
* **PoC** – Typically spans a longer period as it's aimed at validating a broader concept

#### Outcome

* **Spike** – Results in knowledge or information (**not deliverables**) to guide future work
* **PoC** – Results in a prototype or partial implementation to demonstrate viability

#### Application

* **Spike** – Applied when there’s a technical unknown or a need for research during development
* **PoC** – Applied when evaluating whether a new idea, feature, or technology will succeed before fully investing in it

#### Team Involvement

* **Spike** – Primarily involves the development team to resolve technical uncertainties
* **PoC** – May involve multiple stakeholders (developers, designers, business) to validate the concept's viability

#### Risk Management

* **Spike** – Reduces technical risk by clarifying unknowns
* **PoC** – Reduces business risk by testing the feasibility of a solution before major investment

### Which one to choose?

The decision depends on the nature and scope of the uncertainty or exploration in the Agile development process.

Choose **Spike** for specific technical challenges or unknowns.

Use **Proof of Concept** to validate the feasibility of a larger solution or architecture.
