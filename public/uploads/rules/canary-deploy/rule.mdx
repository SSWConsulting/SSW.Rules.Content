<introEmbed
  body={<>
Canary deployments let you release new features or updates to a small group of users first, gather feedback, and reduce the risks of a global rollout. At SSW, we track all our canary testers, their onboarding dates, OS, test status, feedback, and environment in a single spreadsheet.

Using a structured spreadsheet ensures transparency and consistency, so no one is missed and feedback can be actioned quickly.

## Practical use case

**Scenario:** You’ve built a new feature and are eager to roll it out to everyone.


<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    **Execution:** You ask: _“Hi team, is anyone free to test the new feature?”_

**Outcome:** It’s unclear who will test, when they’ll start, and how feedback is documented.
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: "Bad example – No clear plan, no single source of truth, no tracked outcomes",
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
/>



<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    **Execution:** You maintain a single spreadsheet detailing:

1. **User** – Who is invited to test and when
2. **Date Onboarded** – The date they started testing
3. **Status** – “Test Passed,” “Test Failed,” or “changes requested”
4. **Mark /10** – Their rating of the experience (optional but helpful)
5. **OS** – Their operating system (Windows, Mac, etc.)
6. **Environment** – e.g. “Prod (Beta)” or “Prod”
7. **Notes** – Key feedback or suggestions

**Outcome:** Everyone knows who is next to test, what issues have been found, and what the next steps are.

## Steps to implement a canary spreadsheet

1. **Create your spreadsheet**

   * Include columns for _User_, _Date Onboarded_, _Status_, _Mark /10_, _OS_, _Environment_, and _Notes_
   * Store it in a central location (e.g. Microsoft 365, Google Sheets) accessible to all stakeholders, testers and developers
   * If relevant, feel free to add as many columns as needed

2. **Identify your canary testers**

   * Start with a small, diverse set of users
   * Include at least one “power user” who knows the system deeply and one “fresh perspective” user

3. **Onboard each tester**

   * Give them clear instructions (including any known limitations or the environment’s URLs)
   * Direct them to fill in or confirm their details in the spreadsheet

4. **Record feedback**

   * Ask each tester for a rating (Mark /10) and to log outcomes under Status (Test Passed, Test Failed, etc.)
   * Document any showstoppers or usability issues in **Notes**

5. **Iterate quickly**

   * If someone logs a “Test Failed,” address the issue before inviting more testers
   * If changes are requested, update the environment or instructions, then retest

6. **Go wider**

   * After successful canary feedback, roll out your feature to all users
   * Keep the spreadsheet as a living record of the rollout process

## Possible statuses

* **N/A** – Not started or not applicable yet
* **✅ Test Pass (with changes requested)** – Feedback is positive, with small tweaks needed
* **❌ Test Failed** – Showstopper or critical bug prevents completion

    **Tip:** Keep your spreadsheet pinned in Teams or Slack channels for easy access.

## Avoid confusion

A canary deployment spreadsheet is your single source of truth. If a tester isn’t responding or is blocked, assign another tester rather than stalling the rollout. Record these changes so it’s clear who tested and when.
