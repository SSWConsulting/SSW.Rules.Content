Raw SQL comes with risks but sometimes it is the best solution.
Using raw SQL involves taking care of SQL injection and other risks, however there are a number of situations where it may be the best solution.

The most obvious is a SQL UPDATE statement which updates a large number of rows.

```cs
await context.Database.ExecuteSqlInterpolatedAsync($"UPDATE Employees SET Active = {activeState}", ct);
```

  figure: 'Good example - Updating a large number of rows quickly with SQL',
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />
