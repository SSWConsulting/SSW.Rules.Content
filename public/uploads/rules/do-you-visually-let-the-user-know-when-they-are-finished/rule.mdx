seoDescription: Visual indications on the last page of a wizard help users confirm
  completion, enhancing their experience.
title: Do you visually let the user know when they are finished?
type: rule

When a user reaches the last page of a wizard, a visual indication should be provided so that they know that the process has finished. We use a finish flag to do this.
