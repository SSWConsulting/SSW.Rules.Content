### When to use checkboxes in UI design

Checkboxes are used in forms to indicate an answer to a question, apply a batch of settings or allow the user to make a multi-selection from a list. Alternatively, a single checkbox may be used for making single selections – such as Boolean True or False statements (e.g. “Do you agree with the terms and conditions? Yes or no”).

  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: 'Good example - Accepting or refusing to remember accounts when login to SugarLearning (the single selection checkbox)',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/control-choice-do-you-know-when-to-use-checkboxes/sugarlearning-rememberme.png"
/>

CheckBoxes are also suitable to use for enable or disable sections and to tell the user that these sections do not need configuring for the application to run.

<imageEmbed

  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: 'Good example - CheckBoxes are used to setup the approval workflow in SugarLearning, only need to enter the approv when the checkbox is checked',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/control-choice-do-you-know-when-to-use-checkboxes/sugarlearning-approval.png"
/>

Checkboxes allow the user to select one or more from a wide range of options. Applications use a series of checkbox groups to help the user filter search criteria.

<imageEmbed

  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: 'Good example - Booking.com’s users frequently use the checkbox filters when making a booking',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/control-choice-do-you-know-when-to-use-checkboxes/bookingsites.png"
/>

If there are only 2 options available on the form (usually a **yes/no** answer), the use of a checkbox is more intuitive than radio buttons. Usually, use radio buttons if there are more than 2 options; or if the labels information are more complex than a yes/no.

### When to use options group Radio Buttons instead of ComboBox?

When the options are static items (not database driven) and they can fit on the screen (about 2-5 items), they should be radio buttons.

The bad thing about having a ComboBox in this scenario is the user needs 2 clicks to change the value...

1. Click the little "v" button to see the available options
2. Then click the option to select

  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: 'Bad example - ComboBox is used for "Job Type" where it contains only 2 options',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/control-choice-do-you-know-when-to-use-checkboxes/notusingradiobuttons.gif"
/>

The good thing about an options group is that the user can see all the available options without clicking, and select the option with just 1 click.

    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
