It's important to provide a physical space for each employee to store their stuff and as a bonus they can also receive packages and mail. Lockers should:

<endIntro />

- Be clearly labelled with the staff members name
- Ideally, should have a slot for mail
- Ideally should be half-height so you can hang a shirt or a jacket
- Encourage the goal of a clean desk policy
- Encourage the chucking of paper - it should not be a place to keep all of your scraps of papers. Paper tends to get lost and should be transferred to tasks as 'To Myself' emails and then chuck. See [Rules to better Email](/rules-to-better-email) for more information.
