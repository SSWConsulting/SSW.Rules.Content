Every time you add an image to your content, make sure it:

<!--endintro-->

* Has at least 800px width (except for logos, icons, and profile images)
* Is readable if it has any text on it
* Looks consistent with others on the same page
* (optional) Is not in dark-mode - Light background images look better most of the times
