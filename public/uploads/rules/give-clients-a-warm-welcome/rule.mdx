* Be dressed appropriately
* Greet them warmly
* Have a firm handshake
* Make eye contact and smile
* Direct them to wait in the waiting area (so they can learn about the company through our tv screens)
* Notify the project manager/developers who are included in the meeting
* Ask someone to bring a couple of glasses of water into the meeting (as everyone drinks water)
* Join the meeting in the boardroom:
  * Show some enthusiasm when meeting with the client
  * Hand over, and collect, business cards - (organize in front of you, to help you remember their names)
  * Use their names a few times early on to help you remember their name
