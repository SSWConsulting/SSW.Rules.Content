seoDescription: Prefix SQL stored procedure names with the owner to improve performance
  and avoid ambiguity when using ADO.NET.
title: Do you always prefix SQL stored procedure names with the owner in ADO.NET code?
type: rule
uri: do-you-always-prefix-sql-stored-procedure-names-with-the-owner-in-ado-net-code
---

Stored procedure names in code should always be prefixed with the owner (usually dbo). This is because if the owner is not specified, SQL Server will look for a procedure with that name for the currently logged on user first, creating a performance hit.

```dotnet
SqlCommand sqlcmd = new SqlCommand(); sqlcmd.CommandText = "
                    proc_InsertCustomer" sqlcmd.CommandType
                    = CommandType.StoredProcedure; sqlcmd.Connection = sqlcon;
```
**❌ Bad example**  

```dotnet
SqlCommand sqlcmd = new SqlCommand(); sqlcmd.CommandText = "
                     dbo.proc_InsertCustomer"; sqlcmd.CommandType
                     = CommandType.StoredProcedure; sqlcmd.Connection = sqlcon;
```
**✅ Good example**  

We have a program called [SSW Code Auditor](https://codeauditor.com/) to check for this rule.
