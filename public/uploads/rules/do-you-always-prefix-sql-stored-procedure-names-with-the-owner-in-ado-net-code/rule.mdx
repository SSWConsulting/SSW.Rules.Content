<introEmbed
  body={<>
Stored procedure names in code should always be prefixed with the owner (usually dbo). This is because if the owner is not specified, SQL Server will look for a procedure with that name for the currently logged on user first, creating a performance hit.
  </>}
/>
```dotnet
SqlCommand sqlcmd = new SqlCommand(); sqlcmd.CommandText = "
                    proc_InsertCustomer" sqlcmd.CommandType
                    = CommandType.StoredProcedure; sqlcmd.Connection = sqlcon;
```

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Bad example",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


```dotnet
SqlCommand sqlcmd = new SqlCommand(); sqlcmd.CommandText = "
                     dbo.proc_InsertCustomer"; sqlcmd.CommandType
                     = CommandType.StoredProcedure; sqlcmd.Connection = sqlcon;
```

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "Good example",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


We have a program called [SSW Code Auditor](https://codeauditor.com/) to check for this rule.
