In today’s world almost every conversation happens online, and recording a Teams call without telling everyone on it is more than just poor etiquette, it’s a breach of trust and, in many cases, a legal risk.

People have a reasonable expectation of privacy in discussions, and being caught recording them without their knowledge can damage relationships, harm your reputation, and even expose the business to privacy violations. In Australia and many other regions, laws and workplace privacy principles treat unannounced recording of private conversations as a serious issue, sometimes even an offence, unless everyone involved is aware and agrees to it upfront.

Consent isn’t just a checkbox, it shows respect, builds trust, and avoids awkward or harmful situations later if a recording is shared or referenced. Recording with transparency protects your team, your clients, and your credibility.

## Respect

Always ask everyone on the call for permission before you hit “Record.” Recording without consent undermines trust, makes people uncomfortable, and creates a culture where team members feel surveilled rather than supported. Trust is foundational to collaboration — recording in secret erodes it.  ￼

## Credibility

How you handle recordings reflects on you and the company. Secret recordings feel like a breach of integrity and can damage your professional reputation. People need to feel safe to speak candidly, fear of being recorded can make meetings guarded, stifling open communication and productivity.

    Transparent communication builds credibility. Always state why you want the recording, how it will be used, and ideally, even who will have access unless it's obvious.

## Legality

Recording calls without consent can expose you and the organisation to legal risk. In many parts of Australia, recording private conversations without everyone’s consent can be unlawful or carry penalties (see [Surveillance Devices Act 2004](https://www.legislation.gov.au/C2004A02124/latest/text)).

Some jurisdictions allow one-party consent, but even where it’s technically legal, publishing or sharing the recording without consent is restricted and risky. See the [OAIC guide on consent](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/your-privacy-rights/your-personal-information/consent-to-the-handling-of-personal-information) for more details.

    Assume you need informed consent for all call recordings. Make it a standard practice to announce before recording. When in doubt, don’t record.

### Summary

Respect people’s privacy, protect your credibility, and avoid legal trouble, always ask for consent before recording a Teams call.
