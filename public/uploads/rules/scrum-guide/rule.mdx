Everyone who will be involved in Scrum (pigs and chickens alike) should have read and understood the Scrum guide.

Understanding the concepts of Scrum is easy... implementing it is hard!

Everyone should:

1. Read the [Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html).
2. Take the [Scrum Open assessment](https://www.scrum.org/open-assessments/scrum-open) and get at least 85% to be “Certified Scrum 1”
3. Watch the awesome video:
