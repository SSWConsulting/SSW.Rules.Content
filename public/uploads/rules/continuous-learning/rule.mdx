type: rule
uri: continuous-learning

Technology is a fluid industry, with new tools and techniques being developed all the time. To stay ahead of the curve, it is important to continuously learn and improve your skills. This can be done through a variety of methods, such as attending conferences, reading books, watching videos, and participating in online courses.
Companies should encourage their employees to continuously learn by providing them with the resources and opportunities to do so.

An example of this is SSW's Chewing the Fat. This is a weekly Microsoft Form that is sent out to all employees educating them on a new topic. This is a great way to keep employees up to date with the latest technologies and trends.
It is also an opportunity for employees to share their knowledge and ideas to help improve the company.

SSW also gets employees to do at least one induction item per week until there are none left.
