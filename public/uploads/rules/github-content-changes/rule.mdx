Some websites use GitHub to manage their content (e.g. [SSW Rules](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Rules.Content)). GitHub makes reviewing changes easy through "Pull Requests".

A Pull Request is a request to make changes to 1 or more files. GitHub provides out of the box functionality for reviewing changes in a pull request. This process is as follows:

<endIntro />

1. Open the Pull Request
2. Examine the changes using the tabs:
   * **Conversations:** Comments people have made about the change
   * **Commits:** Summary of the changes the requester has made
   * **Checks:** You can ignore this if you are not a developer
   * **Important - Files changed:** See the difference between the old and new files being changed. Red highlighting indicates deleted parts and green highlighting indicates added parts.
     This visual preview of the changes to a markdown file is accessed via **Files changed | Display the rich diff**

3. Approve OR ask for changes

   a. Go to **Files changed | Review changes**
    b. Select an option:

   * Choose "Approve" to mark it as ready to go live
     Add a comment with feedback (if necessary)
   * Choose "Comment" for general feedback when PR it's not ready for approval
   * Choose "Request changes" for mandatory changes to the PR

   c. Press "Submit review" so that the requester can see it
