The bigger your prompts get, the more challenging they become for the AI to understand.

Using  Markdown or XML tags will help an LLM parse your prompts more accurately, leading to higher-quality outputs.

The best part is that it doesn't need to follow any specific syntax. It just helps both humans and AI to have structured prompts.
## Why use Markdown or XML tags?

* **Clarity** - Ensure your prompt is well structured by having clear separation of different parts
* **Accuracy** - Reduce the 'needle-in-a-haystack' problem by being more explicit
* **Flexibility** - Easily re-arrange, add, remove, and locate different parts of your prompt by having everything atomic

You can even ask the LLM to give outputs in XML, which makes things easier to read for humans too!
