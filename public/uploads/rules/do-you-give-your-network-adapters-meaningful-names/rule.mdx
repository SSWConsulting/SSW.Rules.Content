seoDescription: Give your network adapters meaningful names to simplify Hyper-V Clustering
  configuration and ensure smooth node operations.
title: Do you give your Network Adapters meaningful names?
type: rule
uri: do-you-give-your-network-adapters-meaningful-names
---

When you configure Hyper-V Clustering, each node will have upwards of 4 network adapters, some virtual and some physical. It is important to give these adapters meaningful names so you know what network adapter does what.
