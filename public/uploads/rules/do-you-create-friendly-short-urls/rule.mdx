When you create short URLs, it is worth considering exactly why you are shortening it.

Is it for space or readability? If it is for readability or you expect anyone to ever type it in, then consider making a friendly short URL.

I want to be able to type this URL in, but it is VERY long:

<boxEmbed

  body={<>

  </>}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure="People can’t easily type this URL in... it is too long"
/>

<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    Thanks Rob, that is great.
    Made a bit.ly at http\://bit.ly/aC5Lb2
  </>}
  figurePrefix="ok"
  figure="Short URL, but how will people remember that?"
/>
