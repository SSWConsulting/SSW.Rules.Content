You can get email list in ExtensionSettings, which is an XML column in Subscriptions table in database of reporting services. Subscriptions table has a FK with Catalog table, which contains report name and report path information. Then we can XQuery the ExtensionSettings to get TO and CC fields according to report name and report path.
  </>}
/>
See the following example. You need to fill report name and report path parameters(@mReportName and @mReportPath). Then this example will return the email dataset of the report's subscriptions.

    FETCH NEXT FROM xmlCursor INTO @settingsXML
END
SELECT toEmail, ccEmail, Comment FROM #subscrpt
DROP TABLE #subscrpt
CLOSE xmlCursor
DEALLOCATE xmlCursor
