Many teams jump into every tender opportunity they see, thinking that more bids = more wins. In reality, this scattergun approach spreads your team thin, results in poor-quality submissions, and burns time and energy on opportunities you were never going to win.

Instead, adopt a Bid/No Bid process to deliberately pause and assess whether a tender is genuinely worth pursuing. This approach improves win rates, aligns teams, and protects delivery quality and company reputation.

### Why use a Bid/No Bid process?

The goal isn’t to say “no” more often — it’s to say “yes” to the right opportunities:

* Focus effort on bids you can realistically win and deliver
* Align teams early and reduce internal churn
* Improve quality and win probability of submissions
* Avoid wasting time on misaligned, risky, or low-impact tenders\:contentReference\[oaicite:0]{index=0}

### The 4 key questions to ask

Before proceeding with any tender, your Bid/No Bid process should answer these gating questions:

1\. Is the opportunity real?

2\. Do we genuinely want it?

3\. Can we win it?

4\. Can we deliver it successfully?

If you can’t confidently answer “yes” to all four, you should walk away — and that’s a win too.

### The 3 C’s: Customer, Competition, Capability

Use these 3 criteria as the backbone of your assessment:

#### 1. Customer

Do you truly understand what the customer needs — beyond just what's in the RFT?

* Have you engaged with the client before?
* Can you influence or tailor your solution to them?
* Is there enough trust and credibility to win?

If you can't build trust or demonstrate alignment, it’s not worth bidding.

#### 2. Competition

You should know who else is bidding and how you compare:

\* Are competitors better positioned?

\* Do you have a compelling, meaningful differentiator?

\* Will your differentiator genuinely matter to this client?

If you don’t stand out in a way that resonates with the buyer, you're playing from behind.

#### 3. Capability

It’s not just about technical skills — consider:

* Do you have the delivery capacity and relevant experience?
* Will you need to hire or partner to fill gaps?
* Will pursuing this overextend your team or compromise quality?

If you can't deliver well, don’t bid. A win you can't deliver is worse than a loss.

### Good vs Bad Example

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    Your team receives a tender on Friday due Monday. It’s for a major project with a new client you’ve never worked with. You haven’t scoped the work, don’t know who else is bidding, and would need to borrow people from delivery to respond.

\::: bad

Figure: Bad Example – Jumping in without alignment, preparation, or a realistic chance to win

Your team reviews a new tender using a Bid/No Bid checklist. The opportunity is aligned with your strengths, your team has pre-engaged with the client, you understand their drivers, and you have a strong differentiator. You allocate the right team to develop a tailored response.

\::: good

Figure: Good Example – A deliberate, informed decision leads to a stronger submission and better win probability

### Final thoughts

Bidding should be strategic — not reactive. 

By applying a disciplined Bid/No Bid process, you’ll save time, improve team morale, and dramatically increase your win rate. Remember:

\> Winning more is not about bidding more. It's about bidding better — with intent, clarity, and confidence.
