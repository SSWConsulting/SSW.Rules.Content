It's frustrating when you're in the middle of a project and need a reliable plumber, electrician, or handyman - but can't remember who you used last time or where their details went. Valuable time gets wasted searching emails, texts, or asking around again.

When you find a great service provider, especially in trades, make sure you record their details in a central location and share them with your team. These professionals are often busy and booked weeks in advance, so having quick access to trusted contacts can make or break a deadline.

## What details should you capture?

At a minimum, store the following:

* Full name
* Company name
* Phone number and email
* Specialty/trade (e.g. "bathroom waterproofing" or "split system installs")
* General availability (e.g. "only available weekdays after 3pm")
* Notes (e.g. "Always arrives early. Takes card payments.")

## Where should you store it?

Store in a **shared location** such as:

* A dedicated Teams OneNote or SharePoint list
* A shared CRM or internal wiki
* A recurring calendar note with the supplier's contact attached

Avoid storing them in personal devices, unshared email threads, or private notes - these are easy to lose and inaccessible to others.

**✅ Figure: Good example – Contact details are stored clearly and include job history and availability**  

## Keep your list current

Every time you need assistance, do a quick check that:

* The provider is still in business
* Their contact details are up to date
* They’re still your preferred choice (quality or pricing may have changed)

If you replace a provider, note why (e.g. pricing too high, quality dropped), so others don't revert to old habits.

Having a reliable, up-to-date list of service providers improves project flow, reduces stress, and helps new team members onboard faster.
