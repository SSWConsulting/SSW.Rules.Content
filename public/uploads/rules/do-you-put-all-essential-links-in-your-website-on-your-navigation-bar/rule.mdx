There are certain links on a website which you want to make VERY simple for users to find. I hate hunting around on a site for a phone numbers. These are the basics which should be easily accessible from every page:

- Home page (top left corner)
- Contact Us (with a phone number, not a form.submit!)
- News (especially for journalists)
- Directions (so prospects and clients can come and
  visit!)
