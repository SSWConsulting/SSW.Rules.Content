Defining your intent clearly in a prompt is crucial for helping ChatGPT understand your goal and provide an appropriate response. When the model has a clear understanding of what you're asking, it's more likely to deliver the information or assistance you're seeking.

<endOfIntro />

Here are some tips for defining your intent in prompts:

- Be explicit about what you want ChatGPT to do or the type of information you're seeking
- If your request has multiple components, break them down into separate parts within the prompt
- Ensure your intent is evident even to someone with minimal background knowledge


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    "Can you tell me something about climate change?"
  </>}
  captionStyle="badExample"
  captionText={"Bad example - The prompt is unclear and doesn't define the intent"}
/>



<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    "What are the primary human activities contributing to climate change and their impacts on the environment?"
  </>}
  captionStyle="goodExample"
  captionText={"Good example - the prompt clearly defines the intent by asking for specific information"}
/>



<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    "My goal is to reduce my household's energy consumption. Can you suggest five practical steps I can take to achieve this while still maintaining a comfortable living environment?"

  </>}
  captionStyle="default"
  captionText={""}
/>
**✅ Figure: Good example - the prompt clearly states the user's goal and asks for specific information to help achieve it, making it easier for ChatGPT to understand the desired outcome and provide relevant suggestions**  

By always defining your intent in your prompts, you can improve the quality of ChatGPT's responses and increase the likelihood of receiving the information or assistance you need.
