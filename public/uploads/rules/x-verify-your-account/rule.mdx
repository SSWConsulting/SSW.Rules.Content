X lets anyone pay for a verified account (the blue tick goes public). This lets other people know that someone is verified as a real person who is paying for their account.

<endOfIntro />

As outlined on the X website:

## Request to verify an account

The blue verified badge on X lets people know that an account is authentic.

We recommend accounts maintained by users in **music, acting, fashion, government, politics, religion, journalism, media, sports, business, and other key interest areas** to apply to be verified on Twitter. Accounts that are not verified are promoted less than those that are (this is to reduce the power of bots).

## Getting verified

To have a verified accound, your account must have the following:

* A verified phone number
* A confirmed email address
* A bio
* A profile photo
* A header photo
* A birthday (for accounts that are not a company, brand, or organization accounts)
* A website
* Tweets set as public in Tweet privacy settings
* Profile and account recommendations

Some common characteristics of verified accounts include:

* If the account belongs to a person, the name reflects the real or stage name of the person.
* If the account is a corporation or company account, the name reflects the real name of the corporation or company.
* The profile and/or header photo reflects the person, the corporation’s branding, or the company’s branding.
* If the account is a corporate or company account, the email address associated with the account is a corporate or company email address.
