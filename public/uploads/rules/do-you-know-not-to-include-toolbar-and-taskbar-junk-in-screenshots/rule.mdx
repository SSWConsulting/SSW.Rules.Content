Screenshots are a very important part of websites these days. Ensure they are clean and free of distractions like browser tabs, toolbars, debug windows, and taskbars.
<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: 'Bad example - Screenshot includes personal tabs, toolbar, debug window, and taskbar',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-not-to-include-toolbar-and-taskbar-junk-in-screenshots/bad-screenshot-with-personal-data.png"
/>

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: 'Good example - Screenshot has been cropped to hide junks',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-not-to-include-toolbar-and-taskbar-junk-in-screenshots/good-no-personal-info.png"
/>

Tips:

* Use a region screen shot if appropriate (however the URL is generally helpful in most browser screenshots)
* Go full screen
* Always have the 'Auto-hide the taskbar' option checked
