Screenshots are a very important part of websites these days. Ensure they are clean and free of distractions like browser tabs, toolbars, debug windows, and taskbars.

Tips:

* Use a region screen shot if appropriate (however the URL is generally helpful in most browser screenshots)
* Go full screen
* Always have the 'Auto-hide the taskbar' option checked

    Done Videos are an exception – it’s fine to include the full screen. See [Do you know how to record a quick and dirty 'Done Video'?](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/done-video/)
