Basically, creating a rule category contains two parts of work.

1. Create a "rule category" in Term Store (e.g. "Rules to Better xxx")
2. Create a "rule summary" page to show all the rule pages belong to this rule category

**1. Create a "rule category" in Term Store (e.g. "Rules to Better xxx")**

1. Open browser, log in to /admin

2) Open termstoremanager, under "ImportTaxonomy" | "RuleCategories", find the right "parent category" (e.g. "Communication"), click "Create Term":
   ![](/uploads/rules/how-to-create-a-rule-category/rulecategor1.jpg)

3) Type the rule category name, e.g. "Rules to Better xxx":
   ![](/uploads/rules/how-to-create-a-rule-category/rulecategor2.jpg)

**2. Create a "rule summary" page to show rule pages belong to this rule category**

1. Go to "Site Setting" | "Add a page" to create a new page:
   ![](/uploads/rules/how-to-create-a-rule-category/rulecategor3.jpg)

2. Type the rule category name in the popup dialog (same as the rule category name created in term store, e.g. "Rules to Better xxx"), then click "Create" button:

  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  captionStyle="default"
  caption={"a friendly url will be automatically generated"}
  src="/uploads/rules/how-to-create-a-rule-category/rulecategor4.jpg"
/>


3. On the new created page, go to "Ribbon" | "Page" | "Page Layout" to change the new created page layout to be "SSW - Rule Summary Page":

![](/uploads/rules/how-to-create-a-rule-category/rulecategor5.jpg)

4. "Check in" and "Publish" this "Rule Summary" page, then you should have a page like below,


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  captionStyle="default"
  caption={"Any futher created \"rule pages\" belong to this \"rule category\" will be listed on this page"}
  src="/uploads/rules/how-to-create-a-rule-category/rulecategor6.jpg"
/>
