2. Send out an email notifying all users that TFS2008 will be turned off.
   Follow [Do you have a server reboot/restart policy?](/planned-outage-process)

   A. Running [TFSQuiesce](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/server/command-line/tfsservicecontrol-cmd?view=azure-devops-2022#parameters) (recommended)
