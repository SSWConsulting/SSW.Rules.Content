In order to get better clarity on what work is done, it's a good idea to connect your PBI's and tasks to the commits, branches and pull requests that relate to the item. All commits, branches and pull requests should be linked to a PBI.

  figure: '![Bad Example: No linked commit\'s, branches or pull requests](no-linked-commit.png)',
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: '![Good Example: Git branch linked to PBI in TFS](link-branch-to-pbi.png)',
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />

Note: If you create your branches through Azure DevOps then you can link them during creation.

  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


Here is a handy resource for linking work items:

Note: You can setup Branch Policies on your main branches to enforce this behaviour.

} } />
