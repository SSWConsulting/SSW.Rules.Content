Leading questions can result in biased or unhelpful answers from ChatGPT. To obtain objective and useful responses, it's important to ask open-ended, unbiased questions that allow the model to explore a topic without being influenced by the phrasing of the prompt.

<endOfIntro />

Here are some tips for avoiding leading questions:

* Use neutral language that doesn't imply a specific answer or point of view
* Focus on asking questions that encourage exploration and elaboration
* Avoid making assumptions or expressing your opinions within the question itself

/>
