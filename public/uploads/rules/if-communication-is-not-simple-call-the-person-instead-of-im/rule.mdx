When you realize the communication is not simple and there it is going to take much back and forth IMs, say "Can I call?" and continue the conversation through voice.

Communication using voice is much faster than typing a message and it can clear misunderstandings. Encourage people to switch to voice if possible.

Example:

  body={<>
    **Scott:**  Did you say to me, you would contact Mike on Teams to do it collaboratively... rather than email?

**Dave:**  I agreed I'll contact them over Teams as suggested by Sophie

**Scott:**  Isn't that what I just said? (and you said you were sending emails)

**Dave:**  Hold on... I don't understand you anymore, ==can we switch to voice?==
