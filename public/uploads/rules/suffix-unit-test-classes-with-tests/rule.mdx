Unit test classes should be suffixed with the word "Tests" for better coding readability.

<endIntro />

```csharp
[TestFixture] public class SqlValidatorReportTest { }
```
**❌ Bad example - Unit test class is not suffixed with "Tests"**  

```csharp
[TestFixture] public class HtmlDocumentTests { }
```
**✅ Good example - Unit test class is suffixed with "Tests"**  

We have a program called [SSW Code Auditor](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/) to check for this rule.
