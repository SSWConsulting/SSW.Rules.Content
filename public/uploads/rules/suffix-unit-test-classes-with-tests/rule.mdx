Unit test classes should be suffixed with the word "Tests" for better coding readability.
  </>}
/>
```csharp
[TestFixture] public class SqlValidatorReportTest { }
```

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Bad example - Unit test class is not suffixed with \"Tests\"",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


```csharp
[TestFixture] public class HtmlDocumentTests { }
```

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "Good example - Unit test class is suffixed with \"Tests\"",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


We have a program called [SSW Code Auditor](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/) to check for this rule.
