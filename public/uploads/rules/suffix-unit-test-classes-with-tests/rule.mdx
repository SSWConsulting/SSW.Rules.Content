```csharp
[TestFixture] public class SqlValidatorReportTest { }
```
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Bad example - Unit test class is not suffixed with \"Tests\"",
  shouldDisplay: true

We have a program called [SSW Code Auditor](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/) to check for this rule.
