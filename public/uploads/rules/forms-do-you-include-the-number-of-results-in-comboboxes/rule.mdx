When designing your form, you should try to help your user whenever it's possible. So it's a good idea to include the number of results in ComboBoxes.
<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: 'Good example â€“ combo-box with multiple columns',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
