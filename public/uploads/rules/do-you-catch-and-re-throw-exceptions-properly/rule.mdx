A good catch and re-throw will make life easier while debugging, a bad catch and re-throw will ruin the exception's stack trace and make debugging difficult.

Catch and rethrow where you can usefully add more information that would save a developer having to work through all the layers to understand the problem.

```cs
catch {}

catch (SomeException) {}

catch { throw; }

catch (SomeException) { throw; }
```

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Bad Example - Never use an empty catch block. Do something in the block or remove it.",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


```cs
catch (SomeException ex) { throw ex; }

catch (SomeException ex) { someMethod(); throw ex; }
```

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Bad Example - Never re-throw exceptions by passing the original exception object. Wrap the exception or use throw.",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


Using `throw ex` resets the stack trace, obscuring the original the error and may hide highly valuable information to debug this exception.

```cs
catch (SomeException)
{
     someMethod();
     throw;
}
```

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "Good Example - Calling throw",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


If you are following the [Clean Architecture](https://github.com/jasontaylordev/CleanArchitecture) pattern - catching and rethrowing is useful for preventing your Infrastructure details from leaking into your Application e.g. we use a SQL server

```cs
catch (SqlException ex) when (ex.Number == 2601)
{
     throw new IdAlreadyTakenException(ex);
}
```

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "Good Example - By rethrowing a specific exception, my application code now doesn't need to know that there is a SQL database or the magic numbers that SQL exceptions use",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />
