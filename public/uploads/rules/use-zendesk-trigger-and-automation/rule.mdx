As a Zendesk user, harnessing the power of triggers and automation is key to enhancing your customer support experience. Effective use of these features can streamline your workflow, ensure timely responses, and improve overall customer satisfaction.

<endIntro />

Zendesk triggers and automation are powerful tools for managing and responding to tickets efficiently. Triggers are business rules that run immediately after tickets are created or updated. Automations, on the other hand, are rules that perform actions after a certain period.

Please see the following [video from SweetHawk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhTFE8xgu2g) for more information:

Examples of triggers that can be used:

- When your CEO emails Zendesk, remove the group notification - let the CEO CC whoever he wants to see in the email, this means less email noise 🔉
- If an email is sent to a particular email address, make it Urgent ⚠️

### Why Use Triggers and Automation?

- **Efficiency**: Automate routine tasks, saving time for your team.
- **Consistency**: Ensure a uniform response to common ticket scenarios.
- **Timeliness**: Respond to tickets promptly, even outside business hours.

### How to Use Triggers and Automation in Zendesk

1. **Creating a Trigger**

   - Navigate to `Admin` > `Business Rules` > `Triggers`.
   - Click `Add Trigger`.
   - Define the conditions and actions for the trigger. For instance, send an email to a customer when their ticket is received.

2. **Setting Up Automation**

   - Go to `Admin` > `Business Rules` > `Automations`.
   - Click `Add Automation`.
   - Set conditions that must be met over time. For example, notify your customer if a ticket remains pending, without a reply from them, for 48 hours.
