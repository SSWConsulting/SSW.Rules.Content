An ATS (Applicant Tracking System) is a way in which you can track your candidates during your recruitment process. It can be as simple as a Trello board, or a custom designed system. There are a lot of options on the market, some of the more popular ones are:

- LinkedIn Talent Hub
- Greenhouse
- Lever
- Workable
- Beamery
- Jobadder

If you are a small company, you might get away with using something simple, like a Trello board, or you could simply use the built-in recruitment funnels in Seek or LinkedIn. However, if you need data to test the efficiency and cost of your recruitment, or if you need to integrate your ATS with a database, we recommend that you use a custom ATS, like LinkedIn Hub.

Advantages of using LinkedIn Talent Hub:

- You can track your candidates throughout the recruitment process.
- You can add candidates directly from LinkedIn Recruiter, applications, or import them from elsewhere.
- It automatically looks for a LinkedIn profile for imported resumes.
- You can export their details to another ATS if you decide to change without a lot of manual data entry.
- You can make notes about your candidates, so that if you speak to 10 people in a row, you can remember their strengths and weaknesses and also rank them in order of preference.
- You can share a candidate’s details with other members of staff without the need to move data or download a resume.
- You can customise the recruitment funnel to reflect your own process
- You can send candidates emails or InMail’s directly from LinkedIn Hub
- It integrates with Outlook so that you can invite candidates or interviewers via an appointment and view your calendar.
- It has reporting services that you can use to analyse your recruitment process and implement improvements based upon your recruitment data.
