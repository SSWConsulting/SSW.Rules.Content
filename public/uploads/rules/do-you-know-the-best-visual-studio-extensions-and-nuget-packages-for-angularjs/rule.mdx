Following this rule will ensure the right NuGet packages and Visual Studio Extensions are included in your projects to help speed up your development, follow best practices and have the team using the same processes.
  </>}
/>
The best NuGet packages are:

- [Angular.UI.Bootstrap](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Angular.UI.Bootstrap)
  Check out the whole suite of tools from the [Angular UI](https://angular-ui.github.io/) team.

- [AngularJS.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AngularJS.Core/)
  This core package only has the minimum Angular references to get started. Other Angular packages like [AngularJS.Route](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AngularJS.Route/) can be added as needed in addition to this.

- [AngularJS](https://www.nuget.org/packages/angularjs)
  The whole AngularJS library.

- [HotTowel.Angular](https://www.nuget.org/packages/HotTowel.Angular/)
  John Papa's popular AngularJS Single Page Application (SPA) template.

- [Side Waffle](https://github.com/ligershark/side-waffle)
  Templates for common AngularJS components like controllers, factories, and modules.

Alternate sources for Angular Modules:

- [NgModules](https://angular.io/guide/ngmodules)
  Modules are a great way to organize an application and extend it with capabilities from external libraries.
