The template is an implementation of Clean Architecture in a .NET Web API. It includes a full implementation of CA covering testing, validation and many other topics.

To set up this template, follow the steps in the [project README | Getting Started](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.CleanArchitecture?tab=readme-ov-file#-getting-started).
