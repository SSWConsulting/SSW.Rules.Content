Whenever you're doing something more than once there should be a clear procedure. We call them “standards” or “rules”. That means that there should be lots of standards.

    Standards should **not** be followed blindly. They should always help the critical thinking process, but never replace it. Aim for continual improvement.

There are pros and cons to having standards:

<endIntro />

**✅ The pros:**

* They help speed up the decision making process – getting you to the best decision faster
* They help maintain [consistency](/do-you-understand-the-value-of-consistency)

**❌ The cons:**

* They take time to write in a generic fashion
* Technological rules rust easily. Technologies and techniques change often, so you must be on the lookout for the new and better approaches and continually update these
* They have errors as they are written by imperfect people
* People will sometimes follow an inappropriate rule. A set of rules can never predict every path, so cases can and will appear that the standards fail to cater for

## Enhancing standards through continuous and collaborative improvement

**Never** ignore a potential improvement or expect someone else to work on it.

If you believe something can be improved or a standard is outdated, it's important to take action. The best approach is through a team effort, where everyone contributes small improvements regularly.

Whenever you come across a standard which needs updating or improving you have 3 options:

1. [Fix it yourself straight away](/fix-small-web-errors) and [edit the rule](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Rules.Content/wiki/How-to-Edit-Rules) (preferred)
2. Fix it yourself later if it's too big. In this case, [send yourself an email](/dones-do-you-send-yourself-emails)
3. Ask someone else to fix it following the [change "x" to "y"](/do-you-ask-for-content-changes-using-from-x-to-y)
