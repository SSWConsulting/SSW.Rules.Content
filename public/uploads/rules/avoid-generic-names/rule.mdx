<introEmbed
  body={<>
Generic names like “manager”, "helper", “processor”, “data”, and “info” are easy to reach for, but they tell us very little about a class or method’s true purpose. These words are catch-alls — they don’t communicate what the code actually does or what entity it represents. Avoiding these vague terms forces us to choose names that reflect a specific role or responsibility.

/>
## Why generic names are problematic

Words like "manager" and "processor" imply something that handles various tasks, which can make it tempting to pile unrelated responsibilities into one class. "Helper" makes this worse as it becomes a catch-all for a collection of disorganized functionality. Names like "data" or "info" are similarly ambiguous, as they could apply to nearly anything, from a database connection to a simple string.

Specific names are always preferable, as they make the code easier to understand and prevent code bloat from accumulating unrelated functionality.
