<introEmbed
  body={<>
When there are too many choices always Default to the most common ones. Then add a checkbox to allow the advanced users to turn off the common choices.
  </>}
/>
<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    [x] Only include common choices
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

Likewise in a contacts database where you have entries from all around the world it is good to add a check box on the search screen similar to the following:

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    [x] Only include customers that have been updated by employees (not directly entered from the web)
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

A good example on that the checkbox on the search screen of TimePRO.NET:

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: 'Default search tick box in TimePRO.NET',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-avoid-data-junk-data-not-manually-entered-by-yourself/../../assets/DefaultSearch.gif"
/>
