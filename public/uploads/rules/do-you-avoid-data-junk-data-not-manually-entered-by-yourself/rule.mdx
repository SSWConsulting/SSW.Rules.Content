When there are too many choices always Default to the most common ones. Then add a checkbox to allow the advanced users to turn off the common choices.

<endOfIntro />


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    [x] Only include common choices
  </>}
  captionStyle="default"
  caption={""}
/>


Likewise in a contacts database where you have entries from all around the world it is good to add a check box on the search screen similar to the following:


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    [x] Only include customers that have been updated by employees (not directly entered from the web)
  </>}
  captionStyle="default"
  caption={""}
/>


A good example on that the checkbox on the search screen of TimePRO.NET:

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  captionStyle="goodExample"
  caption={"Default search tick box in TimePRO.NET"}
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-avoid-data-junk-data-not-manually-entered-by-yourself/DefaultSearch.gif"
/>
