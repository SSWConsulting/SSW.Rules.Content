Here are examples of the prompting techniques on the cheat sheet:

## Give a role


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    *You are a... 🤖*
  </>}
  captionStyle="default"
  captionText={""}
/>


ChatGPT can be given a role to understand the context of what it will need to do/know.

See some examples below:


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    
*...writing coach: How can I improve the clarity and impact of this project proposal?"*

*...GitHub Actions expert: "What's the best way to set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions?"*

*...C# code reviewer: "Please review this C# code snippet for a new feature implementation."*

*...Copywriter: "Help me write a catchy headline for our new marketing campaign."*

*...&#123;&#123; POSITION &#125;&#125; interviewer: "Act as a UX Designer interviewer and ask me 5 relevant questions."*
  </>}
  captionStyle="default"
  captionText={""}
/>


## Some dos ✅

* For complex tasks, use: *"ask any questions needed for context"*


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    *"Design a new feature for our mobile app and ask me any questions for context."*
  </>}
  captionStyle="default"
  captionText={""}
/>


* Tell it to *"be concise"* or *"use bullet points"*


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    *"Summarize the benefits of using React in our project, and please be concise. Use bullet points with pros and cons."*
  </>}
  captionStyle="default"
  captionText={""}
/>


* Set the tone for responses (e.g. professional, informal, funny)


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    Professional: *"Explain the importance of code reviews in a professional tone."*

Informal: *"In an informal tone, tell me why UX design matters for our app."*

Funny: *"Share a funny anecdote about a marketing campaign that went wrong."*
  </>}
  captionStyle="default"
  captionText={""}
/>


* Specify the response format (e.g. "describe point by point", "paragraph description")


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    Point-by-point description: *"Please describe the advantages of using React in points."*

Paragraph description: *"Please describe the development process of C# in four paragraphs."*
  </>}
  captionStyle="default"
  captionText={""}
/>


## Some don’ts ❌

* Don't ask leading questions. Don’t anchor ChatGPT.


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    *“Isn't Python the best language for this project?"*
  </>}
  captionStyle="badExample"
  captionText={"Bad example"}
/>



<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    *"What language would be best for this project and why?"*
  </>}
  captionStyle="goodExample"
  captionText={"Good example"}
/>


* Don’t share confidential information with ChatGPT

According to Forbes, any data shared with ChatGPT could end up being leaked since the data becomes part of a collective database.

## The anatomy of a prompt - 5 prompts in 1 🫀

It’s important to consider what a prompt is made up of. Here’s an example that breaks down the different components of a good prompt:

* **Role** - *You are a Software Developer.*
* **Result** - *Create 5 email subjects.*
* **Context** - *The email is to inform all the developers about a UX problem with search.*
* **Intent** - *The goal is to get them to critique my YouTube video.*
* **Constraint** - *Subject < 50 characters.*

## Prompt Chaining

Prompt chaining is the technique of guiding GTP's responses by asking a series of related questions or prompts, building upon the previous answers to obtain more coherent and relevant information.
