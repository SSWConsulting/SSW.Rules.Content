During a [Brainstorming Day](/use-the-brains-of-your-company), many great ideas are generated, discussed, and refined. But what happens to these ideas once the day is over? Without a dedicated individual to drive an idea forward, it risks being forgotten or losing momentum. This is where the "Idea Champion" comes in.

## The Idea Champion's responsibilities

* **Take accountability** for the idea until a Scrum Team has been assigned and development has started or the idea is parked
* **Discuss** the idea and answer people's questions
* **Communicate** the status of the idea in the relevant [GitHub Discussion](/brainstorming-idea-farming)
* **Push the idea forwards** and get closure (approval/rejection)

### Where it begins

* An Idea Champion should be assigned to each idea for a specific Brainstorming Day. This is done when [allocating teams](/brainstorming-team-allocation)
* The Idea Champion can change on the day of the Brainstorming, or after, if the team decides there is a better person

### Where it ends

The Idea Champion's role is over when either:

✅ There is a Scrum Team working on the project
or
❌ Approval isn't reached and the idea is parked (this is a perfectly acceptable outcome - it can always be revisited in a future Brainstorming Day)

### Using labels

[Using GitHub labels](/do-you-know-how-to-use-tags-for-github-issues) is a great way to keep the status of an idea up to date!
