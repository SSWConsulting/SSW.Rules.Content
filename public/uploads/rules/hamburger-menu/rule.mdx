Hamburger menus are everywhere. They are popular and they declutter mobile UIs but the downside is that the menu items are less discoverable and require an extra click.

## When should you use a hamburger menu?

Use it **only when screen space is tight** (typically on mobile). Otherwise, always prefer showing navigation visibly.

### ✅ Best practices

Users expect consistency in navigation — so make sure your hamburger menu behaves the way they expect.

* **Placement:** The best location depends on your site’s purpose:
  * For **utility** or **web app pages**, keep the hamburger menu in the **top-left corner** - this follows common patterns (see Microsoft example below)
  * For **marketing** or **brand-focused pages**, prioritize logo visibility - in this case, place the hamburger menu on the **top-right** to give prominence to your logo
* **Icon design:** Use the **standard three-line icon** - don't reinvent it
* **Toggle behavior:** When opened, the hamburger icon should **transform into a cross (X)** to indicate it can be closed
* **Branding:** If your layout includes only a logo and menu, **favor left alignment** for improved visibility and brand recognition
