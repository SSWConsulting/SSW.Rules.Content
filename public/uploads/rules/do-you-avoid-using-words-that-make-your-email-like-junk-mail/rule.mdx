Words matter—especially in email. Spam filters are increasingly sensitive, and even internal corporate emails can get caught if you're not careful. Worse still, your email may look unprofessional or overly “salesy,” which reduces trust and engagement.

Outlook by default reads your emails and can flag your email as potential junk email, or adult content email by examining a list of sensitive words. This list is not available to the public.

If you use terms like “free,” “urgent,” “guaranteed,” “buy now,” or all caps with too many exclamation marks, your message might be flagged as junk, even if it's important and well-written.

## ✅ Tips

* Write with clarity and purpose, not hype
* Avoid overly promotional phrases
* Limit exclamation marks and all-caps
* Check tone with a colleague or a spam filter tool
