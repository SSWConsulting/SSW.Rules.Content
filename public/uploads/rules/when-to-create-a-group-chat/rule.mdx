If you intend to talk about someone in your chat, it's best to add that person to a group chat.

This approach is useful before starting a Teams call and you can simply say _"I'll call you in 5 mins"_ in your group chat to let everyone in the group know that you need to chat with them.

Group chats should also be used to [replace meeting chats if they need non-attendees to join](/teams-meetings-vs-group-chats).

  body={<>
    **Note:** When deciding whether to use a group chat, think of how you'd approach the same conversation in an email - if you'd [cc someone in the email](/cc-and-reply-to-all), then you should include them in the group chat.

## What if people are sitting next to each other

Always add everybody into the chat, even if they’re sitting next to each other. If during the call messages are sent, everybody gets them.

## Make sure people are available

You shouldn't make the call if the participants have [Teams status](/use-the-status-message-in-teams) "In a call" or their status message suggests they shouldn't be disturbed.
