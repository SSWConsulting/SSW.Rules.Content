seoDescription: Customize your CRM entities by exporting each individual customization
  or select what to import, ensuring seamless updates and minimizing impact on live
  environments.
title: Customization - Do you export only the customizations of entities that you
  did customize? (CRM 4 only)

Export each single entity customization and keep each entity customization in a separate file, like:

* Account_11022009.xml
* Contact_11022009.xml

<endIntro />

This way, if an entity is changed or broken on the Live environment, you can re-import the customization for this entity again, without breaking other entities on live environment.

Instead of exporting each single entity, you can also export only your customized entities in 1 step, and afterwards select what entities to import
