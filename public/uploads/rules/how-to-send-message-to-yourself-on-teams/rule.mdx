Here are the steps to send a message to yourself on Teams:

1. Schedule a meeting with just yourself and give it a title like “Just me” or anything similar that is obvious to you
2. Open the meeting request like any other meeting on Teams
3. Open the chat feature and write yourself a “test” message
4. You should see a new conversation next to all your other groups and private chats
5. Pin it, and now you have a wall for your thoughts 💭 🧱
