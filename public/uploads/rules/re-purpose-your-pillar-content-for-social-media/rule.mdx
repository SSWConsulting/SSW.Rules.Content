You spend a lot of time and money creating great video content, so you need to make sure that you get the most out of your time and money.

Content creation wizard Gary V (Vaynerchuk) has shared a great model for this on his blog called the 'reverse pyramid' where you start with a video, that you are able to repurpose into dozens of smaller pieces of content, contextual to the platforms that you distribute them to.

This could take many different forms — for example, if you’re not comfortable on video, you could record a podcast. You might even film yourself recording the podcast so you could have a video out of it as well. And from that video or audio clip, you can create content for Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and more.

You can find an explanation of the [Gary V Content Model here.](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/how-to-create-64-pieces-of-content-in-a-day)
  </>}

### Step 1: Create pillar content

This is the content that will be used to create all other types of content. They include:

* Interview
* Q&A
* Presentation
* Educational Video
* Daily vlog
* Demo

<youtubeEmbed url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1fpIynISxnM" description={"Video: An example of a smaller video you can be used to drive traffic to your YouTube Channel"} />

2. Create a quotable image with a nice background:

* Create a version of the video for Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and/or Instagram. Write the copy for the post.

  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good example - Create a version of the video to distribute on the platforms you use",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/re-purpose-your-pillar-content-for-social-media/ASPNETCORE30_ENDPOINT_AUTHORIZATION_WITCHCRAFT.png"
/>

3. Create a [Giphy](https://giphy.com/) with one of the main points and a moving background video from the pillar content. Write the copy for the post.
4. Create a blog post from the audio

* Use tools like [Rev](https://www.rev.com) or [Descript](https://www.descript.com/) to transcribe the video file and re-write the transcript as a blog post
* Post the blog post to other platforms like Medium.com, LinkedIn Articles, [Substack](https://substack.com/)and your blog

### Step 2: Distribute content

At 12 pm, you should post your pillar content on all platforms. At 12:01 pm, you should post all your micro-content.

Remember the micro-content should promote your pillar content.

You should also publish the blog post. You will republish the blog post on other websites in 2 weeks in Step 6.

### Step 3: Monitor comments and reply to all

You must reply to all comments and use these comments to find out what content should be created next.

### Step 4: Email the best video to the list

At the end of the week, you will email the best video out to your list with a listing of the other videos.

### Step 5: Publish the blog post

You need to wait 2 weeks before republishing the blog post to other platforms, so Google knows that your website is the source of the blog post.

The sites you can/will republish to are:

* Medium - Using the WordPress publishing tool
* LinkedIn Articles
* [Substack](https://substack.com/)
* [Quora](https://www.quora.com/)
