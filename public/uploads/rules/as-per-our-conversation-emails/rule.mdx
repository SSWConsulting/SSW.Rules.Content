Always follow up **important** conversations (usually via phone or IM) with an email that begins with the words "As per our conversation". The intent is to document what was said and agreed upon.

When possible, go the extra mile and confirm the requirements by [sharing your screen](/do-you-share-screens-when-working-remotely) with the drafted email, and then add the words [“==checked by XXX==”](/checked-by-xxx) at the top before sending.

Watch the video below and see how a single email can make your job easier.

This is not just a 'cover my ass' email. This is for several reasons:

* To make sure that you did not get the message wrong
* To keep an audit trail of agreed decisions
* To keep people, who were not a party to the conversation, informed about the progress

Use this approach internally and with clients. As a result, expect to see "as per our conversation" emails that:

* **Require a task to be completed**
* Explain the logic of the decision
* Include URLs that were referred to
* Can be referred back to in the future

    **Notes:**

* This is most likely to happen after a conversation started **by the client**. If **you** are the one making the first contact, also [prepare, then confirm conversations/decisions](/do-you-prepare-then-confirm-conversations-decisions)
* Add other interested parties into the 'as per our conversation' as required. _'As per our conversation with Bob, I am going to do xxx'_.
* For a major architectural decision, etc. that could be difficult or expensive to change later, which was made against your recommendation, consider sending a ["For the record" email](/do-you-send-a-for-the-record-email-when-you-disagree).

It's easy to fall into the trap of sounding rather robotic if you start every email with "As per our conversation", or "As per the message I just left on your mobile", etc. Here's a list of nice email openers that have the same effect:

"As per our conversation" alternatives:

* Thanks for the chat
* Good talking to you
* As discussed...

"As per the message I left on your mobile" alternatives:

* I couldn't catch you on the phone today.
* I just left you a quick voicemail.
* I called earlier but couldn't get through.
* Hey I just called earlier to say...

### What if they don't answer?

In most cases, you don't want to be blocked by not being able to have a conversation with the client or Product Owner. In the case where you can't reach them by calling them on the phone or Microsoft Teams, you will have to make a decision by yourself.

In this case, it's still important to record everything in an email, starting with "I tried calling you but didn't get through".

<emailEmbed
  from=""
  to="John"
  cc=""
  bcc=""
  subject="Spec Review for Northwind"
  shouldDisplayBody={true}
  body={<>
    ## Hi John

==I tried calling you but didn't get through.== I am going to offer the client a Spec Review for &#123;&#123; $ &#125;&#125;
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Email when you can't reach the person by calling"
/>

You should also send a quick message on Microsoft Teams with a brief summary of the decision you made, referencing the email you sent about the decision.

### Location - include the reason at the top

When you have an image or other information, remember to keep the main reason text as the first thing in the email body to give it better visibility.
