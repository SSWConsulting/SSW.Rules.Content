Backing up your WordPress site is important and while most hosting providers will perform backups on your behalf, it doesnâ€™t hurt to have another copy tucked away safely. For this purpose we use and recommend the [BackWPup WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/backwpup).
  </>}
/>
It simplifies WordPress backups and can be configured to back up your site to:

- FTP server
- **Dropbox**
- Amazon S3 services
- **Microsoft Azure**
- RackSpaceCloud
- SugarSync

We setup our WordPress sites to backup daily to Dropbox:

    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "AdamCogan.com blog backs up daily to Dropbox",

  } }
