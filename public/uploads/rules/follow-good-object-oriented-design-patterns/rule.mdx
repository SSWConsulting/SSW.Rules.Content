  body={<>
TypeScript gives us a reasonably full-featured object-oriented system, and we should use it as such. Following the [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_%28object-oriented_design%29) and [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) principles are encouraged.

Write code that you’d be proud to see in C#, because there are no longer any excuses.
