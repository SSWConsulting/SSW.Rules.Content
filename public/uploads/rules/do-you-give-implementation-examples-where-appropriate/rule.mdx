seoDescription: By providing clear implementation examples, you help readers successfully
  apply rules and improve comprehension.
title: Do you give implementation examples where appropriate?
type: rule
uri: do-you-give-implementation-examples-where-appropriate
---
By giving examples you are demonstrating clearly to the reader how he/she can implement the rule correctly. It is better to position an example of the best possible scenario last so that the reader is left with a clear example in his/her mind as to what is required.
