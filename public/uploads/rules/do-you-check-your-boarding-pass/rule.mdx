Most people don’t pay much attention to their boarding pass beyond their gate and seat number, but if you know what to look for, there’s a lot of information stored on a boarding pass!
  </>}
/>
- **PRN reference:** Passenger Name Record. It’s a six-digit alphanumeric code.
- **Sequence:**  This is the order in which you checked in to your flight, e.g. if your sequence number is 066 you’re the 66th person to check in.
- **Boarding door:** Have you noticed this, which tells you whether to board the plane from the front or rear?
- **SSSS:** Secondary Security Screening Selection picks passengers either at random or due to red flags (such as buying a one-way ticket with cash).
