In SharePoint 2010, you can use SharePoint service  **/\_vti\_bin/listdata.svc** to access data in SharePoint list, but in SharePoint 2013,  **/\_vti\_bin/listdata.svc** has been officially deprecated.

<endIntro />
The new service in SharePoint 2013 is  **/server/site/\_api/web/lists/getbytitle('listname')**
