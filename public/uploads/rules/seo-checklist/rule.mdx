Do you find yourself reworking pages on your website that weren’t created with SEO in mind?
Businesses face this common challenge: balancing value for real users **and** ticking the right boxes for search-engine algorithms.

The best way to avoid this is to **start each webpage with solid SEO built in**. To support this, use a consistent **SEO components checklist** when creating any new page.

<endIntro />

Because not everyone creating pages is a developer, the process should be streamlined:

* Have the requester (content author, marketer) fill a template (for example a GitHub issue) containing the checklist
* The developer uses that to build the page and ensure all SEO elements are included

## 🌐 SEO checklist for websites

Use this list to maintain a technically healthy and high-performing website:

### ⚡ Performance

1. **[Page Load Speed](/website-page-speed)** – Minimize heavy scripts, compress images, enable caching, and use lazy loading
2. **Performance Metrics** – Monitor Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, INP) using PageSpeed Insights or Lighthouse
3. **Server & Hosting Performance** – Verify server response time, CDN configuration, and reliable uptime from your hosting provider

### 🔒 Security & Reliability

4. **HTTPS / Secure** – Ensure the site loads via HTTPS with a valid SSL certificate
5. **Security & Uptime Monitoring** – Use automated tools or services to monitor downtime, SSL renewals, and vulnerabilities

### 🧭 Crawlability & Indexing

6. **[Sitemap](/sitemap-xml-best-practices) / Robots.txt / Crawlability** – Confirm all important pages are crawlable and **included in the sitemap**
7. **Canonical Tags / Duplicate Content Handling** – Use canonical tags or `noindex` where needed to avoid duplicate content
8. **Broken Links & Redirects** – Regularly [scan for 404s (e.g. CodeAuditor)](https://codeauditor.com/) and ensure redirects are correctly implemented

### 🧩 Structure & Tracking

9. **[Schema / Structured Data](/structured-website)** – Use structured markup (e.g., Articles, Products, FAQs) to help search engines understand your content
10. **Analytics & Search Console** – Ensure tracking tools (e.g., [Google Analytics](/use-google-analytics), Google Search Console) are properly configured

### 📱 User Experience

11. **[Responsive / Mobile-First Design](/responsive-design)** – Renders correctly on all devices and screen sizes

## SEO checklist for new webpages

Use this list to validate each new page **before publishing**:

### 🏷️ Core On-Page SEO

1. **Descriptive Page Title** – Includes the target keyword, is compelling, and under ~60 characters
2. **[Meta Description](/html-meta-tags)** – Unique for the page, includes a keyword, and gives a strong value proposition
3. **Single H1 Tag** – Clearly describes the page, aligns with the page title, includes the keyword
4. **[Friendly URLs / Slugs](/create-friendly-short-urls)** – Short, descriptive, and uses hyphens; contains the keyword and avoids unnecessary parameters

### ✍️ Content & Structure

5. **Heading Structure (H2, H3, ...)** – Content broken up with subheadings; readable, logical hierarchy
6. **Content Quality & Relevance** – Matches user intent, uses primary and secondary keywords naturally (no stuffing), provides real value

### 🧩 Technical & Media Optimization

7. **[Image Optimization](/optimize-your-images)** – Descriptive filenames, alt text for accessibility, and optimized file size
8. **Semantic Markup & Accessibility** – Use proper HTML tags, ARIA roles, and descriptive alt text
9. **Social Sharing Tags ([Open Graph](/use-open-graph))** – Add metadata for sharing (title, description, image)

### 🧪 Review & Validation

10. **Quality Review / QA** – Preview on devices and browsers, check links, validate HTML, and test page speed

Following these checklists ensures your pages and your overall website are **search-engine friendly from day one**, avoiding costly rework later.

### Using GitHub Issues for a new webpage

Not everybody who wants to create a webpage is actually doing the creation (sometimes they will give the task to a developer). Therefore, to make sure that content does not get lost in the creation process, it is important to have a streamlined procedure.

Creating a GitHub Issue is the best way for non-developers to send the request for a new webpage to their developers. So, the best place to keep your checklist is in a GitHub Issue template that exists specifically for requesting a new page on your website. See this rule about [GitHub issue templates](/github-issue-templates/).

To see an example in action, see [the template for adding a new page to SSW.Website](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=new_webpage.yml&title=%F0%9F%93%84+%7B%7B+TITLE+%7D%7D+). The user replaces all the placeholders with their information, and when a developer creates the page they will know to include the important SEO components.
