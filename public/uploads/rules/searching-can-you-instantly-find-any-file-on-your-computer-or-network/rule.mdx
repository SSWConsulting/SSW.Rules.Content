Often you will want to quickly find a file on your computer or local network. With the advancement in built-in search functionality on the latest operating systems this is easy to do and can help you quickly and easily find your local files or network file locations.

If you are using Windows, desktop search is integrated within the operating system. This can either be done from the **Start Menu**, **Cortana** or **File Explorer**. Additionally, third-party tools such as [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/) can be installed and used for fast searching of files on your drives.

If you are using a Mac, **Spotlight Search** 🔎 is located on the top-right corner or **Finder**.

If you are using Office 365 (Teams, Delve, OneDrive, Dynamics) you can use [SharePoint Search](/do-you-know-what-are-the-sharepoint-features-our-customers-love) to easily find your documents, profiles, and web pages.
