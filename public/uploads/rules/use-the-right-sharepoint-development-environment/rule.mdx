Development for SharePoint is very different depending upon whether you are online or using On-Premises SharePoint.
  </>}

## For SharePoint Online

All you need is VSCode – all modern customizations are doing using the [SharePoint Framework (SPFx)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/sharepoint-framework-overview?WT.mc_id=M365-MVP-33518).

💡 Best practice is to isolate your code as much as possible during development/staging. Unfortunately it's not easy to come up with a full-blown dedicated Test Tenant.\
As a minimum, make sure you test all your custom code in a dedicated Site Collection to avoid as much side effects as possible.

See our rule to modern [SharePoint Development](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/sharepoint-development).

## For SharePoint 2016, 2019 or SE

1. It's very important to correctly setup a SharePoint environment for development. Correctly configured, this will save you a lot of trouble later on
2. From time to time, you can seriously damage a SharePoint installation during development and it is best not to install SharePoint on your everyday working machine. Additionally, when you start a new SharePoint project you don't want to carry all the luggage from a previous customization that could potentially affect your new project
3. Virtual machines can be fired up and shut down easily
4. Virtual machines can be relocated on a different server and thus it doesn't waste developers' own computer resources
5. Virtual machines can be copied and brought to a client for demonstration
6. Very easy for someone to quickly create a new SharePoint server to quickly test or experiment with SharePoint
7. Bad - There might be more work required to activate additional servers. SharePoint Farms are a lot of work. E.g. Search Server VMs
