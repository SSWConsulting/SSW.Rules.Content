Irrelevant of the type of application, "Close" should never be used in any wizard or form. 'Cancel' has a much clearer definition and should always be used to exit a process without starting it, saving it or changing it.

See our rule [Do you label your form buttons consistently?](/do-you-label-your-form-buttons-consistently) on this.
