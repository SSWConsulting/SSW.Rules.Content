AI is a productivity force multiplier, and in some situations, it is good to be transparent that it helped you. Other times, it is more important that the message feels like it came personally from you.

So, in what situations should you attribute AI? Let's find out.

<endIntro />

## Benefits of attributing AI

* **Adoption** - Spread and encourage usage of AI by showing how and when you use it, enabling others to think about when they can use it too
* **Transparency** - Others can identify AI-generated content, promoting openness and trust
* **Responsibility** - Encourages responsible use of AI-generated content
* **Accountability** - If there's something wrong with the content, you can tell that someone has used AI lazily (see rules on [avoiding Automation Bias](/avoid-automation-bias) and [using AI responsibly](/use-ai-responsibly))

## When shouldn't you attribute AI?

Not attributing AI doesn't mean simply omitting the attribution. It means thoroughly checking the output, and rewording it yourself if necessary, such that you own the work.

* **External communication** - It's important for clients and other external stakeholders to know that your work has been given a “human touch” and genuine effort has been put in. Otherwise, it could make you look lazy
* **When AI use is assumed** - These days, most code is shipped with the help of AI. It's expected that the quality of this code is of a high standard, and attributing code you commit to AI may appear that you are “hiding” behind the disclaimer

## The 🤖 emoji

To save space and time, you can use the 🤖 emoji to indicate that AI helped.

You should draw a distinction between “AI helped” and “AI wholly wrote this”.

    **— AI was used to refine and edit this content —**

  figure="Draws too much attention to the attribution"

  body={<>
    &#123;&#123; AI ASSISTED CONTENT &#125;&#125; 🤖
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Much cleaner, using the emoji"
/>

When AI wrote something entirely, use two robot emojis.

    *As we watched the sunset from our office balcony, the conversation turned to the latest tech trends. The sky was painted in hues of pink and orange, but our minds were on the latest software updates and hardware releases. The birds chirped their goodnight songs as we debated the merits of different programming languages and platforms. It was a peaceful moment, a brief pause in the chaos of the tech world, and we couldn't help but feel grateful for the opportunity to work in such an exciting and constantly evolving industry.*
    
    ***— *This was entirely generated by AI —**

    **Notes:**
    
    * Consider using this mostly internally, as clients and suppliers may not understand the meaning
    * In the second case, if you want to go the extra mile and demonstrate how you used it, you can even paste the prompt you used to generate your message

This is also important for generated images, [Meta has developed invisible watermarks that can be used to indicate that an image was generated by AI](https://aibusiness.com/responsible-ai/meta-develops-invisible-watermarks-to-track-ai-image-origins).

Google has also done something similar. Check out [Identifying AI-generated images with SynthID](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/identifying-ai-generated-images-with-synthid/).
