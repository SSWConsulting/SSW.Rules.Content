If you see something in a blog that interests you or that you disagree with, reply to it. You should not be afraid to voice your opinion and it's a great way to make a name for yourself and your company on the internet.

<endIntro />

Whenever anyone in your organization responds to a blog entry or forum, they should always use a standard company signature.
