Teams often unknowingly create security risks by storing secrets in configuration files, DevOps variables, or - even worse - accidentally committing them to Git 😱. This leads to production outages, broken deployments, and painful key rotations that waste time and cost money. Even when Key Vault is used, many rely on static secrets, which still require manual rotation and management. Thankfully Azure has a much safer way of solving this problem.

## What is a Managed Identity?

A **Managed Identity** is an identity that Azure creates and manages for your resource so it can authenticate securely **without storing any credentials**.

Azure automatically handles:

* password and secret rotation
* identity lifecycle
* secure authentication to Azure services

This means **no more stored secrets**, ever.

## Why Managed Identity is always better

Using secrets (even when placed in Key Vault as static keys) creates manual work and security gaps. Managed Identity removes that entire problem space.

Benefits include:

* ✅ Eliminates all secrets and keys
* ✅ More secure – nothing to leak
* ✅ Supported by all Azure SDKs
* ✅ Automatically rotates
* ✅ Free
