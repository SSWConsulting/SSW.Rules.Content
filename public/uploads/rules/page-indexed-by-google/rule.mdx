Regular Google searches can often be the best way for your website to get public exposure. If a page on your website is not indexed, it cannot be searched.

Don't be surprised if Google is already one step ahead of you - its Google bots could have already crawled your site without you knowing. So what's the best way to find out if Google has indexed your web page? 

<endIntro />

### 1. Search for it on Google

The quickest way to figure out if Google has indexed your page is to just search for it on Google.

Try site\:yourdomain.com/blog/my-new-post to confirm this. Even better just using site\:yourdomain.com will show all indexed pages on your domain

### 2. Use the Google Search Console

If you can't find it, go to [Google's Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/welcome) and submit your URL.

<imageEmbed alt="Image" size="large" showBorder={false} figurePrefix="none" figure="Sending a website to Google" src="/uploads/rules/page-indexed-by-google/sending-url-to-google.jpg" />

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    Internal pages should be crawled automatically, so you only need to inform the root of the site.
  </>}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure=""
  style="info"
/>

.

### WordPress

If your website is built on WordPress, make sure you have unselected the "Discourage search engines from indexing this site" option. This can be found under      **Reading Settings** :

<imageEmbed alt="Image" size="large" showBorder={false} figurePrefix="none" figure="WordPress has an out-of-the-box functionality to discourage search engines to show the site" src="/uploads/rules/page-indexed-by-google/wordpress-search-engines.jpg" />
