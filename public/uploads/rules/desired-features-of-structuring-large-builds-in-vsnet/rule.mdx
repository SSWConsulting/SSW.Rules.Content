The desired features of structuring large Builds in VS.NET:

<endOfIntro />

1. **Scalable** - The project should allow continuous additions to the structure

   - Developers should be able to keep adding to the structure

2. **Multiple Versions** - The project should support multiple product releases

   - The structure should be able to allow developers to work on the next release while there is still work in progress for a previous release of another section of the project
   - Developers can work side by side with different versions in parallel (i.e. at the same time)

3. **Efficient** - The build should be as quick as possible
4. **Reliability** - Builds should be reproducible on any machine and reliable
5. **Switchable** - The project should be able to switch between debug release and other versions

   - The project should be able to activate without debug
   - A config should be made for a demo build
   - It should support a full release

### Method 1 - Using Project Reference Assemblies within VS.NET

The first attempt was the following method of adding project references to a large solution.


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  captionStyle="default"
  caption={"Adding a project reference"}
  src="/uploads/rules/desired-features-of-structuring-large-builds-in-vsnet/betterlargedotnet_projref.gif"
/>


Each project within a solution references other product's assemblies by the project's GUID.

**✅ Advantages**

The advantages of adding the project to the solution is that you can easily switch between debug and release versions, and the build time is quicker.

**❌ Disadvantages**

The main disadvantage is that the project can only reference other projects within the same solution.

### Method 2 - Using File Reference Assemblies within VS.NET

The following method of adding file references to a large solution was also attempted.


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  captionStyle="default"
  caption={"Adding a file reference"}
  src="/uploads/rules/desired-features-of-structuring-large-builds-in-vsnet/betterlargedotnet_fileref.gif"
/>


This method involves projects referencing assemblies by looking into their reference path.

**✅ Advantages**

The main advantage of referencing .dll's is that it is more flexible. Projects can reference assemblies from other solutions outside the current solution.

- The solution's environment is "cleaner", allowing projects to be more expansive
- All you need to do is change the assembly to "shared"

**❌ Disadvantages**

There are, however, many disadvantages including the fact that only one version of the proj file can be added to the solution.

- The .csproj file cannot be used
- You cannot reference or one set of assemblies for debug and another for release. Only point to one
- VS.NET only use the paths specified in the .proj file as a hint. VS.NET records the location of the assemblies as options for the project for each user
- You cannot switch between versions
- You also cannot use this method if there are 200 projects in one solution
