All websites should be following [the favicon rule](/favicon).

A Favicon is a small image file included on nearly all professional developed sites. When a browser hits your website and a user bookmarks that site then the `favicon.ico` graphic will be displayed in the browser’s URL/address line upon subsequent visits to that site.

Let's see how it's done for SharePoint:

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    
&lt;head runat="server"&gt;
    &lt;meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft SharePoint"&gt;
    &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"&gt;
    &lt;!--Placeholder for additional overrides--&gt;
    &lt;asp:ContentPlaceHolder ID="PlaceHolderAdditionalPageHead" runat="server" /&gt;
    <mark>&lt;link rel=&quot;shortcut icon&quot; href=&quot;~/Style Library/Images/SSW/Rules/ssw.ico&quot; type=&quot;image/x-icon&quot; /&gt;</mark>
&lt;/head&gt;

  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'One line of HTML lets you add your company\'s icon to your SharePoint site',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
/>
