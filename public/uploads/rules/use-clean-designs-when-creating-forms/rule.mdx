As we know, [an image is worth a thousand words](/use-screenshots-in-your-proposals). So here are some examples of how to make cleaner forms:
  </>}
/>
### Bad Example

A fairly standard Access 97 application that needs some love (Before a makeover)

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: 'Avoid using background colors for your form controls - they can be confusing',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-clean-designs-when-creating-forms/accessui_candidateedit1_before.gif"
/>

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: 'Avoid using non-standard fonts on your forms - keep them as close to Windows XP forms as possible',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-clean-designs-when-creating-forms/accessui_candidateedit2_before.gif"
/>

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: 'All these forms will be grouped into a tabbed form',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-clean-designs-when-creating-forms/accessui_candidateedit3_before.gif"
/>

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: 'The form is backward, with the employee\'s details at the top. It\'s not clear what needs to be changed, and the form is missing the current key information',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-clean-designs-when-creating-forms/accessui_candidateedit4_before.gif"
/>

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: 'The colors on this form are very distracting and add no value to the user - keep it clean',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-clean-designs-when-creating-forms/accessui_candidatesearch_before.gif"
/>

### Good Example

Screenshots of the existing Application in Access 97 after an SSW makeover (Good)


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'This is the same application above - can you believe it? We grouped the forms into tabs',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-clean-designs-when-creating-forms/accessui_candidateedit1_after.gif"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'The icons give the form visual appeal and help to break up the plain colors',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-clean-designs-when-creating-forms/accessui_candidateedit2_after.gif"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'It\'s easy to present your form more cleanly and with a Windows XP feel',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-clean-designs-when-creating-forms/accessui_candidateedit3_after.gif"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'Even tricky forms with lots of logic can be tidied up. We used XP-styled controls and careful alignment to make this form more usable',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}

### Better Example

Access 2007 is an Easy Way to Give Your Old Access Application a new look (Best)

These samples are from a Property Purchase and Negotiation Tracking application created for Queensland Water Infrastructure.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: 'The main menu of one of our first Access 2007 UIs. It looks even better than the revamped Access 97 application',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-clean-designs-when-creating-forms/Aqua_MainMenu.jpg"
/>

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: 'Note the Action buttons in the top right hand corner - they are based on the Access 2007 templates',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-clean-designs-when-creating-forms/Aqua_Valuation.jpg"
/>

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: 'This picker form is based on a web-style picker UI such as Hotmail so users have a familiar UI',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-clean-designs-when-creating-forms/Aqua_PickerForm.jpg"
/>

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: 'With the use of frames with background colours, we have visually grouped controls',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-clean-designs-when-creating-forms/Aqua_Agreement.jpg"
/>
