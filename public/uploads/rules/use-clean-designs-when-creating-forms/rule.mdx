As we know, [an image is worth a thousand words](/use-screenshots-in-your-proposals). So here are some examples of how to make cleaner forms:

<endIntro />

### Bad Example

A fairly standard Access 97 application that needs some love (Before a makeover)

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure={"Avoid using background colors for your form controls - they can be confusing"}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-clean-designs-when-creating-forms/accessui_candidateedit1_before.gif"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure={"Avoid using non-standard fonts on your forms - keep them as close to Windows XP forms as possible"}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-clean-designs-when-creating-forms/accessui_candidateedit2_before.gif"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure={"All these forms will be grouped into a tabbed form"}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-clean-designs-when-creating-forms/accessui_candidateedit3_before.gif"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure={"The form is backward, with the employee's details at the top. It's not clear what needs to be changed, and the form is missing the current key information"}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-clean-designs-when-creating-forms/accessui_candidateedit4_before.gif"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure={"The colors on this form are very distracting and add no value to the user - keep it clean"}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-clean-designs-when-creating-forms/accessui_candidatesearch_before.gif"
/>


### Good Example

Screenshots of the existing Application in Access 97 after an SSW makeover (Good)


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure={"This is the same application above - can you believe it? We grouped the forms into tabs"}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-clean-designs-when-creating-forms/accessui_candidateedit1_after.gif"
/>



<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure={"The icons give the form visual appeal and help to break up the plain colors"}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-clean-designs-when-creating-forms/accessui_candidateedit2_after.gif"
/>



<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure={"It's easy to present your form more cleanly and with a Windows XP feel"}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-clean-designs-when-creating-forms/accessui_candidateedit3_after.gif"
/>



<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure={"Even tricky forms with lots of logic can be tidied up. We used XP-styled controls and careful alignment to make this form more usable"}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-clean-designs-when-creating-forms/accessui_candidatesearch_after.gif"
/>


### Better Example

Access 2007 is an Easy Way to Give Your Old Access Application a new look (Best)

These samples are from a Property Purchase and Negotiation Tracking application created for Queensland Water Infrastructure.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure={"The main menu of one of our first Access 2007 UIs. It looks even better than the revamped Access 97 application"}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-clean-designs-when-creating-forms/Aqua_MainMenu.jpg"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure={"Note the Action buttons in the top right hand corner - they are based on the Access 2007 templates"}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-clean-designs-when-creating-forms/Aqua_Valuation.jpg"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure={"This picker form is based on a web-style picker UI such as Hotmail so users have a familiar UI"}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-clean-designs-when-creating-forms/Aqua_PickerForm.jpg"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure={"With the use of frames with background colours, we have visually grouped controls"}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-clean-designs-when-creating-forms/Aqua_Agreement.jpg"
/>
