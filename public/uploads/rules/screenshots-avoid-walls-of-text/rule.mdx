Communicating effectively often involves moving away from lengthy 'Walls of Text'. Instead, using screenshots can convey the message more succinctly and efficiently, reducing the reliance on excessive wording.

Consider the following points:

* **Efficiency** - Screenshots enable people cc’ed to check the task by quickly skimming, not needing to click on links
* **Capture the moment** - Tasks can take time to get to, often weeks or months! Reports and dashboards change over time and without a screenshot, a developer probably won't know what the person was looking at
* **Clear and concise** - Screenshots are like the ‘x’ in the useful format of change x to y (see related rules) Make the task as clear as possible!

Going further, there are ways to improve the readability of your screenshots:

## Tip 1: Add visual indicators to guide attention

You can take screen captures to the next level by visually guiding the user through the interface instead of relying on surrounding explanation.

Apart from plain screenshots (when no emphasis is needed), you can use:

* Balloons
* Circles / boxes
* Arrows

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    **Note:** Follow the rule on [adding branding to screenshots](/screenshots-add-branding) for visual consistency.
    
    See more details on [how to configure balloons' branding in Fullshot and Snagit](/screenshots-add-branding).
  </>}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure=""
  style="info"
/>

### Balloons (aka speech bubbles)

Adding balloons is great because you can point to a specific part of the image and provide extra text information. It is much easier than reading the old ‘Wall of Text’.

<imageEmbed alt="Image" size="medium" showBorder={true} figurePrefix="bad" figure="The email is using a screenshot so that is good, but you need to read the text and relate it to the image" src="/uploads/rules/screenshots-avoid-walls-of-text/balloon-bad-example.jpg" />

<imageEmbed alt="Image" size="medium" showBorder={true} figurePrefix="good" figure="The balloon with text on the screenshot, makes it quicker to understand" src="/uploads/rules/screenshots-avoid-walls-of-text/balloon-good-example.jpg" />

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    Warning:** **Be aware not to overuse balloons. Most screenshots already provide enough context. Extra text can clutter the image and distract from the key message.
  </>}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure=""
  style="warning"
/>

<imageEmbed alt="Image" size="medium" showBorder={true} figurePrefix="bad" figure="Balloon overload" src="/uploads/rules/screenshots-avoid-walls-of-text/balloon-overload.jpg" />

### Circles or boxes

<imageEmbed alt="Image" size="medium" showBorder={true} figurePrefix="good" figure="See 3 balloons were not needed" src="/uploads/rules/screenshots-avoid-walls-of-text/balloon-not-needed.jpg" />

### Arrows

<imageEmbed alt="Image" size="large" showBorder={true} figurePrefix="good" figure="Sometimes an arrow is all that is needed" src="/uploads/rules/screenshots-avoid-walls-of-text/arrow-example.png" />

#### Pay attention to the arrow tail

When you use an arrow in your screenshot, make sure you start the arrow from an appropriate place.

<imageEmbed alt="Image" size="large" showBorder={true} figurePrefix="bad" figure="Arrow might make people think 'chat' and the direction it points are related" src="/uploads/rules/screenshots-avoid-walls-of-text/arrow-bad-example.png" />

<imageEmbed alt="Image" size="large" showBorder={true} figurePrefix="good" figure="If you just want to emphasize what you're pointing to, start drawing the arrow from an empty space" src="/uploads/rules/screenshots-avoid-walls-of-text/arrow-good-example.png" />

## Tip 2: Avoid blank spaces

By cropping empty spaces in screenshots, you can make things easier to read and understand. Most times you can achieve this by resizing the application window before taking the screenshot.

It's like zooming in on the important bits, making them bigger and friendlier for the users.
