title: Do You Choose TFS-Git Over Team Foundation Source Control?

Only a madman would write software today without using source control.

Apart from being the easiest way to back-up your code, and having the ability to go back to a previous state, source control provides a huge number of benefits, especially when integrated with Continuous Integration servers, and Continuous Deployment solutions.

But which source control solution should I choose?

Once users become familiar with it, it also allows for far more control and flexibility. Note: My Work and Code Review are not currently compatible with TFS Git, and you will need to fall back to the Git command line for more complex source control commands"
