Microsoft uses this one:

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good Example - Microsoft error message is concise",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/messages-do-you-use-messages-that-are-concise/NotEnoughMemory.gif"
/>


Some other message types that Microsoft uses are:

| Message type          | Sample message                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Not enough disk space | There is not enough disk space to complete the operation. Delete some unneeded files on your hard disk, and then try again       |
| File not found        | The program cannot find the file filename                                                                                        |
| Re-running setup      | The filename file is missing. Run Setup again to reinstall the missing file. For more information about running Setup, press F1. |

Consider using or adapting them in your application in similar scenarios. Only include the information that the user needs and will understand.
