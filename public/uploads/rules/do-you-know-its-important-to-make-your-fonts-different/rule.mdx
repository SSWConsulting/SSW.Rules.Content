If your styles are going to be different, then make it obvious that they are different. Don't be timid about it! This is a great time to be daring!

"Different" can mean many things: different font family, different style, different size, and different color. But the most important thing is to make it obvious that they are different.

Partial differences make people get confused and start asking things like "this looks a bit strange, but I don't know why. Is that intentional?"

Compare the follow two examples:

::: bad  
![Figure: Bad Example - The heading and body text is very simlar, only 2px font-size difference.](choosingFontsbad.png)  
:::

::: good  
![Figure: Good Example - The heading as been bolded and the content font size decreased to make it more obvious that the two are different styles.](choosingFontsgood.png)  
:::

Picking your fonts carefully applies to all forms of design where text is involved. Unfortunately, deciding what sort of differences look good and what doesn't is extremely subjective and is a skill that gets developed overtime.
