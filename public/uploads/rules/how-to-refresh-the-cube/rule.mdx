**Note:** These are instructions for TFS 2010 Beta 2

If you enter data and then look at reports you will see stale data!!!

The UI does not provide an easy option. However you have 2 \*hard\* ways of updating the TFS Data Warehouse.

**Option 1** - Open SQL Management Studio and then force re-processing\
**Option 2** - Open the TFS Web Services in IE and then force processing (Recommended - see below)

#### More info on Option 2

Follow these instructions to reprocess the data warehouse using the web services (this took us a long time to work out):

1. Open IIS Manager
2. Go to "Team Foundation Server"
3. Open the feature "Directory browsing"
4. "Enable"
5. Back to "Team Foundation Server"
6. "Browse website"
7. Browse to [http://localhost:8080/tfs/TeamFoundation/Administration/v3.0/WarehouseControlService.asmx](http://localhost:8080/tfs/TeamFoundation/Administration/v3.0/WarehouseControlService.asmx)

  showBorder={false}
  captionStyle="default"
  captionText={"You will need to call 2 of these web services"}
  src="/uploads/rules/how-to-refresh-the-cube/refresh2.jpg"
/>


8. Invoke "ProcessWarehouse" with the parameter "DefaultCollection" (or whatever your collection is called)

   
<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  captionStyle="default"
  captionText={"Call \"ProcessWarehouse\" web service with parameter \"DefaultCollection\""}
  src="/uploads/rules/how-to-refresh-the-cube/refresh3.jpg"
/>


9. Invoke "ProcessAnalysisDatabase" with parameter "Full"

   
<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  captionStyle="default"
  captionText={"Call \"ProcessAnalysisDatabase\" with parameter \"Full\""}
  src="/uploads/rules/how-to-refresh-the-cube/refresh4.jpg"
/>


10. Now once the the reprocess is completed, the reports are up to date
