By default, SharePoint diagnostic logging level was set to “Information” and “Medium”, which will log quite a big info, and it increased a log after configuring “hybrid search”:

  figureText={"default logging levels"}

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePreset="default"
  figureText={"lots of \"Medium\" level search logs"}
  src="/uploads/rules/reduce-diagnostic-logging-level-after-configure-hybrid-search/sp-diagnostic-logging-2.jpg"
/>

This made us had 60GB logs for only 14 days.
So the solution is to change to "diagnostic logging level" as below to reduce the log size:
