seoDescription: Prevent Outlook from automatically archiving emails and losing track
  of important messages by turning off AutoArchive.
title: Do you avoid using Auto Archive?
type: rule

If you use Exchange Server, Auto-Archive moves the archived items from the Exchange Server to a local drive on your notebook or desktop. While this keeps your Exchange Server nice and small, if you happen to use email to store legal documents, or want to search for emails you've sent a year ago, Auto-Archive is like throwing data away.

I promise you'll be thankful you never deleted your Sent Items.
