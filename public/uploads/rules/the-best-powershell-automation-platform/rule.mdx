PowerShell Universal is a platform to make websites, dashboards, and scripts using only PowerShell commands, without the need to have any web development knowledge, perfect for your SysAdmins.

[PowerShell Universal](https://ironmansoftware.com/powershell-universal/) is a platform built by Ironman Software that allows you to:

1. Create webpages and dashboards with PowerShell commands;
2. Orchestrate PowerShell script execution, together with auditing;
3. Use its API to communicate with the scripts and dashboards.
For example, SSW uses PowerShell Universal Dashboards to automate repeating SysAdmin tasks and create a nice user interface to run them:

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: 'Good Example - Dashboard to automate employee\'s leaving standard',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/the-best-powershell-automation-platform/automated-standard.png"
/>

Running commands directly in the PowerShell CLI without data, schedule or a nice UI is a thing of the past, and you should be using the capabilities of PowerShell Universal to keep your scripts well maintained.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: 'Bad Example - Running commands by hand directly',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/the-best-powershell-automation-platform/running-commands-hand.png"
/>
