  including staging and production.

Once you have configured “Build Once, Deploy Many” you can open the folder for any build on the build server and deploy any build, to any environment.

<endIntro />

This means that if you deploy version 37, and then want to roll back to version 36 simply open the folder for 36 and re-run that batch file (assuming there has been no breaking DB schema changes).
