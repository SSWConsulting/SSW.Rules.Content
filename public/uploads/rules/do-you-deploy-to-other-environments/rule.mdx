  body={<>
Once you have configured “Build Once, Deploy Many” you can open the folder for any build on the build server and deploy any build, to any environment.
  </>}
/>
This means that if you deploy version 37, and then want to roll back to version 36 simply open the folder for 36 and re-run that batch file (assuming there has been no breaking DB schema changes).
