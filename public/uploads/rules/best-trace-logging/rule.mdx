Did you know that writing your own logging infrastructure code wastes time? There are awesome logging abstractions in .NET Core and .NET 5+ that you should use instead!

<endIntro />


<youtubeEmbed url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pUMs8TkuMFk" description={""} />


These abstractions allow you to:

* Create log entries in a predictable and familiar fashion - you use the same patterns for logging in a [Background Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/logging?tabs=command-line&WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-33518) as you would in a [Blazor WASM app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/fundamentals/logging?view=aspnetcore-5.0&pivots=webassembly&WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-33518) (just some slightly different bootstrapping 😉)
* Use Dependency Injection; your code doesn't take a dependency on a particular framework (as they are abstractions)
* Filter output based off severity (Verbose/Debug/Info/Warning/Error) - so you can dial it up or down without changing code
* Have different logs for different components of your application (e.g. a Customer Log and an Order Log)
* Multiple logging sinks - where the logs are written to e.g. log file, database, table storage, or Application Insights
* Supports log message templates allowing logging providers to implement [semantic or structured logging](https://github.com/NLog/NLog/wiki/How-to-use-structured-logging)
* Can be used with a range of [3rd party logging providers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging/#third-party-logging-providers-1?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-33518)

```csharp
_logger.LogInformation("Getting item {Id} at {RequestTime}", id, DateTime.Now);
```
**✅ Good example - Using templates allows persisting structured log data (DateTime is a complex object)**
