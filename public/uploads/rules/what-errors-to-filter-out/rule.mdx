You should always keep on top of your RayGun crashreporting and not let the errors spiral out of control. If use RayGun with a web application, then you’ll frequently get a lot of errors with robots scanning the site and creating 404s.

<endOfIntro />

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: "Bad Example – Most of these errors are 404s cause by automated tools scanning for vulnerabilities",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/what-errors-to-filter-out/raygun-fileter-bad.png"
/>


Luckily RayGun has built-in filtering to hide these frequent exceptions.

![](/uploads/rules/what-errors-to-filter-out/raygun-filter.png)

To enable filtering:

1. Under **Crash Reporting** &gt; select **Filtering**
2. SSW recommends you turn on the following rules
   1. Discard any requesters where the user-agent is a known crawler bot
   2. Discard any request for non-existent resources (404)
   3. Discard any requests related to phpMyAdmin access attempts

Now you should have a nice clean crash report page with actual errors.

    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good example – Now that the noise is gone, we can see the actual errors",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
