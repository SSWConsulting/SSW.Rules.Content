In Azure Test Plans, each test case has configurations defined against it and these can be used to define which environments to use for a test.

<endOfIntro />

To define the configuration for a test case, select the Test Plan and go to the Define tab, then choose the "Assign Configuration" option from the appropriate test case:

  figureText={"Click on \"Assign Configuration\" from the appropriate test case"}
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-how-to-configure-which-environments-to-use-for-a-particular-test/assign-configurations.jpg"

Select the required configurations for this test case and click "Save":
