Breadcrumbs guide users through your website interactions. They are important as they give the user a sense of confidence in using your application. The user will tend to feel lost and unsure of what to do next if a application does not guide them properly. Good navigation through directional headings removes this feeling and gives the user confidence. This rule is especially important when it comes to design an e-commerce check out process, or a software set up wizard.

<endIntro />

A great wizard should includes a 'Wizard Breadcrumb', that gives the user the confidence that they are progressing as expected in the process.

It should do the following:

- Show the user **where they are up to**, **previous steps**, and the **next steps** in the process. This gives the user an idea of how long the process will take
- Allow the user to go back to previous steps allows them to change or review a previous choice

It should have the following:

- **Clear and intuitive interface** - An interface that is easy to understand and use, with clear instructions and user-friendly design
- **Step by step guidance** - Guide users through the process of setting up a new company with clear, concise instructions that are easy to follow
