The repository pattern is a great way to handle your data access layer and should be used wherever you have a need to retrieve data and turn it into domain objects.
  </>}
/>
The advantages of using a repository pattern are:

- Abstraction away from the detail of how objects are retrieved and saved
- Domain objects are ignorant of persistence - persistence is handled completely by the repository
- Testability of your code without having to hit the database (you can just mock the repository)
- Reusability of data access code without having to worry about consistency

Even better, by providing a consistent repository base class, you can get all your CRUD operations while avoiding any plumbing code.

Tip: Entity Framework provides a great abstraction for data access out of the box. See [Jason’s Clean Architecture with ASP.NET Core talk](https://tv.ssw.com/clean-architecture-with-asp-net-core-2-1-jason-taylor-ddd-sydney-2018/) for more information
