Following on from including a URL, almost every form should have a Back and an Undo button which takes you back to the previous screen, or reverses the last action. This is just like Outlook (see figure below), it has a Back button to take you to the previous folder and an Undo button.

  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: 'Good example - Back & Undo buttons in Outlook Advanced toolbar',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}

/>

**Notes:**

- "Back" button should only be implemented if different views can be shown in the same window
- Don't put "Undo" buttons on non data entry forms such as a Print Preview form

The list of forms/URLs and the order in which they have been accessed should be stored in a DataSet held in memory (like IE) - not saved to disk.

For example:

| **Menu**    | **Action**                                                       | **Undo**             | **Back**    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------- |
| Cut         | Remember: Remember Text and Cursor Position ; Cut To Clipboard | Return to Remember   | n/a         |
| Save Record | Remember old values ; Execute procCustomerSave ; Close Form  | Return to Old values | Reopen form |

Sample code implementation in the [SSW .NET Toolkit](https://ssw.com.au/ssw/NETToolkit).
