seoDescription: Turn off audio notifications on the iOS Slack app to maintain a pull-based
  system and minimize distractions.
title: Slack - Do you turn off audio notifications on the iOS app?
type: rule

One of the main strengths of Slack is that, unlike SMS, Microsoft Teams, and to some extent email, it is a pull based system, meaning that you only go to it in your own time to look at topics you’re interested in, rather than having the information pushed to you with attention grabbing notifications. For this reason, it’s important that you turn off the sounds on the iOS app, and potentially all notifications all together.
