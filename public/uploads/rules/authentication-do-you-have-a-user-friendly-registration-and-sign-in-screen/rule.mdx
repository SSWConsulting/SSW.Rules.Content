seoDescription: Ensure a user-friendly registration and sign-in process by combining
  forms on the same page, utilizing submit buttons instead of links, and providing
  clear navigation options.
title: Authentication - Do you have a user friendly registration and sign in screen?

For a website that expects a lot of first-time visitors, it is wise to put the user registration form on the same page as the sign in dialog. This saves having the user click on another link to enter their details.

The image is a bad example of a dialog box because:

* You can easily enter the correct data and click the wrong hyperlink (i.e. Join or sign in)
* By well-established convention, buttons should be used whenever form data is to be submitted back to the server
* The "Forgot my Password" link is ambiguous - Does it take me to a new page or do I have to enter the email address field first?
* A button, not a link, should be used for submitting data, as links don't allow the user to hit "enter"

/>


For a website that expects few first-time visitors, this is a good sign in screen, as it is clean and concise:

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  captionStyle="goodExample"
  caption={"Good example - friendly sign in screen for few new visitors"}
  src="/uploads/rules/authentication-do-you-have-a-user-friendly-registration-and-sign-in-screen/GoodloginScreen-few.gif"
/>


**Note:** Generally, the action buttons should be aligned to the right.
