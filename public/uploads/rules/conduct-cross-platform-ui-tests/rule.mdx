Any changes you make to your app risks breaking existing functionality. Having a suite of automated tests that you can run prior to any release reduces the risk of releasing a product with new features that don't work, or that breaks existing features. It also means that you can run these tests as part of your CI/CD pipeline.

Every control in .NET MAUI exposes the `AutomationId` property, which allows a UI testing framework to find and interact with contols. See [how you can write and run your UI tests with Appium](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/dotnet/maui-samples/uitest-appium-nunit/?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-33518).

Unlike Xamarin, .NET MAUI doesn't come with a [built-in UI testing framework - Xamarin.UITest](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/test-cloud/frameworks/uitest?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-33518). Technically, you still can use Xamarin.UITest with .NET MAUI, but only to unblock your team to migrate from Xamarin. For details, [see this video by Gerald Versluis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c2U-TzmTnQ).
