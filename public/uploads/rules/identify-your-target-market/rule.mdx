It's important to identify the market **which will gain you the maximum amount of benefit if captured.** It should be the focal point of most of your marketing efforts. The target market needs to be clearly identified with a justification as to why they are your specified target market.

At SSW our target market comprises of IT Managers and Developers who look for Microsoft backed solutions. They're the ones we focus our marketing energies on because we've found that they're the key decision makers when it comes to adopting new technologies and often act as the gate keepers to information being relayed to upper management.

If we gain their approval, it's often much easier to secure a deal. Part of our penetration strategy towards this target market is to hold [Tech Breakfasts](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Events/SSWTechBreakfast.aspx) and [User Group](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/NETUG) meetings.

For example:

When Disney releases a new blockbuster cartoon like the Lion King or Aladdin who do you think the target market is?

Many would say it's the young children that the movies are made for. But the truth is that Disney's target market often includes the decision makers - the parents who take the children to the movies and buy the merchandise.

Disney knows that it's one thing to make a great movie that kids are excited about but the efforts often fall short if parents don't approve of it.
