Pull Request templates are a great way to communicate expectations to developers. You should create different PR templates for different types of PRs. For example, you can have a PR template for bug fixes, a PR template for new features, and a PR template for refactoring. You are also able to create specific PR templates for specific code paths.

<endOfIntro />

You can read how to implement PR templates in the [GitHub Docs - Creating a pull request template for your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository).

When creating a PR template, think of how you can help developers create great PRs.

  figureText={"Bad example - There is no information to guide developers"}

  figureText={"OK example - The PR template contains handy links to guidance for creating great PRs ⭐"}

  figureText={"Good example - This PR template asks for context (to help reviewers), along with guidance links for creating great PRs ⭐"}

**Tip:** You can use comments in the Markdown as above. These comments will not show when the PR is created, and is only visible when editing the description.
