Microsoft Teams gives you the ability to sync your files to File Explorer. A lot of people don't realize this feature exits. Let's see how to do this.

Instead of going to **Teams | Files** to upload or find a file, you can:

1. Find you Team folder in Teams
2. Open the folder in SharePoint
3. Click Sync (signed on OneDrive)
4. Done - a new folder will be available in your File Explorer

Now you can manage your files just as a normal document in your machine.

::: info
**Warning:** If you don't want to be part of that Team anymore, don't delete the folder in File Explorer - This will sync with Teams and remove the files there too. You should go to **OneDrive | Settings | Stop Sync**.
