seoDescription: Mastering source control allows you to track changes, collaborate
  with team members, and recover from mistakes while keeping your code safe.

Source control is the backup of your code, as well as your tool for tracking changes over time.

With source control, we can share project code and collaborate with other team members. Using it allows us to track changes, compare code, and even roll-back if required. Moreover, it keeps our code safe and that is the most important part.

<endOfIntro />

It also helps you to do root cause analysis by finding out who made the change. Then, you can chat with them and get aligned on what caused the problem and what is the best solution moving forward. Remember, the person who made the change might have important knowledge that you don't know!

> Don't just fix the problem, see who caused the problem and correct them.
