<endIntro />

From [Adam Cogan's blog - Microsoft is onto something here
](https://www.adamcogan.com/2012/11/18/microsoft-is-onto-something-here/):

> "We now have devices from phones, tablets, work PCs and servers all with the same Metro (don't tell me to call it Modern UI please) tiled user interface.
> What that means for users is that they have the same \*one\* user experience.
> What that means for developers is that we have the simplest way to build apps that go across these 3 devices."
