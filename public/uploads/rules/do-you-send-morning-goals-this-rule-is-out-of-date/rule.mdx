(An alternative to morning goals is having [daily stand up meetings](/methodology-daily-scrums) (scrums) which is more effective for interactions between team members and the client/manager. We now prefer scrums.)

Before a day starts it is not only important to have a list of what you plan on achieving that day but to communicate that list to your manager and/or client. This not only keeps you accountable but allows your superior to change your priorities if needed.

You can use eXtreme Emails to communicate your "Morning Goals" using the following method:

* Forward the previous morning goal from yesterday, striking out completed items
* Comment (in a different colour) and give the reason whether any items were not completed
* Copy outstanding items to today's morning goals, appending any new information
* If we are working on-site we always send our morning goals from our SSW mail account, not an internal account the client may choose to give us. This enables us to keep a record of the email, and also keeps the branding consistent. If this is not possible, we always CC our SSW account (and then move the emails into your "[Saved Items](/do-you-save-important-items-in-a-separate-folder)" when you get back to the office)
* If something more important arises during the day, we note it down on the next days morning goals.
* If a task is huge (e.g. clean up my email inbox) and we only aim to do a portion of it, we say so in the morning goals as well.
