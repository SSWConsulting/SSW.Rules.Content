Users should be able to navigate around your application without having to return to the main menu to open a related form.

Think about a summary report - users should always be able to "drill-down" to track a transaction to its original source.
Think about a data entry form - users should always be able to "drill-down" to the look up table
  </>}
/>
There are four ways to provide drill-downs:

1. Preferred - Use buttons to navigate around the application


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Use named buttons to navigate around the application (Preferred)",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/DrillDownDrillAround.gif"
/>

2. Double click the control
3. Use buttons with three dots - an ellipsis (...) character

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good Example - Use ellipses to navigate around the application",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/CodeAuditorEllipses.gif"
/>

4. Use hyperlinks


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Drill-downs implemented as links (an interesting alternative but a bit too much of a visual impact)",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/AssetForm.png"
/>

Another handy thing to add for users is "drill-around". This is implemented by using a right mouse-click to activate context-sensitive links between related screens.
