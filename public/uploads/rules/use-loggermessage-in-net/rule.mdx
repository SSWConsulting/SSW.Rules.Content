Logging is a critical component in modern applications, but it can easily introduce performance overhead.

.NET 6 introduced the `LoggerMessageAttribute`, a feature in the `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` namespace that enables source-generated, highly performant logging APIs. This approach eliminates runtime overheads like boxing and temporary allocations, making it faster than traditional logging methods.

## Key performance benefits of LoggerMessageAttribute

* **Source Generation:** Automatically generates the implementation of partial methods with compile-time diagnostics.
* **Improved Performance:** Reduces runtime overhead by leveraging compile-time optimizations.
* **Flexible Usage:** Supports static and instance-based methods with configurable log levels and message templates.

## How to use LoggerMessageAttribute

Define logging methods as partial and static to trigger the code generator:

```csharp
public static partial class Log
{
    [LoggerMessage(
        EventId = 0,
        Level = LogLevel.Critical,
        Message = "Could not open socket to `{HostName}`")]
    public static partial void CouldNotOpenSocket(
        ILogger logger, string hostName);
}
```

Logging methods can also be used in an instance context by accessing an `ILogger` field or primary constructor parameter:

```csharp
public partial class InstanceLoggingExample(ILogger logger)
{
    [LoggerMessage(
        EventId = 0,
        Level = LogLevel.Critical,
        Message = "Could not open socket to `{HostName}`")]
    public partial void CouldNotOpenSocket(string hostName);
}
```

Using `LoggerMessageAttribute` with `JsonConsole` formatter can produce structured logs.
In our log messages we can specify custom event names as well as utelize string formatters:

```csharp
[LoggerMessage(
        EventId = 9,
        Level = LogLevel.Trace,
        EventName = "PropertyValueEvent")]
        Message = "In {City} the average property value is {Value:E}")]
public static partial void PropertyValueInAustralia(ILogger logger, string city double value);
```

## Constraints

When using `LoggerMessageAttribute`, ensure:

* Logging methods must be `partial` and return `void`.
* Logging method names must not start with an underscore.
* Parameter names of logging methods must not start with an underscore.
* Logging methods may not be defined in a nested type.
* Logging methods cannot be generic.
* If a logging method is `static`, the `ILogger` instance is required as a parameter.
