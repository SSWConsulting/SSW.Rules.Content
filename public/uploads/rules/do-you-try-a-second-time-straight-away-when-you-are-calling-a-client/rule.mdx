seoDescription: When calling clients, a second attempt straight away increases the
  chances of a successful connection and provides enough time for them to pick up.
title: Do you try a second time straight away when you are calling a client?

When you call a client, always try a second time straight away. Sometimes they are not at the phone, sometimes there is a technical issue or some other reason, and you should try to call again to make sure you give the client enough time to pick up your call.
