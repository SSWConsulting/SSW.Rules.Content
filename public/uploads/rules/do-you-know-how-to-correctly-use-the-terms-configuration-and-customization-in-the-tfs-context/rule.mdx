**Configuration** applies to any changes made to application settings that help to make your TFS installation work correctly for a particular environment

Configuration would apply to objects like: TFS Administration Console (SharePoint, Microsoft Test Manager (MTM), Visual Studio, Web Access, Lab Management integration), User Security, Check-in options.

**Customization** is when TFS is changed to fit into a customized process.

Customization would apply to: Changing Work Item Templates, Custom Reports, Workflow and using the API to connect to other systems.

**Extending** is a term used with CRM that includes developing Plug-in's. With TFS this is covered under Customization.

See the [CRM](/do-you-know-how-to-correctly-use-the-terms-configuration-customization-and-extending-in-the-crm-context) rule for correct definitions.
