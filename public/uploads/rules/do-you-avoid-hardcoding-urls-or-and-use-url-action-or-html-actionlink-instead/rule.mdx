seoDescription: Avoid hardcoding URLs and use Url.Action or Html.ActionLink instead

  instead?

Hard-coding URLs in your View can cause problems if your routes or page names need to change. Instead, you should always use the Url and Html helpers to refer to different pages in your MVC application.

<endOfIntro />

```html
<a href="/Rule/Create">Create a Rule</a>
```
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Figure: Bad example – Hard-coded URLs may lead to broken links if routes change",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


```cs
@Html.ActionLink("Create a Rule", "Create", "Rule")
```
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "Figure: Good example – Use the Url or Html helpers to provide links",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />
