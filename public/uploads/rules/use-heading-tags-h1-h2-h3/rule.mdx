seoDescription: Use heading tags (H1, H2, H3) where appropriate to structure your
  content and improve search engine ranking. This helps search engines understand
  the hierarchy of your page's content and gives extra weighting to text in H1 and
  H2 tags.

You should understand the hierarchy and try to use the heading tags (\<H1>, \<H2> or \<H3>...) for titles and subtitles.

The following are benefits of using heading tags:

<endIntro />

<boxEmbed
  style="warning"
  body={<>
    You should only use **one H1 tag per page**. Search engines weight this heavily and can get confused by multiple main headings.
  </>}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure=""
/>

* Improves the ranking with the search engines (extra weighting is given to text in H1 and H2)
* Makes cleaner and leaner HTML

Note: It's also important to customize these headings via CSS, making the font bigger, bold or in a different color. This way page looks nice and organized.

```html
<p>
  <span class="Heading">Introduction</span>

  Let's talk about...
</p>
```

**❌ Figure: Bad example - Using span tags and CSS classes to insert headings to content**

```html
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Let's talk about...</p>
```

**✅ Figure: Good example - Using heading tags**
