To prevent spelling or grammatical errors in the text content of a rule, you should complete the following steps:

1. Check the rule in Office Word for [spelling or grammatical errors](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/standards/rules/RulesToBetterTechnicalDocumentation.aspx#WordSpellingAndGrammarChecker) (Warning: Select the “Paste Plaintext” when pasting from Office Word to SharePoint or you will have a lot of work later to clean up the automatic generated HTML code by Office Word)
2. Run Link Auditor on that page
3. Check the report and fix the errors
4. Check in the page and repeat steps 2-3 until Link Auditor has all green ticks (alternatively, you can use "Check my links" app of Google Chrome to find the broken links)

We also have a rule: [Adding a rule in as px](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterWebsitesDevelopment.aspx#StepsAfterAddRuleOnAspxPage)![](/uploads/rules/after-adding-a-rule-on-sharepoint-what-steps-should-you-take/SPedit.jpg)**Figure: SharePoint as a content management system**
