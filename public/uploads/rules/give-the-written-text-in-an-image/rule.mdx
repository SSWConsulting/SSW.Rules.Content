Let's look at 3 examples:

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  captionStyle="badExample"
  caption={"Bad Example - this image gives no context of the surrounding areas, and without the text as well you get no google love"}
  src="/uploads/rules/give-the-written-text-in-an-image/BadExampleErrorMSG.jpg"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  captionStyle="okExample"
  caption={"OK Example - this image is great because it gives context by including the surrounding area, but you still need the text for SEO benefits"}
  src="/uploads/rules/give-the-written-text-in-an-image/OKExampleForErrorMSG.jpg"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  captionStyle="goodExample"
  caption={"Good example - if you add the image and this text above, you get full marks"}
