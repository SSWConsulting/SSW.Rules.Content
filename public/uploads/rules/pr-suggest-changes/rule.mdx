seoDescription: Learn the best practices for suggesting changes in a Pull Request
  using GitHub's 'Suggest a change' feature to streamline the review process.
title: Do you know the best way to suggest changes on a Pull Request?

Normally, the best way to provide feedback on content changes is to use the [change X to Y format](/change-from-x-to-y).
When it comes to reviewing Pull Requests (PRs) in GitHub, this is not the case - it's  inefficient for the PR owner. They have to manually interpret each suggested change, implement them in the code, and then commit the changes, which can be time-consuming.

Instead, reviewers should use GitHub's **Add a suggestion** feature. This allows the reviewer to directly suggest changes in the code diff view, and the PR creator can easily accept or reject these changes with a single click. This process is more streamlined and makes it easier to implement suggestions.

When the PR creator reviews the suggestion, they can either click **'Commit suggestion'** to apply it directly or **'Resolve conversation'** if they choose not to apply it.

If an author has made multiple suggestions to your code it may be best to add the suggestions in a batch and then. This allows you to create a single useful commit message that summarizes the changes in the feedback.
