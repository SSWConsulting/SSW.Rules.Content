Google My Business is a business listing platform provided by Google. Business owners can create or claim a previously created listing of their business.
The goal of a Google My Business (GMB) profile is to have your business known by local users (caused by brand awareness), and ultimately, increase your sales.

<endOfIntro />

By adding your business information to Google, you will:

* Have your business show up on Google Maps
* Provide important information to searchers (aka potential customers)
* Receive business reviews and build trust with your clientele

If don’t have a Google My Business profile yet, it’s unlikely your business will show up on Google Maps and be searchable by Google users. A GMB profile helps ensure that people find your business when looking for products and services like yours in their local area.

Let’s imagine a customer is trying to find your business specifically, or a similar business around their location. The customer may not be able to find you without a Google profile/listing.

Now, imagine a scenario where a listing for your business already exists, but you don’t have a profile, and therefore have no control over the information in the listing. Or worse, the information is wrong and you can’t fix it. This is why it’s critical to create a profile on GMB, or claim your business listing in your GMB profile so you can [manage it yourself](/optimize-google-my-business-profile).
