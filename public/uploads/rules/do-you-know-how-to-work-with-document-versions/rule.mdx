This is how you should work with **document versions**:

<endIntro />

1. Make sure your document library is configured to use versioning.
   **Tip:** You can configure this in **Settings | Versioning Settings**
2. Make sure you are showing the version column in your document view.
   
<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure="You can add the column by selecting Modify View"
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-how-to-work-with-document-versions/VersionColumn_Small.jpg"
/>


3. Whenever you edit the document and check it in, SharePoint will automatically increase the version number. If you need to send this document to a client then it is important to: 1. Save the file locally by selecting **Send To | Download a Copy**
   ![](/uploads/rules/do-you-know-how-to-work-with-document-versions/SaveFileLocally_Small.jpg) 2. Add the version to the end of the filename e.g. Specifications_v2.0.docx 3. Then email it to the client. 4. We do this so that we can track what version of the document was sent to the client.
   **Tip:** If you are not working with SharePoint then we recommend you [include version numbers in your file names](/show-version-numbers/).
