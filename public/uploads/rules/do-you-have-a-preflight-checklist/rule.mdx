Before starting any work, you should ensure developers take a look at your Application Insights data to make sure everything is performing correctly.

Most developers check only this first item before starting their work:

1. Check Unit Tests are Green

**Figure: Tests are green. I'm ready to start work... or am I?**

More advanced teams check their application insights data as well. This includes:

2. Look for any new Unhandled Exceptions

3. Look for any obvious performance issues (Server then client).
