Every day you will probably come across something that could be improved. If you're not making improvements, you're going backwards. But don't make suggestions or criticisms without being specific.

<!--endintro-->

# Be specific

::: greybox
"Do you know our sales process is pretty bad, what are you going to do about it?"
:::

::: bad
Figure: Bad Example - Nonspecific criticism
:::

When you find a problem, pinpoint it directly (and recommend a solution):

::: greybox
"The current sales process is pretty bad. It does not ensure that a prospect is followed up by a phone call within 7 days of an initial meeting. Please create a workflow in CRM, have it tested by the sales manager, and then we will email the sales team to inform them about the improvement."
:::

::: good
Figure: Good Example - Offering criticism in this way ensures that something will happen to fix the problem
:::  

::: greybox
"Not done, please try again"

:::

::: bad
Figure: Bad Example - If they don't immediately know what to fix, this might end up in their "too hard" bucket and never get done
:::

::: greybox
"Not done, you missed the second requirement"
:::

::: good
The specific missed requirement lets them quickly fix the mistake
:::  

Of course, there are times that you can 'feel' that a problem exists, but you may not even be sure how are unable to pinpoint it or can't think of a good solution. In this instance you should speak to someone who you think may be able to identify a solution, come to an agreement, and then request that action be taken.

When criticism is generic, it is impossible to know what to fix.

# Videos - Use timecodes

When giving feedback on a video recording, always use timecodes to specify what should be fixed.

::: greybox
❌ Shaky camera \
❌ You mentioned "we did a POC" - I would stay generic and say "Here's a demo of what we did"\
❌ Slight sound desync
:::

::: bad
Figure: Bad Example - No timecodes so it's hard to go back and fix without re-watching the whole video
:::

::: greybox
❌ **0:10 to 1:00** - Shaky camera\
❌ **1:04** - You mentioned "we did a POC" - I would stay generic and say "Here's a demo of what we did"\
❌ **4:12 to 6:01** - Slight sound desync
:::

::: good
Figure: Good Example - timecodes specifically say when to look for the mistake

*ℹ️ Note: You can also use 1'10" notation (' minutes and " seconds) but it isn't considered an industry standard.*

# Consider Context

It's also important to consider both your audience and the overall context.  

* Internally, you might assess the work on a scale of 1 to 10 (without sharing the score).
* If the work rates a 9/10 or higher, feedback is generally unnecessary. Moving from a 9/10 to a 10/10 often requires incremental feedback that can feel overly critical.
* While aiming for a 10/10 is ideal, it's often acceptable to settle for a 9/10 if the effort to achieve perfection isn't justified.  

:::greybox
*I hope people ask for a ‘Checked By’ when it is at least a 7/10.
Then I hope the feedback gets it to a 9/10, if not a 10.*
