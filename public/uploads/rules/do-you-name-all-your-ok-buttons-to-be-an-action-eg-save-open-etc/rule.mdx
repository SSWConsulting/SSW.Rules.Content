If your form has an "OK" button it should be renamed to be as an action verb. For example: Save, Open, etc.

  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure='Bad example - "OK" button which is not an action'

<imageEmbed

  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure='Good example - "Save" button which is an action'

We have a program called [SSW Code Auditor](https://ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/Rules.aspx#OkButtonsAction) to check for this rule.
