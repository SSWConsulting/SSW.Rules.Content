The goal is to have a presenter give the editor zero cuts. Editors should inform the speaker when they have to clean up their presentation in post-production (and you think they would likely make the same mistake again next time).

When the editor hits an issue, talk to the speaker, show them the problem and make them practice doing it again, the right way until  you give them a 'pass'.

Now you can hope they won't do it next time, and you won't need to do an edit.
