When you create a new git repository and need to push it to VSTS you need to provide login credentials.

It isn't always clear how to do this.

Instead, you should use Personal Access Token. You can do this in two ways.

The first option is to make sure your Git for Windows is up-to-date and when cloning the repository, you use Microsoft Account to log in. Personal Access Token for Git will be created for you.

    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/connect-to-vsts-git-with-personal-access-tokens/git-credentials-personal-access-token.png"
/>

Option 2 is to manually create Personal Access Token and use it as a password for Git login.
