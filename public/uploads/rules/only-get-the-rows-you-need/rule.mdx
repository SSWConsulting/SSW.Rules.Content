<introEmbed
  body={<>
It's expensive retrieving data from a database, as such it's important to only ask for the rows you require when getting data.
  </>}
/>
Entity Framework nicely translates the various filters like the Where method into SQL WHERE clauses. This makes it really easy to write nice readable code that is also very efficient.

```csharp
List<Sale> sales = context.Sales.ToList();
foreach (var sale in sales)
{
    if (sale.ProductId == request.ProductId)
    {
        // Do stuff
    }
}
```

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Bad example - Retrieved all the data instead of items that matched the product id.",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


```csharp
List<Sale> sales = context.Sales
      .Where(sale => sale.ProductId == Request.ProductId)
      .ToList();

foreach (var sale in sales)
{
    // Do stuff
}
```

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "Good example - Only the data required was retrieved from the database",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />
