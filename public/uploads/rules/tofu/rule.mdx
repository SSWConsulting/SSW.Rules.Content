Tasks often stall when responsibility isn’t actively managed. When working on a task, you may need to wait on others before you can move forward. In those situations, it’s easy to delegate and forget, causing the task to stall.

No one is more invested in unblocking a task than the person responsible for it. That's why it's important to follow the **Take Ownership and Follow Up (TOFU)** principle.

<endIntro />

That means being accountable for the task and following up with the people you’re waiting on until it’s completed.

> It’s not just about delegation; it’s about delegation and follow-up.\

## What TOFU involves

There are 2 main aspects to TOFU:

* **Taking Ownership** - Giving timely honest updates to stakeholders about progress
* **Following up** - Proactively communicating with blockers (ideally chase them at least once a day)

## Why it's important

* **Accountability** - The TOFU principle fosters a culture of accountability, where individuals feel personally invested in the outcome of their work.
* **Clarity** - Regular follow-ups provide clarity to all stakeholders, keeping everyone informed about progress, challenges, and changes.
* **Trust** - Demonstrating reliability through consistent follow-up strengthens trust among team members and with clients or stakeholders.

## How to do it effectively

1. **Acknowledge and accept** - When a task is assigned to you, acknowledge it promptly, and ensure you understand the requirements. If anything is unclear, seek clarification immediately
2. **Communicate proactively** - Don't wait for someone to ask for an update. Regularly communicate your progress, especially if you encounter any roadblocks or delays
3. **Set clear deadlines** - Establish realistic deadlines for your tasks and communicate these with your team and stakeholders. If a deadline needs to be adjusted, communicate this change as early as possible
4. **Use tools to your advantage** - Understand the best ways for [following up effectively](/follow-up-effectively) and leverage Scrum tools (e.g., Azure DevOps, GitHub, Trello) to track tasks, deadlines, and progress
5. **Close the loop** - Once a task is completed, ensure all relevant parties are informed and that any necessary documentation is updated. Closing the loop is a critical part of the follow-up process, as it signifies that no further action is required. The way to do this for a task you received via email is to [send a Done email](/reply-done-and-delete-the-email/). For tasks (e.g. a PBI) outside an email it is usually to [add a comment](/close-pbis-with-context/)

## ⚠️ Common pitfalls to avoid

* **Overcommitting** - Only take ownership of tasks you have the bandwidth to manage. Overcommitting can lead to missed deadlines and decreased quality of work
* **Under-communicating** - Assuming others are aware of your progress or challenges without regular updates can lead to misunderstandings and delays
* **Neglecting the big picture** - While focusing on your tasks, don't lose sight of how they fit into the larger goals and timelines

The TOFU principle encourages reliable, transparent, and efficient work. Consistent use improves project delivery, team collaboration, and individual growth.
