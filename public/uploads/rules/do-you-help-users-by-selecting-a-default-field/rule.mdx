Help your users by setting the default field when your MVC Website loads.

By selecting a default field for your users when a page loads you can improve the usability of your website by reducing the amount of steps needed to perform a task.
  </>}
/>
Here is a way to do this with MVC 3 and Razor:

1. Add a div with a class around the field you want to set focus on

```html
<div class="focus">
    @Html.EditorFor(model => model.FirstName)
    @Html.ValidationMessageFor(model => model.FirstName)
</div>
```

2. Then use jQuery to select the class and set focus:

```html
$(function() {
    $('.focus :input').focus();
});
```
