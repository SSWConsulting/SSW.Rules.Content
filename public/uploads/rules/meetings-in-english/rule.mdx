When meetings are recorded or shared with colleagues across different offices, using a language other than English creates a barrier for team members who can't understand it. This prevents important information from being accessible to all stakeholders, especially those in the main offices who need to review or understand the meeting content.

<!--endintro-->

Always conduct meetings in English when:

- The meeting is being recorded
- The meeting includes or may be shared with colleagues from other offices
- The meeting discusses company-wide topics or decisions
