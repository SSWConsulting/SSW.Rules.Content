## Extra: Use a different text formatting

To make your messages more visually appealing, you can use "> &#123;&#123; MESSAGE &#125;&#125;" in Microsoft Teams chats to highlight your message as a quote. This works particularly well when you want to refer to an email subject, i.e:

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good example - Mentioning an email using the \"> &#123;&#123; MESSAGE &#125;&#125;\" formatting",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/refer-to-email-subject/good-example---use-formatting.png"
/>
