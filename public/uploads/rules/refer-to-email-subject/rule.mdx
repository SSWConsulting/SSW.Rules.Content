Use IM to chase up that important email. You can make it easy for everyone by pasting the email subject for context.

<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    I sent you an email just now, please approve
  </>}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure=""
/>
**❌ Figure: Bad example - client need to filter his emails manually**  


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    I need you to reply to my email... Subject: CBA Software Audit
  </>}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure=""
/>
**✅ Figure: Good example - client can search your email based on the subject**  

## Extra: Use a different text formatting

To make your messages more visually appealing, you can use "> &#123;&#123; MESSAGE &#125;&#125;" in Microsoft Teams chats to highlight your message as a quote. This works particularly well when you want to refer to an email subject, i.e:

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure='Good example - Mentioning an email using the "> &#123;&#123; MESSAGE &#125;&#125;" formatting'
