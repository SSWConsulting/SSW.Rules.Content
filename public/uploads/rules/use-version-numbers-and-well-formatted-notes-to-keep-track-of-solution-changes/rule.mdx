Dynamics uses a solution as a logical container to hold all customizations for a given function or sub-function. It is very important to have a versioning strategy around changes and when to increment versions.
  </>}
/>
Increment the version \*every time\* a change is made and add a new line at the top of the description field containing:

1. New version number
2. Developer initials
3. Change notes, can changes, removals, additions to the solution

This gives you a quick and easy reference for the changes that have happened in the solution. Following this standard means comparing solutions across environments is a painless process.
