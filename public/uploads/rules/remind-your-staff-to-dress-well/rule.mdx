Sometimes people may need a reminder to follow the dress code. If you notice someone is not dressed accordingly:

**Tip:** If there is someone you need to constantly remind, a great way to get them to remember is to tell them about helping with [reduce admin pain](/reduce-your-admin) and keep them accountable.
