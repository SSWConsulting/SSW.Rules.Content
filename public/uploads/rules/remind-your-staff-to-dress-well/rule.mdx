The way you and all members of your team present themselves is a crucial part of creating a good impression for your clients, particularly in their first encounters with you.

<endOfIntro />

Sometimes people may need a reminder to follow the dress code. If you notice someone is not dressed accordingly:

1. Speak to them in person or send them a gentle reminder with a link to your dress code.

**Tip:** If there is someone you need to constantly remind, a great way to get them to remember is to tell them about helping with [reduce admin pain](/reduce-your-admin) and keep them accountable.
