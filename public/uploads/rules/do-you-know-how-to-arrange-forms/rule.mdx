There are two ways of arranging labels and inputs on an html form, but each should be used in a specific scenario.
  </>}
/>
When arranging labels and inputs on your html form, align labels next to the inputs on medium and large displays.


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'Labels besides their respective inputs on regular displays',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-how-to-arrange-forms/forms-desktop.jpg"
/>

When arranging labels and inputs on your html form, align labels above inputs on small and extra-small displays.


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'Labels above their respective input on smaller displays',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-how-to-arrange-forms/forms-mobile.jpg"
