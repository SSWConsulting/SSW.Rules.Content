There are two ways of arranging labels and inputs on an html form, but each should be used in a specific scenario.
  </>}
/>
When arranging labels and inputs on your html form, align labels next to the inputs on medium and large displays.


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Labels besides their respective inputs on regular displays",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-how-to-arrange-forms/forms-desktop.jpg"
/>


When arranging labels and inputs on your html form, align labels above inputs on small and extra-small displays.


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Labels above their respective input on smaller displays",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-how-to-arrange-forms/forms-mobile.jpg"
