There are two ways of arranging labels and inputs on an html form, but each should be used in a specific scenario.

<endIntro />

When arranging labels and inputs on your html form, align labels next to the inputs on medium and large displays.

<imageEmbed alt="Image" size="large" showBorder={false} figurePrefix="none" figure="Labels besides their respective inputs on regular displays" src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-how-to-arrange-forms/forms-desktop.jpg" />

When arranging labels and inputs on your html form, align labels above inputs on small and extra-small displays.

<imageEmbed alt="Image" size="large" showBorder={false} figurePrefix="none" figure="Labels above their respective input on smaller displays" src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-how-to-arrange-forms/forms-mobile.jpg" />

Bootstrap makes this easy. Read [Do you use the css class "form horizontal" to arrange your fields and labels?](/do-you-use-the-css-class-form-horizontal-to-arrange-your-fields-and-labels) to know more.
