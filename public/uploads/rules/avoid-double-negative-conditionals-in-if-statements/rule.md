Try to avoid Double-Negative Conditionals in if-statements. Double negative conditionals are difficult to read because developers have to evaluate which is the positive state of two negatives. So always try to make a single positive when you write if-statement.

```cs
if (!IsValid)
{
        // handle error
}
else
{
       // handle success
}
```

Figure: Bad example

```cs
if (IsValid)
{
       // handle success
}
else
{
       // handle error
}

```cs
if (!IsValid)

```

Use pattern matching for boolean evaluations to make your code even more readable!

```cs
if (IsValid is false)
{
       // handle error
}
```
