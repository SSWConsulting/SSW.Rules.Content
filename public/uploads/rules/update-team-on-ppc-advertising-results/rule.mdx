To see how to create a campaign and to use it effectively, please read all [Rules to Better Google Ads](/rules-to-better-google-ads).

It is recommended to use Google Ads (before known as Google Adwords), to advertise our company, products, training, and events. It is a paid advertising product that promotes your business whenever people are searching Google. You only need to pay when someone clicks on your ad, which is known as cost-per-click (CPC) advertising. It is a great tool for directing more traffic to your website and expanding your brand awareness.

Every month, you should send out a Google Ads report to the relevant stakeholders with screenshots of your Marketing Dashboard (e.g. Using Power BI).

Make sure to include:

- Number of opportunities vs. number of conversions that came through our Google Ads
- Compare results for the month in the current and previous year: clicks, impressions, the average cost per click, and cost
  - Explain why it increased or dropped
- Add information about best campaigns and keywords, if any of them had a special improvement or was on 'the spotlight' during that month
- Mention in percentage where sessions on our website came from. They could come from: Direct, organic, referral, paid ads, social media, and emails (newsletter). Findm this at **Google Analytics | Acquisition | Overview**
- Add graphics to illustrate your report. Use Google Ads or Power BI for cool screenshots

If you have any further relevant information, make sure to include it in the montly reports as well.
