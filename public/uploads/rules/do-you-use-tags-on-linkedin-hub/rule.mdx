Even with a great ATS, reporting on recruitment can be difficult. Tags are a great way to not only track your progress, but they can also help you do some tracking on things like the calls you team are making.

<endIntro />

To add Tags on LinkedIn Hub:

1. Go to your Product Settings | Tags | Add New
2. Enter a name for your new tag | Add

You can then use your tags on the profiles of your candidates to show what action has taken place:

1. Go to the tags box in the candidate profile
2. Start to type the tag you need | click on the tag in the drop down
3. If you don't know which one to use you can "Show all tags"
