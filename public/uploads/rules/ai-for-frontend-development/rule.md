AI‑assisted tools can turn rough ideas into working demos in hours instead of weeks. They help you scaffold codebases, generate UI from prompts or designs, and wire up data so you can validate scope and risk with clients quickly.

## Tooling Options

Here is a list of AI code generation tools:

:::info
These tools keep getting better - what they can do changes quickly.
:::

* [Github Spark](https://github.com/features/spark) (Copilot Pro+ only)

  GitHub Spark is an AI‑powered app builder that turns natural language instructions into full‑stack TypeScript/React apps, complete with live preview and GitHub repo integration. It’s tightly integrated with GitHub Copilot and Codespaces, making it easy to go from idea → prototype → hosted demo quickly. Spark is perfect for building end‑to‑end demos directly within the GitHub ecosystem.

* [Base44](https://base44.com)

  Base44 focuses on full‑stack scaffolding. By simply describing your app, it spins up CRUD operations, authentication, forms, and basic data flows. It’s particularly helpful when you need a working skeleton to show user journeys or data interactions during client presentations.

* [v0](https://v0.dev)

  v0 by Vercel is a UI‑focused generator that outputs production‑ready React and Tailwind components. It’s a great option when you need to iterate on design directions quickly or want to build out front‑end layouts that work seamlessly with Next.js projects.

* [Firebase Studio](https://firebase.studio)

  Firebase Studio leverages AI to help you scaffold backends, define Firestore data models, generate security rules, and create sample data. It’s ideal when your prototype needs authentication, cloud functions, and real‑time data syncing without heavy backend setup.

* [Lovable](https://lovable.dev)

  Lovable focused on responsive design. It helps you generate front-end and full-stack applications that adapt seamlessly from desktop to mobile. You can start from a prompt, an image, or directly from a Figma file. It's especially useful when you need polished, responsive layouts that work across screen sizes out of the box.

* [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new)

  Bolt.new supports multiple frameworks beyond React, such as Vue, Svelte, and Angular. It offers terminal access for running specific commands and supports integrated deployment, so you can go from prompt (or even an image) to a live site in minutes. Ideal for quick prototyping in non-React stacks or showcasing cross-framework concepts.

* [Anima](https://www.animaapp.com)

  Anima specializes in turning high-fidelity designs into near pixel-perfect React, HTML, and CSS code. It integrates directly with tools like Figma, Sketch, and Adobe XD via plugins, making it easy to export real, production-grade code from your design files. It's a great choice when visual accuracy and front-end alignment with design specs are a top priority in your prototypes.

* [Uizard](https://uizard.io)

  Uizard acts like a pseudo-designer, allowing you to quickly generate multi-page UI designs from prompts or even screenshots. It supports exporting to code, making it ideal for rapid prototyping or client-facing mockups without needing full design expertise. It's especially handy for quickly visualizing product ideas or user flows in minutes.

## ✅ Best Use Cases for AI Tools

### Rapid prototyping and design exploration

Non-technical team members can use screenshots, hand-drawn wireframes, or Figma files to create functional prototypes. These tools allow quick iteration, fast feedback, and better alignment across teams early in the design process.

### Kick starting new projects

Use AI-generated code as a base to accelerate development. Many tools produce clean, component-based layouts that follow design principles and give developers a working foundation — helping teams skip repetitive boilerplate and focus on core features.

### Going from idea to deployment

Some tools like v0 and base44 can take a project from wireframe to a deployed demo with minimal effort. This helps teams validate concepts with stakeholders, collect feedback, and iterate fast — bridging the gap between idea and implementation.

### Replicating and reusing UI patterns

AI tools like v0 or Anima are great for extracting patterns from reference sites — e.g., navigation, pricing tables, or forms — and turning them into working components. These can be integrated into your design system, refined, and styled to meet brand or accessibility standards.

## ❌ What to Avoid When Using AI Tools

AI tools are great for prototypes, but they do not replace good software engineering. Here are common mistakes to avoid:

### Treating prototypes as production code

AI-generated code is built for speed, not safety or scalability. It often lacks error handling, validation, and test coverage. Shipping this code directly to production can lead to security issues, crashes, and long-term maintenance problems. Always treat prototypes as drafts — they must be reviewed and hardened before deployment.

### Skipping human review

AI can generate structured code, but it doesn’t understand your business logic or security standards. That’s why every AI-generated change should be reviewed — especially pull requests or multi-file edits. Never auto-merge AI output. A human eye helps catch logic bugs, performance issues, and unsafe assumptions.

### Uploading real client data

Do **not** paste real or sensitive client data into prompts or online AI tools. Most tools process data in the cloud, and unless there’s a verified agreement in place, you risk a data breach or compliance violation. Always use fake or anonymized data during prototyping.

### Ignoring licensing and attribution

Some generated content may be derived from licensed or attributed sources. Before using AI-generated code or media in a project, always verify its origin and license. This is especially important if your prototype is going to production or reused in commercial contexts.

## Example of prompt and the result

::: greybox
I need a pricing page with 4 options in columns ending with enterprise.\
I would like a toggle at the top to change from monthly to annual.\
I would like it in orange, black and white.
