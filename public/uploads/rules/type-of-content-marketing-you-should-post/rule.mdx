### 9 - General content written/followed by your team

It can be a blog post or one of the many useful SSW Rules - these are best practices that are worth sharing with everyone.

If your company follows an SSW rule, then share it on your social media too. Use **\#ssw** and **\#sswrules** so readers can find more!
