A great way to increase your overall audience, as well as your attendance at each User Group, is to use social media and online forums like MeetUp to advertize your events.

You can use MeetUp, as well as the social media platforms, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn to announce all of our upcoming User Groups and keep track of attendance.
