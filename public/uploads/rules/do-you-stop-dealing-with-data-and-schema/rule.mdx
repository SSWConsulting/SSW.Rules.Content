Why don't most developers plan ahead? Take an average Desktop application that you sell to a few customers. When the customer wants a new version, there is no problem giving the customer the new exe. But what if you made a back-end structural [changes to your database](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/DataSchemaStandard.aspx)? Big hassle! You need to compare the database to remind you what was changed. Sure there are utilities for this - for Access back ends you can use [SSW Data Renovator](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/DeveloperAccess/WhyDataRenovator.aspx) or for SQL Server back ends there is [Red-gate SQL Compare](https://www.red-gate.com/products/#1) - but why go to this trouble?

Version control for your Schema and where required your Data should be an important part of planning your projects.
