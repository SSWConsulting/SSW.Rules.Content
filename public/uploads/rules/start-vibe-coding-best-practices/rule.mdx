Vibe coding empowers non-developers to build software using AI agents. However, without proper foundation and structure, vibe coding can result in unmaintainable code that fails "the bus test" – meaning if you were hit by a bus tomorrow, no one else could understand or maintain your code.

<endOfIntro />

The key to successful vibe coding is starting with the right foundation. This means ensuring your code lives in a proper repository, uses proven architectural patterns, and leverages existing AI guidance.

## Start in GitHub
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Starting with code on your local machine or in an unmanaged environment",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "Create your repository in the [SSWConsulting GitHub organization](https://github.com/SSWConsulting) from the start",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


Starting your project in GitHub, specifically within your organization, ensures:

* **Version control** - Every change is tracked and can be reverted
* **Collaboration** - Others can contribute and review your code
* **Backup** - Your code is safely stored in the cloud
* **Transparency** - Team members can see what you're building
* **The bus test** - If you're unavailable, others can take over

## Use architecture templates

Don't start from scratch! Use one of these battle-tested SSW templates that already include comprehensive AI guidance:

### Clean Architecture Template

Use the [SSW Clean Architecture template](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.CleanArchitecture) which includes:

* Proper separation of concerns (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation layers)
* Built-in dependency injection
* Comprehensive `agents.md` files guiding AI on architectural decisions
* `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot integration
* Pre-configured with best practices and patterns

  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>


### Vertical Slice Architecture Template

Alternatively, use the [SSW Vertical Slice Architecture template](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.VerticalSliceArchitecture) which offers:

* Feature-focused organization (each slice is a complete vertical through all layers)
* Easier to understand for non-developers
* AI guidance files pre-configured
* Less ceremony than Clean Architecture for simpler projects
* Faster to get started with

  figureEmbed={{

    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>



<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    **Which template should I use?**

* Choose **Clean Architecture** if you need more structure and guardrails
* Choose **Vertical Slice Architecture** if you want to move fast and iterate quickly
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>


See the [software architecture decision tree](/software-architecture-decision-tree) for more guidance on choosing the right architecture.

## Drive development from GitHub Copilot Workspaces

Once your repository is set up with a template, use [GitHub Copilot Workspaces](https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-workspace) to drive your development:

1. **Open your repository in GitHub Copilot Workspace** - This gives the AI full context of your codebase
2. **Describe what you want to build** - Use natural language to explain your feature or change
3. **Review the AI's plan** - The AI will propose changes based on your architecture template and existing code patterns
4. **Let the AI implement** - Copilot Workspace will make the changes directly in your repository
5. **Create a Pull Request** - Review the changes before merging to main


<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    "Add a user registration feature with email and password"
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good example - Clear requirement that the AI can implement following the template's patterns",
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
/>


## Why this approach passes the bus test

By following these practices, your vibe-coded project will be:

✅ **Maintainable** - Following proven architecture patterns
✅ **Understandable** - Using standard structures that developers recognize
✅ **Documented** - Architecture decisions are encoded in the template
✅ **Reviewable** - All changes go through pull requests
✅ **Professional** - Indistinguishable from code written by experienced developers

    **Remember:** The goal isn't just to make code work – it's to create code that others can understand, maintain, and extend. Starting with these best practices ensures your vibe coding produces professional-quality software.
