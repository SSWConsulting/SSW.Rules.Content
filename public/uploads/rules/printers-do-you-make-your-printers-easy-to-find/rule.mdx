seoDescription: Easily find and connect to printers from outside the domain with a
  simple DNS alias setup.
title: Printers - Do you make your Printers easy to find?

For PCs that are not in the domain, the printers won’t be automatically installed.

So you should add a DNS alias which maps \\printer to your print server.
