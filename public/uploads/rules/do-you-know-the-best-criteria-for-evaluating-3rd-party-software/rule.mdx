At SSW we evaluate and use a lot of 3rd party libraries. Before considering a library for further evaluation we ask the following questions:
  </>}
/>
- Is it open source?
- Is the licence LGPL, Apache, or MIT? [Comparison of licences](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_software_licenses)
- Is there a quick start guide?
- Is there a FAQ?
- Is there an API guide?
- Is it easy to install? Is there a NuGet package?
- Is there an active user community?

If the answer is yes to all of these questions then the library is definitely worth further evaluation.
