Single page applications (SPAs) are getting more and more popular, and for good reason – a better and faster user experience, reduced server load and encourages good API separation.

But have you ever visited a website, thought “I’ll refresh that” and then got taken back to the home screen? Or tried to copy or bookmark the URL, only to find it’s just “/Home”? This happens when client-side routing hasn’t been implemented properly and is a big hit to a site’s usability.

This is easily fixed with Angular ’s routing capabilities, and implementing it in your SPA will confer several advantages:

- URLs can be copy-pasted and shared
- Page refreshes work as expected
- Less prone to errors
- Better separation of concerns (navigation vs page state)

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: 'Bad example - The blog post component is choosing components based on the state of the component',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-client-side-routing/client-side-bad.png"
/>

A better way is to set up routes, and use a router (the first-party component router is great for this) to manage your components:

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: '![Good: Setting up declarative routes and outlets gives a good user experience, persistent URLs, and fewer moving parts](/uploads/rules/use-client-side-routing/client-side-good.png)',
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />
