As a consultant, it is important to realise that all of your time is valuable.

<!--endintro-->

In the situation where you are at a client site and your time is being billed, don't be conscientious and quiet. You need to make sure that there are no bottlenecks slowing you down. Make sure you have everything you need and, if you need to ask a question, keep asking until you get an answer.

Clients will always prefer a slight irritation at the time rather than an inflated invoice with no result later on.
