ScreenCloud gives you two key building blocks for signage content: Playlists and Channels. If you pick the wrong one early, your signage becomes hard to scale, hard to update, and inconsistent across screens.

A simple way to think about it:

* Playlists are where you organize content into a reusable set (in a defined order).
* Channels are where you schedule and publish content to screens (and keep it consistent).

ScreenCloud even runs a webinar specifically to help clarify when/how to use each - you can find it on [Channels and Playlists: Best Practices](https://screencloud.com/webinars/productivity/channels-and-playlists-best-practices)

## ❌ The Pain

When content is added directly into Channels (e.g. individual product slides, individual pages, individual apps), it usually leads to:

* Duplicate content across multiple Channels
* Painful updates (you must fix the same thing in many places)
* Inconsistent messaging between locations / screen groups
* Fragile setups when ownership changes (“who maintains this Channel again?”)

### ✅ Best Practice

Use Playlists as your “unit of ownership”, and Channels as your “broadcast surface”

In ScreenCloud Channels, the media picker lets you add different content types – including Playlists, media, links, and apps – into a Channel.

That means you can structure things cleanly:

* Playlists: reusable building blocks (owned by a team or topic)
* Channels: where those building blocks are assembled + scheduled

To do that:

1. Create one Playlist per product (or topic / “content module”)
2. Add the product content to the Playlist (not the Channel)
3. Build Channels by combining Playlists
4. When a product changes, update the Playlist once and all Channels that use it will inherit the change

## How to create a Playlist and Channel

<imageEmbed alt="ScreenCloud Playlist" size="large" showBorder={false} figurePrefix="good" figure="Good Example - Creating a new Playlist" src="/uploads/rules/screencloud-channels-playlists/screencloud-playlist.png" />

#### ➕ [Playlist](https://help.screencloud.com/en/articles/10120006-screencloud-studio-playlists)

1. In ScreenCloud | left bar | Playlists | New Playlist
2. Standardize Playlist naming (so it's easier to understand later) e.g. 01-{{ProductName}} (04-SSW\.Rules)
3. Add the content to your playlist e.g. Page Scroll, Dashboard, PowerBI
4. Publish

This will create a new playlist with your content.

#### ➕ [Channel](https://help.screencloud.com/en/articles/10110358-channels-setup-guide-scheduling-content-using-layouts-and-adding-music-to-your-screens)

1. In ScreenCloud | left bar | Channels | New Channel
2. Add the Playlists you just created to your channel
3. Publish
4. Add/assign/embed the channel somewhere to start showing it to your audience
