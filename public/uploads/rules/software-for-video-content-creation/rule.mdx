There are a few options when it comes to the best software for editing video content, e.g. creating YouTube videos.

When creating video content, the most popular editing workflows are:

- Adobe Premiere Pro (editor) and After Effects (motion graphics)
- DaVinci Resolve (editor) and Fusion (motion graphics)
- Final Cut Pro (editor) and Apple Motion (motion graphics)

<endIntro />

Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects is the most popular workflow as it works with both PC and Mac ecosystems, and allows integration with additional Adobe creative cloud tools (e.g. Audition, Photoshop, Illustrator, and more).
The software is user friendly and allows for a great deal of customization with layouts and third-party plug-ins that can help to significantly improve your editing workflow.

DaVinci Resolve is the fastest growing editing software, and can be used for free (there is a paid Studio upgrade, but the free version is suitable for most editors and projects).
It started as a colour-grading tool and then was developed into a full editing software solution, so some editing elements are not as user friendly as other editors, but once you are used to the platform is it a solid choice.
DaVinci is made by Blackmagic Design from Melbourne, Australia.

Final Cut Pro is an Apple exclusive workflow, which means that it is not suited to teams with PC/Windows ecosystems. The benefit of this is that Final Cut is continually optimized for Apple’s hardware, so it is a good choice if you work on a Mac and use footage in the ProRes codec.

**Note:** Avid Media Composer is another video editing software that is still used for TV series and movies, but it has a steep learning curve and is not popular for YouTube content creators.
