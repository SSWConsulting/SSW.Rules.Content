The PR author is responsible to [follow up](/tofu) and get PRs merged as soon as possible. An "over-the-shoulder" review is one of the best ways to [avoid merge debt](/merge-debt).

When a pull request (PR) is ready to be reviewed, get someone with you either in-person or on call, and go through the PR together. This not only allows you to demo the content of the PR but also talk with the person taking feedback when needed.

## Drafting PRs

A good way to avoid someone merging your PR before you have done an over the shoulder review is to keep the Pull Request in draft mode until you are ready for it to be reviewed for merging.
