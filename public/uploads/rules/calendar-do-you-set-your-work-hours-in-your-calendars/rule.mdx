Setting up an Outlook calendar can be highly beneficial not just for you, but also for others who need to see your availability. By sharing your calendar with your colleagues, they can easily see when you are free or busy and can schedule meetings or appointments with you.

This can avoid scheduling conflicts, especially when different people work different hours. For example, if the company has standard hours (9am to 6pm), when someone is working different hours (say 8am to 5pm) it is desirable to have this visible in Outlook for others making an appointment.

* **Outlook & Outlook on the web:** Go to **Settings | Calendar | Work hours and location**
* **Teams:** Go to **Calendar | Calendar Settings | Work hours and location**

2. While you're here, why not set your location as well - as per: [Calendar - Do you set your working location?](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/set-working-location/)[](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/set-working-location/)
