It is important to be able to easily share files between workers. It is also important that all content is backed up centrally in case an employee is unavailable.

Ideally SharePoint would be used for all content storage but occasionally it is not ideal.

Having the folder on the remote machine allows remote backup. All folders used for SSW Work must be shared with the SSW Dropbox Account.
The SSW sys-admin is responsible for backing up the SSW Dropbox account daily.
