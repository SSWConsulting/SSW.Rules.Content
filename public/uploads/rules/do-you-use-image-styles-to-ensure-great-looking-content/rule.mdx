Many people will simply "plonk" an image onto a web page in between or next to a block of text. This interrupts the flow of the page and gives a disjointed, unprofessional impression.

A good technique is to set a CSS style to images. This style will be consistent and easy to be used by any person who might edit the website content.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: 'Bad example - The image has no styles',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: 'Good example - The image has CSS driven margin, padding, borders',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}

/>

It's also important to choose the correct semantic formatting for images. Different HTML codes might give the same look and feel, but the [best way to add images to your site](/use-the-right-html-figure-caption) is using **&lt;dl&gt;**, **&lt;dt&gt;**, and **&lt;dd&gt;** tags.
