seoDescription: ASP.NET and SharePoint development differ in source control systems,
  with ASP.NET typically using TFS for code management and SharePoint utilizing its
  own document control and version history.
title: ASP.NET vs SharePoint development - Do you know source control is different?

**In ASP.NET** - Typically, the team will store the code on a source control system such as TFS (Team Foundation Server), check it out to their own local system, develop and test locally then check it back into source control for sharing.

**In SharePoint** - SharePoint comes with its own document control and version history out of the box. This is great for collaborating between developers and designers, but isn’t available for everything.

**Differences** - Unlike TFS, SharePoint does not support multiple check-out so each file can only be checked out to one person at a time.  The modification must be checked back into SharePoint.

We think the following are best tracked on a development SharePoint server:

* Master page
* Page Layouts
* XSL
* CSS

And these should not (or cannot) be version controlled on SharePoint server:

* Low level customizations such as custom web parts should still be developed in VS.NET and stored in TFS
* Package files to build solution packages should be stored in TFS
