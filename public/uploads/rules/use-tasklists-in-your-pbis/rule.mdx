There are many ways to write tasks in PBIs, but the best way is to use tasklists. This allows you to see the progress of the PBI at a glance as well as avoid any unintentional tasks being tracked. Below is the different ways you could write tasks in PBIs.

### Numbering tasks

When sending tasks in email, you might [number your tasks](/number-tasks-questions/) to make it clear what you want.

  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'Numbering tasks in PBIs works but isn\'t fully utilizing the platform',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-tasklists-in-your-pbis/numbering-tasks.jpg"
/>

Although this would work in PBIs, it's not the best way to do it in GitHub.

### Using checklists

You can use checkboxes in PBIs to create a checklist for tasks


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'You can click the tasks toolbar button or simple type in a task which is recognized as "- [ ]"',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-tasklists-in-your-pbis/task-checklist.jpg"
/>

This will show a visual que as to how many tasks you've completed for the PBI.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "okExample",
    figure: 'OK example - Using tasks we can easily see which are completed',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-tasklists-in-your-pbis/task-checklist-view.jpg"
/>

These tasks are numbered, but if we were to re-order them we'd need to re-number them so the list makes sense again. A better approach to numbering tasks would be to convert a task into it's own issue, this allows you to detail it out further or have more in-depth conversations around the issue specifically.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: 'Good example - Create issues from tasks to get an immutable reference',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-tasklists-in-your-pbis/task-checklist-view-good.jpg"
/>

One of the downsides to using checklists is that any checkbox in the issue description would show up as a task. This means that if you had a checkbox in the description that wasn't a task, it would show up as a task. This is why we recommend using tasklists.

  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'When you have more checkboxes, e.g. for bug reports. Your task indicator will not be accurate',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-tasklists-in-your-pbis/task-checklist-incorrect-tasks.jpg"
/>

### Using tasklists (recommended)

Lastly you should use the tasklist for your tasks, this gives the same advantages as standard checklists without interference from other checkboxes.


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'Using tasklist requires a little extra markdown around your checkboxes',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-tasklists-in-your-pbis/tasklists-markdown.jpg"
/>

Besides the benefits described above, there's also the advantage of having a UI component built specifically to markup a tasklist.


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'Using tasklist requires a little extra markdown around your checkboxes',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/use-tasklists-in-your-pbis/tasklists-ui.jpg"
/>

You can see from the UI component there is a convenient button to add a task, easily see who is assigned to tasks; As well as a menu list of options to convert to issue, rename and remove tasks, all through the UI. This is great for team members who don't feel comfortable with markdown.
