Although many have differing opinions on this matter, Windows applications have standard storage locations for their files, whether they're settings or user data. Some will disagree with those standards, but it's safe to say that following it regardless will give users a more consistent and straightforward computing experience.

### Further Information

- The System.Environment class provides the most general way of retrieving those paths
- The Application class lives in the System.Windows.Form namespace, which indicates it should only be used for WinForm applications. Other types of applications such as Console and WebForm applications use their corresponding utility classes
