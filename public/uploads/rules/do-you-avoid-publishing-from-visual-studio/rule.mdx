seoDescription: Avoid publishing from Visual Studio and instead use a defined Build
  in TFS for reliable and repeatable deployments.
title: Do you avoid publishing from Visual Studio?
type: rule
uri: do-you-avoid-publishing-from-visual-studio

Publishing from Visual Studio is a convenient way to deploy a web application, but it relies on a single developer’s machine which can lead to problems. Deploying to production should be easily repeatable, and able to be performed from different machines.

<endIntro />

A better way to deploy is by using a defined Build in TFS.
