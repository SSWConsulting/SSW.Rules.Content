We all know the feeling after a long day... Exhausted, we wander the internet, lazily looking for content to consume easily. For many, this normally takes the form of watching videos after trailing through their Reddit, Twitter, & other social media platforms. Therefore, it is important to make sure that your blog post title and content stand out to this demographic.

/>
One simple way to do this is to **prefix your blog post title** with "VIDEO – ".

Also, make sure your embedded **video is at the top of the post**, so users will see right away that there is a video on the post to be watched.

**Note:** **Do not make posts with an embedded video only.** It’s important to add text to give readers context. Include in writing what is your video about in at least a few sentences.
