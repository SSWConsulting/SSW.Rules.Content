seoDescription: When writing tests to confirm bugfixes, it's essential to reference the issue ID in the test name and comments. This provides context for future developers, helping them understand why a particular test exists.

Some bugs have a whole history related to them and, when we fix them, we don't want to lose the rationale for the test. By adding a comment to the test that references the bug ID, future developers can see why a test is testing a particular behaviour.

```cs
[Test]
public void TestProj11()
{
}
```

::: bad
Figure: Bad example - The test name is the bug ID and it's unclear what it is meant to test

:::

```cs
///
 Test case where a user can cause an application exception on the
 Seminars webpage
 1. User enters a title for the seminar
 2. Saves the item
 3. Presses the back button
 4. Chooses to resave the item
 See: https://server/jira/browse/PROJ-11
 ///
[Test]
public void TestResavingAfterPressingBackShouldntBreak()
{
}
```

::: good
Figure: Good example - The test name is clearer, good comments for the unit test give a little context, and there is a link to the original bug report
