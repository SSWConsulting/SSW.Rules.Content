Meetings are an area some clients think will be free, so always mention it.

<endOfIntro />

As stated in SSW's [Terms and Conditions](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Forms/ConsultingOrderTermsConditions.aspx):

In an hourly work agreement, the initial meeting with the customer will be conducted by SSW at no cost. Subsequent meetings are considered as specification time and will be charged at the agreed rate. The minimum time chargeable for on-site work is 2 (two) hours per person per visit. The minimum time chargeable for off-site work is 15 (fifteen) minutes per person per request.

In some occasions it may be necessary to compromise by charging for the developer's time but not the project manager's.
