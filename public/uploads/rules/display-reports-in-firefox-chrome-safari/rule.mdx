SQL Reporting Services works great with Internet Explorer but other browsers sometimes don’t work correctly, Here’s the solution.

:::

This issue is caused by Reporting Services emitting Quirks Mode HTML, to fix this make the following changes to the ReportingServices.js file the full path to this file is:

::: greybox
C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSRS10_50.MSSQLSERVER\Reporting Services\ReportManager\js\ReportingServices.js
:::

Add the following java script:

```sql
function pageLoad() {    
var element = document.getElementById("ctl31_ctl10");
if (element) 
{
       element.style.overflow = "visible"; 
} }
```

Once this change is made reports will be visible.

::: good
