SQL Reporting Services works great with Internet Explorer but other browsers sometimes don’t work correctly, Here’s the solution.

<endIntro />

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure="Bad example - SQL RS does not work in Chrome by default"
  src="/uploads/rules/display-reports-in-firefox-chrome-safari/report-display-bad_1726800492478.jpg"
/>


This issue is caused by Reporting Services emitting Quirks Mode HTML, to fix this make the following changes to the ReportingServices.js file the full path to this file is:


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSRS10_50.MSSQLSERVER\Reporting Services\ReportManager\js\ReportingServices.js
  </>}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure=""
/>


Add the following java script:

```sql
function pageLoad() {
var element = document.getElementById("ctl31_ctl10");
if (element)
{
       element.style.overflow = "visible";
} }
```

Once this change is made reports will be visible.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Good example - SQL RS fixed to correctly display in Chrome"
  src="/uploads/rules/display-reports-in-firefox-chrome-safari/report-display-good_1726800492478.jpg"
/>
