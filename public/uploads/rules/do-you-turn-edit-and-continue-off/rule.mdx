With VS2013, you get the long awaited 64 bit edit and continue, and it is turned on by default. Edit and Continue is great when you need to make a quick change to executing code. However, it has its downsides too:

- Web Development - Kills IISExpress when you stop
- Can lead to bad development practices (trying to debug instead of doing RED, GREEN, REFACTOR)
  </>}
/>
This is why we recommend that it is turned OFF by default.
