When AI assistants make code changes on your behalf, proper attribution is essential. Modern AI coding agents like Claude Code and OpenCode **automatically add themselves as co-authors** when they create commits.

However, you should still add yourself as a co-author to indicate that you reviewed and approved the AI's work.

## Automatic Attribution in Modern AI Agents

| Tool               | Default Behavior      | Notes                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Claude Code**    | ✅ Auto (configurable) | Adds `Co-Authored-By: Claude <model> <noreply@anthropic.com>` - [see settings](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings#attribution-settings) |
| **OpenCode**       | ✅ Auto                | Adds model as co-author                                                                                                                       |
| **GitHub Copilot** | ❌ Manual setup        | [See setup below](#setup-for-github-copilot)                                                                                                  |
| **Cursor**         | ❌ Manual setup        | [See setup below](#setup-for-github-copilot)                                                                                                  |

## Commits That Tell a Story

When working with AI agents on larger tasks, ask them to create commits in a logical order that "tells a story" of the implementation. This makes code reviews easier and helps future developers understand the evolution of a feature.

<boxEmbed
  style="info"
  body={<>
    **Prompt tip:** When asking an AI agent to implement a feature with multiple components, include:
    
    *"Please commit changes in a logical order that tells a story - for example, data models first, then business logic, then UI components, and finally tests."*
  </>}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure=""
/>

**Example story-driven commit sequence:**

1. `feat: Add User database model and migrations` - Foundation first
2. `feat: Implement user authentication service` - Core logic
3. `feat: Add login and registration API endpoints` - Interface layer
4. `feat: Create login form component` - UI implementation
5. `test: Add authentication unit and integration tests` - Verification

## Co-Author Format

The standard Git co-author format:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: Add recipe search functionality

Co-authored-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>"
```

To find your details, run: `git config user.name` and `git config user.email`

## When to Add Yourself as Co-Author

**✅ DO** add yourself when:

* AI implements features, fixes bugs, refactors code, or writes tests
* You actively collaborate with AI on a solution

**❌ DON'T** add yourself for:

* Automated dependency updates or bot-generated changes

## Setup for GitHub Copilot

For tools that don't auto-attribute, add the following to your AI assistant configuration (e.g., `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.cursorrules`, or [AGENTS.md](/write-agents-md)):

## Git Commit Guidelines

### Commit Frequently
Commit changes incrementally as you complete logical units of work:
- After adding a new feature or component
- After fixing a bug
- After refactoring code
- Before making major changes (safety checkpoint)

### Co-Author Attribution
**ALWAYS add the user as a co-author on commits** to ensure proper attribution.

**How to identify the user:**
1. Check `git config user.name` and `git config user.email`
2. If in GitHub Codespaces, use the logged-in GitHub user

**Format:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat: Brief description

Co-authored-by: User Name <user.email@example.com>"
````

````

### Alternative: Git Hook

Create a `prepare-commit-msg` hook to automatically add yourself as co-author:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg

COMMIT_MSG_FILE=$1
COMMIT_SOURCE=$2

if [ -z "$COMMIT_SOURCE" ]; then
  COAUTHOR_NAME=$(git config user.name)
  COAUTHOR_EMAIL=$(git config user.email)

  if ! grep -q "Co-authored-by: $COAUTHOR_NAME" "$COMMIT_MSG_FILE"; then
    echo "" >> "$COMMIT_MSG_FILE"
    echo "Co-authored-by: $COAUTHOR_NAME <$COAUTHOR_EMAIL>" >> "$COMMIT_MSG_FILE"
  fi
fi
````
