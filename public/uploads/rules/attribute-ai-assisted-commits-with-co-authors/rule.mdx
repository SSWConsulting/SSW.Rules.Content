When AI assistants make code changes on your behalf, proper attribution is essential. Modern AI coding agents like Claude Code and OpenCode now **automatically add themselves as co-authors** when they create commits - you don't need to configure anything.

However, you should still add yourself as a co-author to indicate that you reviewed and approved the AI's work.

## Automatic Attribution in Modern AI Agents

| Tool | Default Behavior | Co-Author Format |
|------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Claude Code** | ✅ Auto-adds co-author | `Co-Authored-By: Claude <model> <noreply@anthropic.com>` |
| **OpenCode** | ✅ Auto-adds attribution | Adds model as co-author |
| **GitHub Copilot** | ❌ No auto-attribution | Requires manual setup |
| **Cursor** | ❌ No auto-attribution | Requires manual setup |

## Commits That Tell a Story

When working with AI agents on larger tasks, ask them to create commits in a logical order that "tells a story" of the implementation. This makes code reviews easier and helps future developers understand the evolution of a feature.

    **Prompt tip:** When asking an AI agent to implement a feature with multiple components, include:

    *"Please commit changes in a logical order that tells a story - for example, data models first, then business logic, then UI components, and finally tests."*
  </>}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure=""
/>


**Example story-driven commit sequence:**

1. `feat: Add User database model and migrations` - Foundation first
2. `feat: Implement user authentication service` - Core logic
3. `feat: Add login and registration API endpoints` - Interface layer
4. `feat: Create login form component` - UI implementation
5. `test: Add authentication unit and integration tests` - Verification

## Co-Author Format

The standard Git co-author format:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: Add recipe search functionality

Co-authored-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>"
```

To find your details, run: `git config user.name` and `git config user.email`

## When to Add Yourself as Co-Author

**✅ DO** add yourself when:
* AI implements features, fixes bugs, refactors code, or writes tests
* You actively collaborate with AI on a solution

**❌ DON'T** add yourself for:
* Automated dependency updates or bot-generated changes
