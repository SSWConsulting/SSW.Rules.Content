If possible you should always use hyperlinks to open new pages on your site instead of using JavaScript.

There are two good reasons for avoiding JavaScript-powered links:

1. Copying and pasting sections of the site to an email or a document will maintain the clickable links
2. There's an (ever-decreasing) chance a user won't have JavaScript enabled and won't be able to click the link

```html
<div onclick="window.open('mynewpage.html');">Open a new page</div>
```

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: 'Figure: Bad Example - This link can\'t be clicked on if you paste it into an email or if JavaScript is off',
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


```html
<a href="mynewpage.html">Open a new page</a>
```

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: 'Figure: Good Example - This link can still be clicked on when pasted and when JavaScript is turned off',
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />
