A common problem on projects is seeing “outdated” Figma designs and assuming they need to be re-implemented when in fact, the design has been implemented, just with some conscious adjustments by the developer or client.

This creates unnecessary rework and confusion. Designers chase devs, devs get frustrated, and features get implemented twice when they didn’t need to.

## Use "✅ Done" to confirm the design was implemented – even if changed

Once a developer implements a design (such as a full page or component), the designer should check the implementation and, if it's been actioned (even with valid changes), leave a “✅ Done” comment in Figma.

This doesn’t just mean “pixel perfect match”. It means the intent of the design has been realized, and the deviation (if any) is acceptable.

## Why this matters

Designs often change during development due to client feedback, technical constraints, global styles, or accessibility and performance needs. If these changes are not reflected in Figma, designs can appear out of date and cause unnecessary rework.

Using “✅ Done” (with optional context) confirms the design has been implemented, even if adjusted. This keeps Figma trustworthy and makes it clear what is live.ffer.

## Avoid duplicate work

Without a clear status:

* Designers rework already implemented designs
* PMs and QAs flag intentional differences as bugs
* Developers are asked to fix things that were changed on purpose

Marking “✅ Done” shows:

* The design is implemented
* Changes are intentional and known
* No rework is needed unless requirements change

## Summary

Use “✅ Done” in Figma to confirm implementation, even if there are small changes.

This prevents confusion, avoids duplicate work, and keeps designs accurate.
