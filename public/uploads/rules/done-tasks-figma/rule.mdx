A common problem on projects is seeing “outdated” Figma designs and assuming they need to be re-implemented when in fact, the design has been implemented, just with some conscious adjustments by the developer or client.

This creates unnecessary rework and confusion. Designers chase devs, devs get frustrated, and features get implemented twice when they didn’t need to.

<endIntro />

## Use "✅ Done" to confirm the design was implemented – even if changed

Once a developer implements a design (such as a full page or component), the designer should check the implementation and, if it's been actioned (even with valid changes), leave a “✅ Done” comment in Figma.

This doesn’t just mean “pixel perfect match”. It means the intent of the design has been realized, and the deviation (if any) is acceptable.

<imageEmbed alt="Image" size="medium" showBorder={false} figurePrefix="good" figure="A &#x22;TODO&#x22; comment followed up by a &#x22;✅ Done&#x22; comment to track implementation" src="/uploads/rules/done-tasks-figma/figma_tasks_good_example.png" />

## Why this matters

Designs evolve during development. Sometimes:

\- A client requests a change during a call

\- A component needs to be adjusted for technical reasons

\- A global styling rule affects layout

\- A11y or performance concerns cause deviation

If these changes happen and aren’t recorded in Figma, the design appears out of sync, and the designer might redo work unnecessarily.

By confirming the status in Figma with ✅ Done and optionally noting the rationale, the file stays trustworthy. Everyone knows what’s live and why it may differ.

## Don't create duplicate work – keep the status visible

Without this habit:

\- Designers re-spec changes that have already been implemented

\- PMs or QAs question mismatches and raise bugs

\- Devs get frustrated being asked to "fix" things they intentionally changed

By showing ✅ Done in the comment thread, you signal:

\- “This design was implemented”

\- “We know about the change”

\- “No need to re-implement unless there's a new reason”

Summary

Use ✅ Done in Figma to show a design has been implemented, even if it changed slightly during development.

This avoids confusion, stops designers from asking for unnecessary rework, and keeps the design file accurate and trustworthy.
