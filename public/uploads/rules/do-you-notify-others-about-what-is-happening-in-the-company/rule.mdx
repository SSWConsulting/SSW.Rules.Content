When something happens in your company, always send around an email so that the whole team is kept in the loop.

<endIntro />

Examples of events that you should send an email around for:

- An update to a company standard or procedure (including a link to it)
- Births and marriages
- Employees who are starting or finishing
- Anything significant that is happening in your life

You should really feel free to share any good news you have with everyone. It will make the office feel more like a family and not just a place to turn up to work.

    Hi Guys,

I'm heading to Sanya with my wife and kid this weekend. I still remember the good time I had there last year at the MVP China Summit; also I think I need to recharge myself a little bit after long time working over 12 hours almost every day.

Pretty excited right now as this will be the very 1st official trip that I take with my kid. I hope he likes the beach.

Be prepared for more photos from my Nikon D80, I think it will be having a hard time during these 5 days.

Will be back next Thursday, so if you need me for anything, call my mobile XXX (if you are in Sydney), or YYY (if you are in Beijing)
