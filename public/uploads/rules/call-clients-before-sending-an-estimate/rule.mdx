When you're competing for someone's business, what could be worse than losing the work simply because the client either didn't receive your email, or was too busy to read it?

If you have an existing client, who is already impressed with your work, you don't need to go to the trouble of meeting then to show them an estimate. However, you should at least call them. This way, they know you are about to send them something so will look out for it.

Always call the client **before** you send an estimate, then send the email with "[As per our conversation](/as-per-our-conversation-emails)".

"Hi Mr.Northwind,

As per our conversation today, here is a ballpark schedule for the work we talked about. As you can see all the items are listed separately so you can identify how the estimate is put together. I'm very happy to discuss these estimates with you so feel free to give me a call."
