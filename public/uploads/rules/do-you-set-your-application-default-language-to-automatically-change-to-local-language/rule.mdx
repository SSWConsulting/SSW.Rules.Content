If you are localizing your web application to make it available in a varitety of languages, it's better to set your application default language to automatically change to local language. E.g. Make the web application default language as same as the browser language.

In order to use your web application in your preferred language, simply set that language in your browser, save/apply the new settings and then launch the application.
