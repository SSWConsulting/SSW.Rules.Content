Have you ever stumbled upon a useful chart, diagram, or infographic with embedded text, only to find that the text can't be copied? This is incredibly frustrating because the information is locked in an image format. The process of manually typing out the text can be time-consuming and prone to errors. There are a couple ways to solve this:

### Method 1: Using OneNote

Using OneNote is simple. All you do is paste your image into OneNote, right click on it, and click **Copy Text from Picture**.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={true}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure="Paste image into OneNote and right click on it"
  src="/uploads/rules/copy-text-from-image/one-note-1.png"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="The text pastes below the image. Easy!"
  src="/uploads/rules/copy-text-from-image/one-note-2.png"
/>


### Method 2: Using Google Drive

In Google Drive you need to upload your image as a new file. Then you need to right click on the image file and select ** Open with | Google Docs**.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={true}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure="Upload your image first"
  src="/uploads/rules/copy-text-from-image/drive-1.png"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={true}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure="Open your image with Google Docs"
  src="/uploads/rules/copy-text-from-image/drive-2.png"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="The text is added to the new document!"
  src="/uploads/rules/copy-text-from-image/drive-3.png"
/>
