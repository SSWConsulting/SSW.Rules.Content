  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Paste image into OneNote and right click on it",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/copy-text-from-image/one-note-1.png"
/>
<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good example - The text pastes below the image. Easy!",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/copy-text-from-image/one-note-2.png"
/>

  showBorder={true}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Upload your image first",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/copy-text-from-image/drive-1.png"

  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/copy-text-from-image/drive-2.png"
