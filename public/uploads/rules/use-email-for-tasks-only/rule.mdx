Email is a very powerful business tool. The main problem is that for most people it is out of control - emails build up until they are impossible to manage.

To help minimize mailbox clutter, try these tips:

<endIntro />

## Sending emails

It is better when email is not used as your first choice for communication. Of course, if the person is unavailable to call, you may have to.

* Never send emails for chatting
* Send emails that contain [clear numbered tasks or questions](/number-tasks-questions), not banter

## Receiving emails

Too many people reply by email asking for more information, which wastes time and does not guarantee a response.

* If an email you receive is not clear, phone the sender and [ask for clarification](/seek-clarification-via-phone), then document it in a follow-up email “[As per our conversation...](/as-per-our-conversation-emails)”
* If you can't get through,  [chase your Product Owner before he has to chase you](/chase-the-product-owner-for-clarification)
* If you are attempting to contact this person out of business hours, consider waiting until the next day, or starting your email by mentioning **why** you are not following this rule. E.g. Add at the top of your email:\
  *"I am not calling you right now as it is out of business hours..."*
