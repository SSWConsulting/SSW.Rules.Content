seoDescription: Prevent white screen reloads by using jQuery or Ajax controls to send
  requests without feedback.
title: Do you avoid letting the screen go white?
type: rule
uri: do-you-avoid-letting-the-screen-go-white
---

Use jQuery or Ajax controls whenever possible to send requests without feedback on the process. This is to avoid a "white" blank page, while the page reloads. Similar ideas are like a save button that disables after the first click so it can't be hit multiple times.
