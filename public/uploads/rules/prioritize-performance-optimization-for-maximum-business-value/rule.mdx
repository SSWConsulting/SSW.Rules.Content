title: Do you prioritize performance optimization for maximum business value?
type: rule

Like any development, performance optimization requires development time and should therefore be prioritized for business value.

Include the following considerations:

* What is the preferred performance for this feature?
* What represents an acceptable performance metric?
* How many users are expected to use this feature within a timeframe?
* What is the business impact of poor performance for this feature?
* Are we planning to significantly change this feature in the near future?

    Hi Adam,

As per our conversation, we have identified 2 slow queries:

Query 1: On the “Edit Item” screen (admin only) we have identified 4 separate SQL queries that can be rewritten as one. We estimate that this will reduce the response time by 1.5 seconds. Only a few admin users will be affected
Query 2: On the Home page is a query that currently takes 1 second that we can reduce to ½ a second. This affects all users.

We optimized the "Edit Item" page because that had the biggest measurable improvement.

    Hi Adam,

As per our conversation, we have identified a query in the "Save Timesheet" endpoint that often takes more than 2 seconds to complete – well beyond the project’s 800ms target.
However, this entire feature is scheduled to be migrated from MVC to Angular in the next Sprint.

Recommended actions:

* We won't optimize the existing implementation
* Raise the priority of the Angular migration PBI
* Ensure that performance metrics are included in the acceptance criteria of the migration PBI

1. Please “reply all” with changes or your acceptance.
