seoDescription: Consistently labeling form buttons helps users navigate applications
  smoothly and reduces confusion.
title: Do you label your form buttons consistently?

If buttons with similar functionality are named inconsistently across an app, it can cause a confusing experience for users. For example, the buttons used to close a form should be named consistently across your app.

Additionally, buttons should have clear names so the user knows what to expect. For example, it is unclear if a button named "close" will save (or not save) when closing, so "cancel" would be clearer.

* **Save** button could possibly update the fields but keep the form open.
* **Close** could save the fields, then close the form, when the
  **Cancel** button may be more appropriate.

We recommend the age-old standards of:

* **OK** . Close the form and save any changed data. This should be referenced by the form's AcceptButton property.
* **Cancel** . Close the form without saving. This should be referenced by the form's CancelButton property.
* **Apply** . Save data without closing the form.
