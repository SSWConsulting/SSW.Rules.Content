  avoid degrading its perceived value and to match user intent.

The quality of your images is a subconscious message to your audience.

Using high-quality images on a website is essential for creating a visually appealing and engaging user experience. High-resolution images enhance the site’s aesthetics, build credibility, and improve user engagement. If you use low quality pictures, then you unintentionally suggest the same message about your product.

However, it's important to balance image quality with performance, ensuring fast loading times without sacrificing clarity.

For this reason, we encourage you to choose only high quality photos and to avoid unprofessional cartoons and clip-arts.

Every time you add an image to your content, make sure it:

* Is readable if it has any text on it
* Has been [optimized](/optimize-your-images)
* Looks consistent with others on the same page
* Has at least 800px width (except for logos, icons, and profile images)
* (optional) Is not in dark-mode - Light background images look better most of the times

    **Warning:** Never stretch small, low-resolution photos to make it fill up the space. This degrades the resolution and the image will appear very coarse and granular on the projection screen.
