It is important that users of your application who provide feedback have very clear indications of work that is not yet complete, to avoid feedback on sections of your application that are still under development.
Also, see our [rule on colour usage in Windows Forms](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/rules/rulestobetterwindowsforms.aspx#RedYellowDesigner).

[See FeatureToggle by Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html). Feature Toggling can require a large amount of extra work and so is often only implemented by teams with a need to ship features while others are still in development
