In C# the "var" keyword can be used instead of providing an explicit type when declaring a variable. The type is then inferred from the initial assignment of the variable.

<endIntro />

It is just a short hand to save developers from typing out the type of a variable.

```
List<string> items = new List<string>();
```
**❌ Figure: Bad example - You should just use "var" instead of "List\<string>"**  

```
var item = new List<string>();
```
**✅ Figure: Good example - Using "var" to save a few keystrokes and reduce repetition**  

This can be kept consistent by creating an [editorconfig file](/consistent-code-style) which can then generate compile time warnings.

An [example editor config](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.CleanArchitecture/blob/main/.editorconfig), look for the **var preferences**.
