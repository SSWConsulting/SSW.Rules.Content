You'll need to justify why you chose one option over another with a solid figure. As there are a myriad of ways in which you can market your products/services, there's a managerial expectation that **you'll be able to reflect on its performance**.

For example, if you're coordinating a social media campaign, you need to make sure that all of the engagements and conversions are tracked, so you can analyze the data [once a month](/analyse-your-results-once-a-month) and when the campaign is finished.
