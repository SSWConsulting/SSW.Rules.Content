seoDescription: Optimize database performance by setting indexes and constraints to
  a fillfactor of 90% for efficient inserts.
title: Schema - Do you use FillFactor of 90% for indexes and constraints?

Indexes should generally have a fillfactor of 90%. If the amount of data stored in the database does not prohibit rebuilding indexes, a fillfactor of 90% should be maintained to increase the performance of inserts.

<endIntro />

A table that expects a lot of insert operations could use a lower fillfactor.
