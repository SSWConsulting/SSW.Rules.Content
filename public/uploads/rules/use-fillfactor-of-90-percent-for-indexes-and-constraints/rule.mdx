<introEmbed
  body={<>
Indexes should generally have a fillfactor of 90%. If the amount of data stored in the database does not prohibit rebuilding indexes, a fillfactor of 90% should be maintained to increase the performance of inserts.

/>
A table that expects a lot of insert operations could use a lower fillfactor.
