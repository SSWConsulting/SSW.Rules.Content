It is often that developers find themselves using the incorrect/inefficient anchor names.
  </>}
/>
According to [W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/links.html), anchor names must observe the following rules:

* Anchor names **must be unique** within a document
* **Begin with a letter** (A-Z, a-z) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits (0-9), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods (".")
* **Don't add spacings** - When you are defining an anchor name, make sure there are no spaces within the name
* Anchor name **cannot start with `#`**

These are the things you should consider when creating an anchor link:

* **Make it meaningful** - When you are sending the URL by email it helps indicate what you are talking about
* **Avoid list numbers** - They often change. An anchor like `#13` becomes incorrect when the order changes
* **Know they are case sensitive** - `#usergroups` is **not** the same as `#UserGroups`. Always check your links and anchor names are identical, matching the capitalization
