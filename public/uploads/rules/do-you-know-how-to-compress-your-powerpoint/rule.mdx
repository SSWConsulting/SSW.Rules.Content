Unfortunately, when you “Send As Email” it doesn’t compress the file; this is how to compress a PowerPoint for emailing.

### Remove the video from the master slide.

This has been done in the 3.8 release of the template, but for old templates you may have to do this manually.

  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Go to the slide master",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-how-to-compress-your-powerpoint/01.png"
/>



<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Find the slide layout \"Presentation with Title and Video\" and delete it",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-how-to-compress-your-powerpoint/02.png"
/>


### Compress ALL your images


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Go to the File menu",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-how-to-compress-your-powerpoint/05.png"
/>



<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Select Options",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-how-to-compress-your-powerpoint/06.png"
/>



<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Apply settings. You may compress this further down to 96ppi if you must",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-how-to-compress-your-powerpoint/07.png"
/>


### Compress individual images (not recommended)


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Find the Image Compression option",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-how-to-compress-your-powerpoint/03.png"
/>



<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Apply these settings and go for a coffee break. This may take a long time, depending on how many slides you have",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-how-to-compress-your-powerpoint/04.png"
/>


### Compress font - ONLY DO THIS WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED EDITING


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Apply these settings. Once you remove the font, you’re more likely to get missing font bugs when editing the file, so only do this step when you are done",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-how-to-compress-your-powerpoint/08.png"
/>


### Save as "YourFileName_compressed.pptx."

Do not override your original. You should always keep a high-res master of any media document.

If you find your files are still rather big after compression, you can export the PowerPoint to determine which particular slide is taking up all that space. http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/find-which-slide-in-your-powerpoint-presentation-is-the-largest-in-size/

### The result

Your own mileage may vary.
