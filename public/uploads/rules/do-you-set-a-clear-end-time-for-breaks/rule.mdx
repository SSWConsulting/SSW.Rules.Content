When you set a break at a training course, you should make sure you first finish what you are doing. Donâ€™t cut people off because of a clock.

Tell them 20 min break (or 1 hour for lunch) and:

- Let them break
- Write in a clear place the end time for the break and ask people to be back on time

- If anyone comes back late, **explain the value of integrity** . Honoring your word in small things makes it easier to honor it for larger things, such as doing your best in a Sprint, and makes people believe in you more
