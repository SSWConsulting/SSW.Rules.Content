If you are providing food and drinks for the attendees, this needs to be organized and confirmed.

Use the following checklist to ensure you get catering right.

* Dietary requirements – Are there any specific requirements, such as vegetarian, gluten-free, kosher, halal etc.? Are they visually labelled to avoid confusion for your event attendees?
* Is there adequate access to get the food and catering staff into the venue?
* Is there a designated area where food is served?
* Is the venue allowed to provide food for attendees?

**Tip:** You can make your event look like a million dollars by taking a little extra time and decanting your yummy offerings into nicer containers.
