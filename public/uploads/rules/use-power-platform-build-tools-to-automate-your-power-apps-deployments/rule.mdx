You’ve built your Power App using all the best practices, have multiple solutions that are split into a logical component, you’re using environment variables to handle your configuration data everything is going great! Now it comes time to deploy these changes to the Test environment. Do not deploy these manually. It is a repetitive step and if you have multiple solutions, there will be installation order dependencies that need to be handled, etc. Then the whole process will need to be repeated when you promote the changes to production, rinse, and repeat for the next round of changes for test and production. Highly repetitive, error-prone, and a prime example of automation.
