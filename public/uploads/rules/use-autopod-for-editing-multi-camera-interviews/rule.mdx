Editing multi-camera interviews using traditional methods can be a painstakingly slow and labor-intensive process. Editors often spend hours syncing and cutting footage from different camera angles, which can lead to inefficiencies and delayed project delivery.

## Why use Autopod?

Autopod offers a robust solution for streamlining the editing of multi-camera interviews. By automating much of the synchronization and cutting process, it allows editors to focus on refining the content rather than getting bogged down in technical details.

## Benefits of Autopod

* **Time-Saving:** Autopod significantly reduces the time required to edit multi-camera interviews by automatically syncing and cutting between different angles
* **Efficiency:** The automation of repetitive tasks allows editors to concentrate on creative aspects, improving the overall quality of the final product
* **Consistency:** Autopod ensures a consistent editing style throughout the project, maintaining professional standards across all interviews

## How to implement Autopod in your workflow

### Step-by-step guide

1. **[Install AutoPod](https://www.autopod.fm):** Download, install and subscribe to AutoPod
2. **Import footage:** Begin by importing all camera angles and audio tracks into your editing software
3. **Sync footage:** Use Autopod to automatically sync the different camera angles based on audio waveforms. Each video angle needs separate audio track to sync and make cuts properly
4. **Initial cuts:** Allow Autopod to make initial cuts, switching between angles based on speaker activity and other predefined rules
5. **Review and refine:** Review the automated edits and make any necessary adjustments to ensure the flow and pacing meet your standards
6. **Export:** Once satisfied with the edits, export the final video for delivery
