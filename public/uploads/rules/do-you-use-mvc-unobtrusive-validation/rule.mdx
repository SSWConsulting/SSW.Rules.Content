seoDescription: Do you use MVC Unobtrusive Validation to configure both client-side
  and server-side validation for data integrity and fast user feedback?

Validation is an important part of any data-driven web application. Client-Side validation provides fast user feedback and a better UI experience but cannot be relied on for data integrity - so client-side validation should always be backed by additional server-side validation.

With MVC Unobtrusive Validation, you can configure both client-side and server-side in one place.

<endOfIntro />

Validation rules can be added to a model object via Data Annotations or using the Fluent Validation API.

Fluent Validation is [available as a Nuget package](http://www.nuget.org/packages/FluentValidation/). See [Do you use Fluent Validation?](/use-fluent-validation)

If you create a new MVC web application in VisualStudio 2013, unobtrusive validation will be enabled by default. Otherwise, it's simple to [install from Nuget](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.jQuery.Unobtrusive.Validation/). To use it simply:

1. Bind your razor views to model objects
2. Use Html Helpers to render the form UI

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePreset="goodExample"
  figureText={"Good Example - this razor view binds to a strongly typed model object and uses HTML helpers."}
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-use-mvc-unobtrusive-validation/view.png"
/>



<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePreset="default"
  figureText={"the HTML UI rendered for this view now has data-validation attributes that are followed by JQuery validation to provide rich client-side validation."}
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-use-mvc-unobtrusive-validation/Html.png"
/>



<imageEmbed

  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePreset="default"
  figureText={"On the server-side, the same validation rules will be checked when you call ModelState.IsValid"}
