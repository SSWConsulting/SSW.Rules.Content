<introEmbed
  body={<>
In Sitefinity you can alter the appearance and content areas on your webpage using "Layouts". These layouts are basically just Divs with sizes applied.
  </>}
/>

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "You have the ability to assign a Class to a Div only. No other customisations can be made",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-tell-your-designers-to-only-use-classes/sitefinity-class-only.jpg"
/>


Additionally, Sitefinity will hard code the widths of the layout and there is no way to stop it.
The hack work around is to manually remove the widths via JQuery:


<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    
$(".sf_colsOut").css("width", "");

  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>
