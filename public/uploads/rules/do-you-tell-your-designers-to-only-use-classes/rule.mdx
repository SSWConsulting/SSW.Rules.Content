In Sitefinity you can alter the appearance and content areas on your webpage using "Layouts". These layouts are basically just Divs with sizes applied.

<endOfIntro />


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  captionStyle="default"
  captionText={"You have the ability to assign a Class to a Div only. No other customisations can be made"}
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-tell-your-designers-to-only-use-classes/sitefinity-class-only.jpg"
/>


Additionally, Sitefinity will hard code the widths of the layout and there is no way to stop it.
The hack work around is to manually remove the widths via JQuery:


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    
$(".sf_colsOut").css("width", "");

  </>}
  captionStyle="default"
  captionText={""}
/>
