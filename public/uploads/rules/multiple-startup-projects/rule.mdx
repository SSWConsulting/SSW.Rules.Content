It's common for .NET solutions to have multiple projects, for example an API and a UI.
Did you know Microsoft Visual Studio and Jetbrains Rider allow you to start as many projects as you want with a single click?

### ❌ Split Terminals

You can run each project in a seperate terminal using `dotnet run`, but this will quickly become hard to manage the more projects you need to run.

### ❌ Manually Launching in IDE

You could also manually select and launch each project in your IDE, but this will result in a lot of clicking and waiting.
It can also be error prone as you may forget to launch a project.
