GitHub issues (classic) offers a great way to have an agile development process following a kanban process. Unfortunately it requires a bit of effort (or a 3rd party tool) to set it up for good Scrum.

<endIntro />

**Note:** Based on [GitHub Scrum workflow](https://github.com/jvandemo/github-scrum-workflow).

### How it works

- Product Backlog Items (PBIs) are reported as **issues**
- Points and metadata are assigned to PBIs as **labels**
- **milestones** are used to group issues in Sprints

### 1. Create issues as Product Backlog Items

To create a new backlog item, it is best practice to configure GitHub issue templates for your repository. See [Configuring issue templates for your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository)

Make sure you assign suitable labels to the issue. Later on during the [Sprint Forecast meeting](/sprint-forecast), the issue should be prioritized and added to a Sprint (milestone) if appropriate.

Issues allow you to have a conversation about the item and even allow you to create task lists inside the issue using [GitHub's markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### 2. Add labels to issues

Add the following labels to your repository:

#### Estimates

**estimate** labels allow you to set estimates in your backlog. E.g.:

| Label          | Time Estimate |
| -------------- | :-----------: |
| `estimate: 1`  |    2 hour     |
| `estimate: 2`  |    4 hours    |
| `estimate: 4`  |     1 day     |
| `estimate: 8`  |    2 days     |
| `estimate: 16` |    4 days     |
| `estimate: 32` |    2 weeks    |
| `estimate: 64` |    1 month    |

Your actual estimates should align with the rule [Estimating - Do you know how to size Product Backlog Items (PBIs) effectively?](/estimating-do-you-know-how-to-size-user-stories-effectively)

#### Types

**type** labels allow you to easily filter PBIs in the dashboard. E.g.:

| Label                 | Type                    |
| --------------------- | :---------------------- |
| `type:bug`            | bug                     |
| `type:chore`          | chore, maintenance work |
| `type:feature`        | new feature             |
| `type:infrastructure` | infrastructure related  |
| `type:performance`    | performance related     |
| `type:refactor`       | refactor                |
| `type:test`           | test related            |

#### Others

You can define and assign custom labels that you need within your workflow or organization.

### 3. Define Sprints as milestones

You can create a milestone for every Sprint and add Product PBIs from the backlog to a milestone.

This process allows you to group PBIs in Sprints and track them by milestone in your issue dashboard (github.com/issues when logged in).

The backlog then consists of all PBIs that have no `milestone` attached to them.

    **Tip:** Use `no:milestone` in the search field on your issue dashboard to find PBIs.
