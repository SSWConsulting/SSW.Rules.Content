While blogging during work hours should generally be avoided, there are occasions when it becomes necessary, such as when you discover a valuable solution to a problem. To ensure that your blog posts reach their full potential, you should dedicate time **after work hours** for review and refinement - gold plating.

Remember, while blogging during work hours may be a temporary compromise, the commitment to excellence after work hours ensures that your posts shine brightly.
