Promoting your application and business via social media can be extremely beneficial, not only for promoting a business but for feedback from customers as well. To help implement social media campaigns, try these tips:
  </>}

* Target platforms for the countries in which you’ll have either e-commerce or on-the-ground presence. e.g. Facebook/Rednote, Twitter/Weibo, TikTok/Douyin.
* Understand the specific social media websites and craft the message for each language. Always localize, don’t just translate. Google Translate just isn't good enough; always give it to a native speaker to translate (LLMs are getting much better, but still need a human to do the final check).
* Don't make the text longer than what the shortest supported is (usually Twitter which is 140 characters).
* Studies show that posts with an image get more traction.
* Post it to the English site.
* Then post it to the Chinese site.
* Great, now you are ready to post to all of the social media platforms simultaneously.
