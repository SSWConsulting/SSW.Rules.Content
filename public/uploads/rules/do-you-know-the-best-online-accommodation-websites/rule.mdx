Use a price comparison website to choose the hotel you'd like to book, but don't book directly through that site right away. Always call the hotel first to see if they can give you a better price. [This article explains how this can save you hundreds](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/roadwarriorvoices/2015/06/03/why-you-should-book-your-stay-directly-with-the-hotel/83307734).
  </>}
/>
The best price comparison websites for accommodation are:

* [lastminute.com.au](http://www.lastminute.com.au)
* [stayz.com.au](http://www.stayz.com.au)

As with flights, book the accommodation details as a separate appointment in your calendar. If for the accommodation is for someone else, use the calendar for the person who is travelling.
