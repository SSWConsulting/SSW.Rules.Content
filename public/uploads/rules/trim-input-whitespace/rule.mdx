Mobile keyboards, autocomplete, and even copy-paste behavior often introduce leading or trailing whitespace into input fields. This causes validation to fail, even when the actual content is correct—like a GitHub URL ending in a space. That’s a frustrating experience for users, and it’s easily avoidable.
When input validation fails because of a whitespace character the user can’t see, it feels like the form is broken. Trimming whitespace is a simple fix that drastically improves UX.

## Always trim inputs before validating

For nearly all form fields (email addresses, URLs, usernames, etc.) it is best practice to automatically remove any leading and trailing whitespace **before** performing validation or submitting data.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: 'Bad example - Keyboard autocomplete added a trailing space, causing the GitHub URL validation to fail with an error message',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/trim-input-whitespace/bad-example-trailing-white-space-validation-failed.jpeg"
/>

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    
Code trims the input to remove whitespace:

```js
const trimmedValue = input.trim();
```

Input validation passes: “github.com/0xharkirat” is accepted
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: 'Good example – Automatically trimming input before validation makes the form behave as expected',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
/>

## Exceptions and notes

There are rare cases (e.g. password fields or intentionally space-padded inputs) where trimming might be inappropriate. In such cases, make this behavior explicit in the UI, or better yet, avoid such patterns altogether.

For most user inputs, trimming is safe, helpful, and expected.

### How to implement

Most platforms and frameworks make this easy:

* JavaScript/TypeScript: `value.trim()`
* C#: `input.Trim()`
* Python: `input.strip()`
* SQL: `TRIM(column)`
* HTML Input Events: Consider trimming on `onBlur` or `onChange` before submitting the form.

This small usability improvement makes a big difference - users don’t notice when it works, but they definitely notice when it doesn’t work.
