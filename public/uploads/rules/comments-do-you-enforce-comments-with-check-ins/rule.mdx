Team Foundation Server is great, and one of its neat features is enforcing comments when checking in code. Without comments, some of the other built in features like History become redundant without comments.

In Visual Studio 2013, to enforce this behaviour, you will need to:


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure="Go to Team Explorer | Source Control"
  src="/uploads/rules/comments-do-you-enforce-comments-with-check-ins/15-07-2014 10-41-30 AM.png"
/>



<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure="Then Check-in Policy | Add"
  src="/uploads/rules/comments-do-you-enforce-comments-with-check-ins/15-07-2014 10-42-21 AM.png"
/>



<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure="Then select Changeset Comments Policy and OK"
  src="/uploads/rules/comments-do-you-enforce-comments-with-check-ins/15-07-2014 10-42-43 AM.png"
/>



<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure="Now you have the Changeset Comments Policy applied to your Team Project"
  src="/uploads/rules/comments-do-you-enforce-comments-with-check-ins/15-07-2014 10-42-56 AM.png"
/>


Now the next time someone checks-in some code, they are forced to enter a comment.
