seoDescription: Avoid redundant linking (aka single link to a single location) by having only one link per page section that points to the same target. This helps users focus on the main text content and reduces confusion caused by multiple links leading to the same place.

Often a page has duplicated links pointing to the same page - all fairly close to each other, like in 1 or 2 paragraphs. It is a good idea to **avoid** having multiple links to the exact same page section, because they:

* Distract users from reading the main text content
* Confuse users as they have to decide which link to click first (and then end up to the same place anyway)
* Annoy users when they are repeatedly directed to the same page

    **Note:** The exception is when you find useful to users to have a second link in a different section of the page (e.g. 1 in the content, 1 in the "Related" section).
