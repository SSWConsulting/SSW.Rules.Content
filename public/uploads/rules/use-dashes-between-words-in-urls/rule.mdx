The text of a URL should make sense and relate to the content of the relevant page.                     Apart from helping with Google Juice users frequently read URL's.

There are a few options for how you format the text of a URL. The following suggestions                     are in preference order:

1. Dashes between words:
       **rules-to-better-website-layouts.aspx
** [RECOMMENDED] This option appears to be most common and
      [Craig Bailey](http://www.craigbailey.net/)'s ￼ preferred way
2. Capitalize each word (Title Case):
       **RulesToBetterWebsiteLayouts.aspx**
3. Upper case for appropriate words:
       **RulestoBetterWebsiteLayouts.aspx**
4. Underscores between words:
       **rules\_to\_better\_website\_layouts.aspx**
5. Lower case for all words:
       **rulestobetterwebsitelayouts.aspx**

The caveat here is that it will only work if the URL is in the clear on the page.

**Note:** This could only be done with certain links as others are postbacks as well.
