When standard prompts aren't enough, and you have a repetitive, complex task that requires specific context, it's time to build a Custom Agent (also known as a "Skill" or "Bot").

<endIntro />

### Understanding the Spectrum: Prompts → Custom Instructions → Agents

Level 1: Simple Prompts

A one-off instruction to an AI model. Good for quick, ad-hoc tasks.

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    “Summarize this document”
  </>}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure="A simple prompt has no persistence and requires re-explaining context every time"
  style="greybox"
/>

Level 2: System Prompts/Custom Instructions

A reusable set of instructions that define how the AI should behave. Think of this as giving the AI a “persona” or “role”

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    You are an expert .NET develoepr. Always suggest the latest C# syntax. Prefer dependency injection. Follow Clean Architecture principles.
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="A system prompt provides consistent behaviour but has no tools or autonomy"
  style="greybox"

Level 3: Custom Agents (Full Agents)

Custom agents are fully autonomous entities that combines:

* System prompts (persona and rules)
* Tools/Function calling (ability to take actions)
* Memory (context persistence)
* Domain knowledge (RAG, documentation, etc.)
* Hooks (pre/post execution scripts)

```yaml
name: HR-Bot
description: Handles employee onboarding queries and processes
system_prompt: |
  You are the HR Bot for {{company}}. You help with:
  - Onboarding procedures
  - Leave requests
  - Policy questions
  
  Always be friendly and reference the Employee Handbook.
  
tools:
  - lookup_employee_handbook
  - check_leave_balance
  - submit_leave_request
  
allowed_paths:
  - /docs/hr/**
  
hooks:
  pre: validate_employee_id.sh
  post: log_interaction.sh
```
