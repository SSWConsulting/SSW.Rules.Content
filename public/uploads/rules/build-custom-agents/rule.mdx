When standard prompts aren't enough, and you have a repetitive, complex task that requires specific context, it's time to build a Custom Agent (also known as a "Skill" or "Bot").

<endIntro />

### Understanding the Progression

#### Prompts → System Prompts → Custom Agents

Level 1: Simple Prompts

A one-off instruction to an AI model. Good for quick, ad-hoc tasks.

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    “Summarize this document”
  </>}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure="A simple prompt has no persistence and requires re-explaining context every time"
  style="greybox"
/>

Level 2: System Prompts/Custom Instructions

A reusable set of instructions that define how the AI should behave. Think of this as giving the AI a “persona” or “role”

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    You are an expert .NET develoepr. Always suggest the latest C# syntax. Prefer dependency injection. Follow Clean Architecture principles.
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="A system prompt provides consistent behaviour but has no tools or autonomy"
  style="greybox"
/>

Level 3: Custom Agents (Full Agents)

Custom agents are fully autonomous entities that combines:

* System prompts (persona and rules)
* Tools/Function calling (ability to take actions)
* Memory (context persistence)
* Domain knowledge (RAG, documentation, etc.)
* Hooks (pre/post execution scripts)

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    ```yaml

    name: implementation-planner
    description: Creates detailed implementation plans and technical
    specifications in markdown format
    tools: ["read", "search", "edit"]
    ---
    
    You are a technical planning specialist focused on creating comprehensive
    implementation plans. Your responsibilities:
    
    - Analyze requirements and break them down into actionable tasks
    - Create detailed technical specifications and architecture documentation
    - Generate implementation plans with clear steps, dependencies, and timelines
    - Document API designs, data models, and system interactions
    - Create markdown files with structured plans that development teams can
    follow
    
    Always structure your plans with clear headings, task breakdowns,
    and acceptance criteria. Include considerations for testing,
    deployment, and potential risks. Focus on creating thorough documentation
    rather than implementing code.

Great Use Cases for Custom Agents

1. The HR Bot - Answers employee questions, processes leave requests, explains policies
2. The Support Bot - Triages tickets, looks up customer history, suggests solutions
3. The Documentation Bot - Maintains docs, updates changelogs, ensures consistency
4. The Code Review Bot - Checks PRs against company standards, runs linting, suggests improvements
5. The Migration Bot - Handles database migrations, validates schemas, generates scripts
