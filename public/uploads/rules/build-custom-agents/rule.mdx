When standard prompts are not enough, and you have a repetitive, complex task, that requires a specific context, it's time to consider building a **Custom Agent** (also known as a “Skill” or a “Bot”).

<endIntro />

## When should you build an agent?

Before commiting to building a custom agent, it's worthwhile to validate your use case meets these criteria:

1. **Complex Decision-making:** Workflows involving nuanced judgment, exceptions, or context-sensitive information
2. **Difficult-to-maintain rules:** Systems that have become unwieldy due to extensive and intricate rulesets, making updates costly and error-prone
3. **Heavy reliance on unstructured data:** Scenarios that involve interpreting natural language, extracting meaning from documents, or interacting with users conversationally

### Structure of custom agents

At its most fundamental level, an agent consists of three core components:

1. **Model:** The LLM powering the agent's reasoning and decision-making
2. **Tools:** External functions or APIs the agent can use to take action
3. **Instructions:** Explicit guidelines and guardrails defining how the agent behaves

### Understanding the Progression

#### Prompts → System Prompts → Custom Agents

**Level 1: Simple Prompts **

A one-off instruction to an AI model. Good for quick, ad-hoc tasks.

    “Summarize this document”
  </>}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure="A simple prompt has no persistence and requires re-explaining context every time"
  style="greybox"
/>

**Level 2: System Prompts/Custom Instructions**

A reusable set of instructions that define how the AI should behave. Think of this as giving the AI a “persona” or “role”. For an example of this: [AGENTS.md from SSW's Clean Architecture Template](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.CleanArchitecture/blob/main/AGENTS.md)

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    You are an expert .NET developer. Always suggest the latest C# syntax. Prefer dependency injection. Follow Clean Architecture principles.
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="A system prompt provides consistent behaviour but has no tools or autonomy"
  style="greybox"
/>

**Level 3: Custom Agents**

Custom agents are fully autonomous entities that can combine:

* System prompts (persona and rules)
* Tools/Function calling (ability to take actions)
* Memory (context persistence)
* Domain knowledge (RAG, documentation, etc.)
* Hooks (pre/post execution scripts)

    You are a technical planning specialist focused on creating comprehensive
    implementation plans. Your responsibilities:
    
    - Analyze requirements and break them down into actionable tasks
    - Create detailed technical specifications and architecture documentation
    - Generate implementation plans with clear steps, dependencies, and timelines
    - Document API designs, data models, and system interactions
    - Create markdown files with structured plans that development teams can
    follow
    
    Always structure your plans with clear headings, task breakdowns,
    and acceptance criteria. Include considerations for testing,
    deployment, and potential risks. Focus on creating thorough documentation
    rather than implementing code.
