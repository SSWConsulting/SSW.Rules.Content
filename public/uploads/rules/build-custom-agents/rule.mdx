When you find yourself repeating the same complex prompts, or need a reusable unit of work within an agentic workflow, it's time to consider building a **custom agent**. 

<endIntro />

## What is a custom agent?

A **custom agent** is a reusable, task-specific agent designed to integrate into agentic workflows. Think of custom agents like functions in programming - they encapsulate specific capabilities that can be called when needed.

Key characteristics of custom agents:

* **Specialized scope** - focused on a specific task or domain (e.g., code review, implementation planning, testing)
* **Defined tools** - explicit access to only the tools needed for their purpose
* **Clear instructions** - a system prompt that defines behavior and guardrails
* **Reusable** - can be invoked across different workflows or by other agents

For example, Claude Code uses custom agents like `Explore` (for codebase exploration), `Plan` (for designing implementation approaches), and `Bash` (for command execution). Each has a narrow focus and specific toolset.

## When should you build a custom agent?

Like functions in code, custom agents help you avoid repeating yourself. Consider building one when:

* **You're repeating the same prompts** - if you keep giving the same instructions for similar tasks, encapsulate them in a custom agent
* **You need consistent behaviour** - when a task requires specific guardrails, tools, or domain knowledge every time
* **You want to delegate specialized work** - break complex workflows into focused custom agents that can be orchestrated together

## Example custom agent

  body={<>
    ```yaml

    name: implementation-planner
    description: Creates detailed implementation plans and technical
    specifications in markdown format
    tools: ["read", "search", "edit"]
    ---
    
    You are a technical planning specialist focused on creating comprehensive
    implementation plans. Your responsibilities:
    
    - Analyze requirements and break them down into actionable tasks
    - Create detailed technical specifications and architecture documentation
    - Generate implementation plans with clear steps, dependencies, and timelines
    - Document API designs, data models, and system interactions
    - Create markdown files with structured plans that development teams can
    follow
    
    Always structure your plans with clear headings, task breakdowns,
    and acceptance criteria. Include considerations for testing,
    deployment, and potential risks. Focus on creating thorough documentation
    rather than implementing code.

## Enhancing custom agents with skills

Custom agents can also be equipped with **skills** (slash commands) to guide their behavior for specific tasks. While tools give agents the ability to interact with external systems, skills inject specialized prompts and workflows that standardize how agents approach their work. See [Do you use MCP servers for context?](/rules/mcp-servers-for-context) for more on skills vs MCP servers.

For example, a code review agent could use a skill that enforces your team's review checklist, or an implementation planner agent could use a skill that ensures plans follow your organization's template.
