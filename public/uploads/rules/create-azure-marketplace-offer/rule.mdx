## Prerequisites

Before you begin creating your Azure Marketplace offer, ensure you have:

2. **Verified publisher profile** - Complete the publisher verification process with legal documents and tax information
3. **Azure subscription** - Required for testing your offer in a real Azure environment
4. **Technical solution ready** - Your application or service must be production-ready and meet Azure's technical requirements
5. **Business documentation** - Terms of use, privacy policy, and support contact information

## The key steps to creating an offer

### 1. Choose your offer type

Select the most appropriate offer type based on your solution:

- **Azure Application (Managed app)** - Solutions with managed resource deployment. See example: [SSW.EagleEye](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/ssw1700450141896.ssweagleeye?tab=Overview)
- **Azure Application (Solution template)** - Multi-resource deployments using ARM templates
- **Azure Container** - Containerized applications for Azure Container Instances/Kubernetes
- **Azure Virtual Machine** - VM-based applications with pre-configured software
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)** - Cloud applications with subscription billing

**Note:** See [Microsoft's offer type guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace-offers/determine-your-listing-type) for all available types.

### 2. Follow offer type-specific publishing guide

Different types of offers have different publishing steps. Follow Microsoft's [Publisher Guide by Offer Type](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace-offers/publisher-guide-by-offer-type) for detailed steps.

#### Example: Azure Application offer

Publishing an Azure Application offer involves several key phases:

1. **Plan your offer** - Choose between Solution Template or Managed Application based on your management and transaction needs
2. **Prepare technical assets** - Create ARM templates, managed application packages, and configure resource deployment
3. **Configure offer details** - Set up properties, offer listing with descriptions and media, preview audience, and technical configuration
4. **Create plans** - Define pricing models, availability, and plan-specific configurations
5. **Test and validate** - Use preview mode for end-to-end testing before full publication
6. **Market your offer** - Configure co-sell opportunities and CSP program participation

For detailed guidance on each step, see the [Azure Application publishing guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace-offers/plan-azure-application-offer).
