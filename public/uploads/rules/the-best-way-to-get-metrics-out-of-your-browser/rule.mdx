Lighthouse is an open-source tool built into Google Chrome that can audit for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, and more. Allowing you to improve the quality of web pages.

<endIntro />

You can run Lighthouse:

- In Chrome DevTools
- From the command line
- As a Node module

It runs a series of audits against a URL and then it generates a report on how well the page did. From there, you can use the failing audits as indicators on how to improve the page. Each audit has a reference doc explaining why the audit is important, as well as how to fix it.

### Lighthouse Level 1: Throttling Off

For applications intended for use on a desktop and from within a well-connected office (such as your intranet or office timesheet application) test with throttling turned off.

### Lighthouse Level 2: Throttling On

To see how well your website would perform on low-spec devices and with poor internet bandwidth, use the throttling features. This is most important for high volume, customer-facing apps.

### Lighthouse Level 3: Automated testing

For business-critical pages, you may want to automate Lighthouse testing as part of your Continuous Delivery pipeline. This blog post by Andrejs Abrickis shows [how to configure an Azure DevOps build pipeline that performs Lighthouse testing](https://andrejsabrickis.medium.com/continuously-audit-web-apps-performance-using-google-s-lighthouse-and-azure-devops-3e1623372f79).
