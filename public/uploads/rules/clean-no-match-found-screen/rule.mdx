When a user looks at a search result, they expect to see a list of items to look into. If there are no results, don't give them noisy text because it can be taken as a search result. An icon also can be understood as a broken page. Your "no results" page should be clean.

**Note:** In case the message you're showing is a "pass" or "fail, it is recommended to use an icon as per [Do you use icons to enforce the text meaning?](/do-you-use-icons-in-web-pages-to-enforce-the-text-meaning)
