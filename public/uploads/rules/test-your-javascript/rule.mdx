The need to build rich web user interfaces is resulting in more and more JavaScript in our applications.

Because JavaScript does not have the safeguards of strong typing and compile-time checking, it is just as important to unit test your JavaScript as your server-side code.

<endOfIntro />

You can write unit tests for JavaScript using:

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) **(Recommended)**
- [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html)
- [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/)

Jest is recommended since [it runs faster than Karma](https://charith-hettiarachchi.medium.com/why-use-jest-over-karma-for-angular-testing-b56ffa82f8) (due to the fact that Karma runs tests in a browser while Jest runs tests in Node).
