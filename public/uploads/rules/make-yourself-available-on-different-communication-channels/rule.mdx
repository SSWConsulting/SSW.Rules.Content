Prioritize Communication - Make yourself highly available on a number of communication channels.

When you’re working remotely, your colleagues can’t walk up and talk to you. They lose the ease of access to you to ask quick questions or discuss urgent matters.  Due to this, you need other forms of communication as a stop-gap.

When working remotely, communication is more important than when you’re in the office, and with great collaboration tools like Microsoft Teams, it’s hard to have an excuse not to be available.

When working from home your goal should be for customers to say:

Jason is a gun. Even though he works from home he is always available. I can reach out by any channel and I'm guaranteed to get a quick response.
