Since the release of [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) in 2021, we have witnessed a dramatic evolution in how developers work within their IDE. It started with a simple AI autocomplete, then a chat function, and now we are in an agentic gold mine. AI has now been integrated deeply into IDEs with products like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), embedding an even deeper level of AI integration within a developer's workflow.

## Powerful features that AI-Powered IDEs provide

### Code Completion

GitHub Copilot first popularized the 'code completion' feature for AI-powered IDEs. Code completion will try to guess what you are going to write, and suggest how to complete this line - saving time and effort by simply pressing 'tab'.

### Inline Code Generation

In Cursor (ctrl-K or command-K) and VSCode (ctrl-I or command-I), you are able to generate code at a given line with natural language. Useful if you want to change or add to a specific line without knowing the specifics.

### Chat

Chat functionality within an AI-powered IDE adds an intelligent assistant that can offer answers and suggestions without needing to leave the IDE. Unlike generic AI tools, it allows you to add context to your question, such as a file or even codebase, which lets the AI provide more tailored solutions.

### Agent

The Agent function in AI-powered IDEs represents a significant leap in a developer's workflow. It acts as a semi-autonomous coding assistant, capable of directly controlling the IDE (creating/editing files, reading the codebase, searching the web, executing bash commands) and search the web, as well call any MCP tools that have been integrated with the IDE.

## AI-Powered IDE Options

There are lots of AI-Powered IDEs on the market right now, and they are evolving constantly, introducing new features at a rapid pace. Here are some of our favourites:

* (⭐ Recommended) VSCode
* (⭐ Recommended) Cursor
* Windsurf
* Google Antigravity
* Trae
* Amazon Kiro

## Using the CLI for AI-assisted development

blah blah blah

✅ Pros

* Much larger context windows
* Can run for much longer without timing out

❌ Cons

* Requires a separate instance (???)
* Manual setup required

## A word of caution

AI is still very much a work in progress. It makes mistakes, especially when working with lesser-known programming languages and frameworks, and will often hallucinate. It is the developer's responsibility to ensure that the code they publish is optimized, and AI tools should only be used for assistance, and not as a direct replacement for a developer.

You wouldn't send an email written by ChatGPT without first checking it for correctness and intention. Similarly, you should not commit any code written by AI without first reading through it, and testing it.

You are solely responsible for the code you commit!

    Warning: Whilst other non-VSCode IDEs can run VSCode extensions, not all will work e.g. Microsoft licensing restricts the use of the .NET debugger to Microsoft builds of VSCode.
    
    See [.NET Debugger's licensing](https://github.com/dotnet/vscode-csharp/blob/main/docs/debugger/Microsoft-.NET-Core-Debugger-licensing-and-Microsoft-Visual-Studio-Code.md)

## Which is best?

As you can see from the comparison table, each of the AI-powered IDEs rival each other in most categories, and you can't go wrong with any of them.

Currently, SSW Developers tend to prefer Cursor, and it seems to have more hype based on [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com.au/trends/explore?q=cursor%20ide,windsurf%20ide\&hl=en). However, Windsurf is a formidable competitor in the battle for the best AI-powered IDE.

Note: In some regions, such as China, tools like Cursor and Claude are restricted from access. In such cases, [Trae](https://www.trae.ai/) serves as a great alternative. Trae is developed by ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok.

    **Tip**: Investing in one of these tools may prove to be worthwhile, and you can always claim it as a tax deduction.
