Spinning up on an unfamiliar project used to be a stressful experience - it could take developers months to learn the architecture, code patterns, and libraries that are used. And that's not even talking about the application's features and functionality.

But with intelligent use of AI, this on-boarding time can be reduced to almost zero. We can now get on-demand analysis into projects, bugs, and features in minutes. Learn how to do it right.

## The old way - RTFM

Historically, when you were first put onto a new project, you'd immediately look for documentation. Architecture diagrams, specifications, class diagrams, etc. If you were lucky enough to find them, you'd pray they were up-to-date with the actual code. And even in those best-case scenarios, you'd still have to translate that information into finding the code you were meant to be working on.

All of this took time, and would often send you down programming cul-de-sacs when you discovered features, requirements, or behaviour differed from the literature. The only way to know what was actually going on was to start digging through the source code.

## The new way - Investigation Prompts

Whenever SSW start on a new project, we ask AI to give us an analysis of whatever feature or bug we're looking at. Instead of spending hours (or days) exploring an unfamiliar codebase, you can get on-demand documentation of exactly what, where, and how the feature is implemented.

But producing a useful report without **AI slop TODO: Add link to AI SLOP** takes some skill, so let's break it down.
