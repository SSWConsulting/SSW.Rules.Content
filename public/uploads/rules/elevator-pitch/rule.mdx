<introEmbed
  body={<>
The first impression given to a prospective client or employee is essential to forming their image of a company. A bad impression means they are unlikely to be interested.

## The scenario

Consider the situation where you jump in an elevator and start chatting to the other person and they ask *"What does your company do?"*

There is probably under 60 seconds to give an answer that will excite them about your company.
  </>}
/>
This conversation is called the "elevator pitch", and knowing how to do it is crucial.

This doesn't just happen in elevators, this can happen when you meet a new client, it can happen at an event, it can happen when you're at a barbecue with a friend. The more effort you put into doing this well, the better you will sound.

Although not everybody is in sales, we all will have to convince others at different times.

## How to form an elevator pitch

To form an elevator pitch, it is important to collate your thoughts about the ethos of the company. Consider these areas:

### #1 The What

Think about what your company does and for whom, focus on the problems they solve.

For example:

* We build enterprise custom software for businesses.

**Tip:** You might have 15 great points, but start the conversation with a couple of important ones. Consider who you are speaking to when choosing the highest value points.

### #2 The Unique Value

Now think about the unique value the company delivers to clients and note it down too.

For example:

* We work in Scrum teams
* We build with Microsoft technologies
* We use and publish best practices

### #3 The Where

Finally, where do you do business?

For example, the company might have offices in:

* Sydney
* Melbourne
* Brisbane
* Newcastle
* Hangzhou
* Strasbourg

### #4 Now practice

Now you have a few bullet points, go outside and record a quick video from memory. Here's a few tips to get it right:

* Hook people in - Make sure to mention the question at the start, so people have a little context.
* Practice and perfect it - Do a few takes until it feels right

There you go, that's your elevator pitch!
