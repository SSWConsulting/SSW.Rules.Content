### One email or Product Backlog Item per task

The best way for this to work is to break tasks into the smallest possible [bite-size pieces](/management-do-you-use-just-in-time-speccing) and ensure that those pieces are in the project plan explicitly.

Sometimes software developers miss a related item that you might consider 'blindingly obvious.' For example, you might ask them to fix a combo box on one form in a legacy application. But they mightn't know about the 3 other forms that the same type of combo appears on. So if you also want them fixed, then let them know about them!

### Get approval for UI changes

Make sure software consultants [conduct specifications by creating mock-ups](/storyboards).
