When you're scoping the work to be completed, ensure you are as accurate as possible in your requirements.

### Be specific

::: greybox
_"I want to keep contact details on my clients"_
:::

::: bad
Figure: Bad example - Likely to require later clarification
:::

::: greybox
_"I want to record my clients' firstname, surname, mobile phone, email address & Instant Messenger address."_
:::

::: good
Figure: Good example - You'll get exactly what you want. Even better, use screenshots or mock-ups

### One email or Product Backlog Item per task

The best way for this to work is to break tasks into the smallest possible [bite-size pieces](/management-do-you-use-just-in-time-speccing) and ensure that those pieces are in the project plan explicitly.

Sometimes software developers miss a related item that you might consider 'blindingly obvious.' For example, you might ask them to fix a combo box on one form in a legacy application. But they mightn't know about the 3 other forms that the same type of combo appears on. So if you also want them fixed, then let them know about them!

### Get approval for UI changes

Make sure software consultants [conduct specifications by creating mock-ups](/storyboards).
