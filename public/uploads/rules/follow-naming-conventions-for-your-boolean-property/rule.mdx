seoDescription: Boolean Property naming convention follows a specific pattern to clearly
  indicate its state.

Boolean Properties must be prefixed by a verb. Verbs like "Supports", "Allow", "Accept", "Use" should be valid. Also properties like "Visible", "Available" should be accepted (maybe not). See [how to name Boolean columns in SQL databases](/use-bit-numeric-data-type-correctly).

<endOfIntro />

```csharp
public bool Enable { get; set; }
public bool Invoice { get; set; }
```

### Naming Boolean state Variables in Frontend code

When it comes to state management in frameworks like Angular or React, a similar principle applies, but with a focus on the continuity of the action.

For instance, if you are tracking a process or a loading state, the variable should reflect the ongoing nature of these actions. Instead of "isLoaded" or "isProcessed," which suggest a completed state, use names like "isLoading" or "isProcessing."

These names start as false, change to true while the process is ongoing, and revert to false once completed.

```js
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false); // Initial state: not loading
```


<boxEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    **Note:** When an operation begins, isLoading is set to true, indicating the process is active. Upon completion, it's set back to false.
  </>}
  figurePreset="defaultExample"
  figureText={"XXX"}
/>


This naming convention avoids confusion, such as a variable named isLoaded that would be true before the completion of a process and then false, which is counterintuitive and misleading.

We have a program called [SSW CodeAuditor](https://codeauditor.com) to check for this rule.
