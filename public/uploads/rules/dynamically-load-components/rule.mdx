Components with large imports loaded in on runtime may result in a much worse UX for users of your web app. Next.js can help with this by using [dynamic imports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import) to only load these large components when they are rendered on the page.
  </>}
/>
When using the Next.js pages router, we can use `next/dynamic` to lazy load components, based on React's [`React.lazy`](https://react.dev/reference/react/lazy) and [`Suspense`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense).

```jsx
const HeavyComponent = dynamic(import("./components/HeavyComponent"), {
  loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>,
});

export const Page = () => {
  const [showComponent, setShowComponent] = useState(false);

  return (
    <>
      ...
      {showComponent && <HeavyComponent />}
      ...
    </>
  );
};
```

This means that the `<HeavyComponent>` element will only be loaded in when the `showComponent` state variable is true. When condition is then set to `true`, the paragraph component in the `loading` field will display until the component has been loaded onto the page.

This works by packing the heavy component into a separate JavaScript bundle, which Next.js then sends to the client when the `showComponent` variable is true.

You can learn more about how to use `next/dynamic` in the [official Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/lazy-loading#nextdynamic).
