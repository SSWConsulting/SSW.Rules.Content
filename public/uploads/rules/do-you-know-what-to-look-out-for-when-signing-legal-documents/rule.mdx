There are a few things to look out for when signing legal documents:
  </>}
/>
1. Make sure there are no specific damages mentioned in any legal document. They should always be left to the relevant courts to decide.
2. Make sure the courts that would be adjudicating any conflict are local. (i.e. in your state or at least your country).
3. Lastly, for time and materials style software projects, make sure that there is a common understanding of how bugs are handled. i.e. there is no warranty on work done, as bugs are just a natural part of software development
