If there's anything to be learned from spammers, they know how to get your attention. Spammers use very tabloid-based, or headline-grabbing subjects, to try and coerce you into opening that email. But don't make your email subjects tabloid-tacky, instead follow a good broadsheet paper's style of attention-grabbing lines.

Just as we are told, 'Don't judge a book by its cover', we sometimes judge an email by its subject.
We send and receive so many emails each day, therefore it's important to use the email subject to grab your recipient's attention.

Choosing the right subject can give an email a sense of urgency or importance and allows the user to quickly glance through the inbox to assist with prioritization.
This is especially important when trying to get your clients and suppliers to take notice of your email.

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    Subject: **üïë Reminder about event**
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: 'Bad example - Easily missed, can\'t get the main information without reading the email',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
/>

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    Subject: **üïë 6:30PM Tonight! See you at the User Group**
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: 'Good example - Definitely going to read this email',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
/>

The best way of doing this is to ensure that your subject includes either a:

* **Action point**
  E.g. **"6.30 TONIGHT! See you at The Oaks Hotel..."**

* **Result** of a task you were asked to do
  E.g. **"Charles Merton - 5 min of feedback"**.

You'll note from this that including the date and time in the subject gives immediacy to the email.

<asideEmbed
  variant="info"
  body={<>
    **Warning:** Never leave the subject blank! It's like writing a book and failing to give it a name!
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

## Good subject examples

Always use a descriptive email subject to make it easier to find later. Use [emojis](/use-emojis) and [prefixes](/prefixes) to give context straight away.

### Consulting

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    Subject: **üïë Northwind - Future - Meeting to get your software solution rolling, next Monday 2PM**
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

### Dinner

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    Subject: **üç¥ Dinner Tonight, 6.30PM at The Oaks**
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

### Bugs

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    Subject: **üêõ BUG - Northwind form - Button not working**
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

### Call someone

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    Subject: **üì± SSW User Group - This month needs a speaker - Call Tom Howe pronto!**
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

### Feedback on a product

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    Subject: **üé® Northwind app - User Interface feedback**
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

### [Test please](/request-a-test-please)

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    Subject: **üß™ Test Please - Product Name v1.11**
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

Of course, we also use a structured approach for emails - especially when sending them internally.

We use the following format for the subject internally and encourage clients and external contacts to use this format as well.

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    Subject: **&#123;&#123; EMOJI &#125;&#125; &#123;&#123; PROJECT TOUCHED &#125;&#125; - &#123;&#123; BUSINESS AREA TOUCHED &#125;&#125; - &#123;&#123; SHORT DESCRIPTION &#125;&#125;**
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

Example:

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    Subject: **üìß Northwind ‚Äì IOP ‚Äì Customer.aspx - Add email address validation**
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

The advantage of this is that when you sort by the subject in Outlook, you get all of the emails grouped together, and it is easy to recognize the client/product, because the subject contains the relevant information.

<asideEmbed
  variant="info"
  body={<>
    **Tip:** When referring to a website, it's a good idea to include the URL in the email subject.
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

Additionally, you should be able to determine which emails are the most important. Using a meaningful subject with keywords makes it easy to identify and categorize emails without actually opening them (and it also makes it easy to find them in "Sent Items"). When emails are really important, write IMPORTANT in the subject. Other emails considered important or urgent should have the following in the subject field:

* BUG
* INCOMPLETE
* URGENT

Other words to be used are:

* TIMESHEETS
* INVOICES
* PROSPECT
* TO-DO - for tasks pending
* FYI - information you want to keep around for a while, for yourself or for others (never for a task)
* FUTURE - ideas for the future
* IGNORE - for the rare occasion when something is requested and you really don't want to do it yet
* Product name - Registered User Support
* Product name - Pre-Sales Support
* Project name
* Client name

<asideEmbed
  variant="info"
  body={<>
    **Remember:** For external emails, it is acceptable to [change an email subject](/do-you-know-when-you-should-change-a-subject) in certain circumstances.

For internal emails, the subject should generally **not** be changed as it will break the threading of emails.
