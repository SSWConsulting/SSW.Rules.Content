If there's anything to be learned from spammers, they know how to get your attention. Spammers use very tabloid-based, or headline-grabbing subjects, to try and coerce you into opening that email. But don't make your email subjects tabloid-tacky, instead follow a good broadsheet paper's style of attention-grabbing lines.

Just as we are told, 'Don't judge a book by its cover', we sometimes judge an email by its subject.
We send and receive so many emails each day, therefore it's important to use the email subject to grab your recipient's attention.

Choosing the right subject can give an email a sense of urgency or importance and allows the user to quickly glance through the inbox to assist with prioritization.
This is especially important when trying to get your clients and suppliers to take notice of your email.


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    Subject: **🕑 Reminder about event**
  </>}
  captionStyle="badExample"
  caption={"Bad example - Easily missed, can't get the main information without reading the email"}
/>



<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    Subject: **🕑 6:30PM Tonight! See you at the User Group**
  </>}
  captionStyle="goodExample"
  caption={"Good example - Definitely going to read this email"}
/>


The best way of doing this is to ensure that your subject includes either a:

* **Action point**
  E.g. **"6.30 TONIGHT! See you at The Oaks Hotel..."**

* **Result** of a task you were asked to do
  E.g. **"Charles Merton - 5 min of feedback"**.

You'll note from this that including the date and time in the subject gives immediacy to the email.

  style="info"
  body={<>
    **Warning:** Never leave the subject blank! It's like writing a book and failing to give it a name!
  </>}
  captionStyle="default"
  caption={""}
/>


## Good subject examples

Always use a descriptive email subject to make it easier to find later. Use [emojis](/use-emojis) and [prefixes](/prefixes) to give context straight away.

### Consulting


<boxEmbed

  body={<>
    Subject: **🕑 Northwind - Future - Meeting to get your software solution rolling, next Monday 2PM**
  </>}

### Dinner

  body={<>
    Subject: **🍴 Dinner Tonight, 6.30PM at The Oaks**
  </>}

### Bugs

### Call someone

Of course, we also use a structured approach for emails - especially when sending them internally.

We use the following format for the subject internally and encourage clients and external contacts to use this format as well.


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    Subject: **&#123;&#123; EMOJI &#125;&#125; &#123;&#123; PROJECT TOUCHED &#125;&#125; - &#123;&#123; BUSINESS AREA TOUCHED &#125;&#125; - &#123;&#123; SHORT DESCRIPTION &#125;&#125;**
  </>}
  captionStyle="default"
  caption={""}
/>


Example:


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    Subject: **📧 Northwind – IOP – Customer.aspx - Add email address validation**
  </>}
  captionStyle="default"
  caption={""}
/>


The advantage of this is that when you sort by the subject in Outlook, you get all of the emails grouped together, and it is easy to recognize the client/product, because the subject contains the relevant information.


<boxEmbed
  style="info"
  body={<>
    **Tip:** When referring to a website, it's a good idea to include the URL in the email subject.
  </>}
  captionStyle="default"
  caption={""}
/>


Additionally, you should be able to determine which emails are the most important. Using a meaningful subject with keywords makes it easy to identify and categorize emails without actually opening them (and it also makes it easy to find them in "Sent Items"). When emails are really important, write IMPORTANT in the subject. Other emails considered important or urgent should have the following in the subject field:

* BUG
* INCOMPLETE
* URGENT

Other words to be used are:

* TIMESHEETS
* INVOICES
* PROSPECT
* TO-DO - for tasks pending
* FYI - information you want to keep around for a while, for yourself or for others (never for a task)
* FUTURE - ideas for the future
* IGNORE - for the rare occasion when something is requested and you really don't want to do it yet
* Product name - Registered User Support
* Product name - Pre-Sales Support
* Project name
* Client name


<boxEmbed
  style="info"
  body={<>
    **Remember:** For external emails, it is acceptable to [change an email subject](/do-you-know-when-you-should-change-a-subject) in certain circumstances.

For internal emails, the subject should generally **not** be changed as it will break the threading of emails.
