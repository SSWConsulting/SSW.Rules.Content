Imagine you're browsing a website. You come across an area on the page that seems oddly blank, only to realize it's a white image blending seamlessly into the white background. This disrupts the browsing experience. So how do you prevent that?

## The Importance of Image Borders

Making your images distinct is a key part of creating a user-friendly website. You should add borders to images, especially those with a white or light-colored background.

* **Visibility**: A border makes the image stand out, even if the website's background color matches the image's color.
* **Professionalism**: Borders can add a sense of completeness to your site's design.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: "Bad Example - Can't tell where the image begins and ends!",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/borders-around-white-images/white-no-border.png"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good Example - This looks much better",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/borders-around-white-images/white-border.png"
