Imagine you're browsing a website. You come across an area on the page that seems oddly blank, only to realize it's a white image blending seamlessly into the white background. This disrupts the browsing experience. So how do you prevent that?

## The Importance of Image Borders

Making your images distinct is a key part of creating a user-friendly website. You should add borders to images, especially those with a white or light-colored background.

* **Visibility**: A border makes the image stand out, even if the website's background color matches the image's color.
* **Professionalism**: Borders can add a sense of completeness to your site's design.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: 'Bad Example - Can\'t tell where the image begins and ends!',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/borders-around-white-images/white-no-border.png"
/>

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: 'Good Example - This looks much better',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/borders-around-white-images/white-border.png"
/>

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    Note: You should also add a [useful caption to every image](/add-useful-and-concise-figure-captions/).
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
