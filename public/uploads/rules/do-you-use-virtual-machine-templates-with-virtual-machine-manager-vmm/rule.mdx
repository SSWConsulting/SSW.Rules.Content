Using Virtual Machine (VM) templates makes it easy to deploy consistent VM setting using VMM.

<endOfIntro />

There are 2 types of templates:

1. VM templates, which are database objects stored in the VMM library, used to quickly set up VMs
     2. Service templates, which defines how a service is configured. They hold information about the VMs, which application to install on VMs, and the network settings that should be used.

You can create a VM template from an existing virtual hard disk, or from an existing VM deployed on a host.

To see how this is done, you can check [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/system-center/vmm/library-vm-templates?view=sc-vmm-2019&WT.mc_id=DP-MVP-33518).
