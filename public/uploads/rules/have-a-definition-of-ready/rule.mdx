Just like how the team has a **[Definition of Done](/definition-of-done)** as a checklist for completing a PBI; the Product Owner needs a **Definition of Ready (DoR)** to get the PBI in a state that’s ready to be added to a Sprint. This should be done as part of the refinement (aka grooming) process and will greatly streamline the Sprint Planning meeting.

A recommended “Definition of Ready” would have:

* Enough detail for the team to action (usually via good **[Acceptance Criteria](/acceptance-criteria)**)
* **[Business Value](/do-you-estimate-business-value)** assigned
* **Effort** assigned
* **Approved** state

/>

When the PBI is approved, [ask for a signature (or simply an initial) as a prove of approval](/ask-clients-approval).

    **Warning:** PBIs might be accepted into a Sprint even if they do **not** meet the DoR. When that happens, there will be **more risk** and **uncertainty** around the PBI. It is highly discouraged for not-ready PBIs to be included in a Sprint, as they can hinder progress and disrupt the team's workflow.

### INVEST principle

The acronym INVEST serves as a helpful reminder of a widely accepted set of criteria, or checklist, used to evaluate the quality of a PBI. If a story does not meet one of these criteria, the team may need to revise or even rewrite it for better clarity and effectiveness.

  body={<>
    PBIs should follow the INVEST principle:

**"I" ndependent** (of all others)
**"N" egotiable** (not a specific contract for features)
**"V" aluable** (or vertical)
**"E" stimable** 👑 (to a good approximation)
**"S" mall** (so as to fit within an iteration)
**"T" estable** 👑 (in principle, even if there isn’t a test for it yet)
  </>}

While acronyms like INVEST can seem over-elaborate, they offer a helpful framework to ensure consistency and clarity in evaluating PBIs.

Following the update to the Scrum Guide for 2020, this is the concept of a Product Backlog being "Ready".
