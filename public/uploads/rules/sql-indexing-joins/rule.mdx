<introEmbed

So you've identified that you need to improve the performance of a SQL JOIN. How can you create an index to improve the performance?
  </>}

Joins behave just like a where clause. So for this statement:

```sql
SELECT
 u.DisplayName,
 c.CreationDate,
FROM
 dbo.Users u
 INNER JOIN dbo.Comments c ON u.Id = c.UserId
Where
 u.DisplayName = 'Jernej Kavka'
```

The following index would provide a performance increase.

```sql
CREATE INDEX IX_UserId_INCLUDES_CreationDate on dbo.Comments (UserId, CreationDate)
```

Note the fact that rather than including CreationDate in an included column it's been included in the indexed columns. That's because dates are a nice small column type, so the extra storage in the index tree nodes is negligible.
