<introEmbed
  body={<>
Ensure your links are easily distinguishable from the background and surrounding text by **always making them underlined**. Users expect underlined texts to be a link; and links to be underlined.
  </>}
/>
**Note:** Underlines are **not** necessary on obvious links, like **menu/breadcrumb items** or **buttons**. On the other hand, hover effect (see more below) should always exist.

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    For more information on this, please go to [SSW website](https://www.ssw.com.au).
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good example - The link is nice and clear",
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
/>

<asideEmbed
  variant="info"
  body={<>
    **Tip:** You can [use a different color on underlines](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_text-decoration-color.asp) as a nice touch.
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

## Never underline a text that isn't a link

Use bold or another styling if you need emphasis.

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    When you develop on SharePoint, you &lt;u&gt;do not&lt;/u&gt; have a full copy of web.config in your Visual Studio project.
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: "Bad example - Never underline the text when it isn't a link",
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
/>

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    When you develop on SharePoint, you **do not** have a full copy of web.config in your Visual Studio project.
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good example - Using bold for emphasis",
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
/>

## Include a hovering effect

Rollovers are also important as they offer visual feedback to a user that this link that will take them somewhere. While there is a myriad of ways to do this; color change is recommended because it preserves text readability. Hover the good example above to see this working.

The basic CSS for changing the link color on hover is:

``` css
a:hover {
    color: #cc4141;
}
```

### Avoid other effects on hover for text

Effects like **bold**, **scaling**, **rotation**, or **background changes** can distort text, making it harder for users to read and interact with links.
<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: "Bad example - Using bold on hovering may cause a text shift",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/underlined-links/bad-example-bold-hover.gif"
/>

**Note:** These effects may be used for buttons or other non-text content elements.

## Do not use borders to replace underlines

The default implementation of underlines in CSS is `text-decoration: underline;`.

Another way to add look-alike underlines is by adding `border-bottom: 1px;`, for example. In this case, you could even have a **dotted** line under the text. It's **not recommended** you use this method - It may create extra pixels in the interface, which can potentially cause other problems in your UI:
<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: "Bad example - The different border size pushes the content down",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/underlined-links/border-problem-1.gif"
/>
<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: "Bad example - Borders going over the text area",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/underlined-links/border-problem-2.png"
/>
