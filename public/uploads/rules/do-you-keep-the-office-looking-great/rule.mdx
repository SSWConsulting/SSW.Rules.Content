The PA is often the face of the business. It is important to encourage everyone to keep the space looking as good as possible.

If your boss is the host of a meeting, the space must be presentable and set up appropriately (for example, if the meeting will require the use of a computer or projector, ensure there are plugs and a space for them to be used).

If the space has been double-booked or is already in use, call your boss as early as possible to arrange for an alternative location.
