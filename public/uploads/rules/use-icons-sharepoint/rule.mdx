<introEmbed
  body={<>
Out of the box, SharePoint provides widgets (aka webparts) to style your link with a consistent look and feel. Standard left-navigation also supports emojis 💖.
  </>}
/>
If that's not enough and you want to customize your own links somewhere else on screen, use CSS to match the extension at the end of the `<a>` tag. Don't forget to add some padding to give it some space before the text (where the icon will be).

### Option A: Standard left navigation + emojis 💖

If you want to style your navigation, using emojis is the simplest way to achieve consistency.


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Consistent look using emojis in the standard left-navigation",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/use-icons-sharepoint/standard-left-nav.png"
/>

✅ UI - Consistent icons
✅ No-code solution (configuration only)
✅ Fast to load (no extra CSS to load)
✅ Free $ (Out of the box)
✅ Can be used in any size
❌ Somewhat limited choice

### Option B: Navigation using buttons via configurable Webparts (Recommended)

Using webparts is the best way to achieve a consistent look and feel. Webparts can be customized by admin users, and require no maintenance as far as styling is concerned. SharePoint uses Office UI Fabric icons under the hood.


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Consistent look using out of the box \"Quicklinks\" webpart",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/use-icons-sharepoint/navigation-with-webpart.png"
/>

✅ UI - Consistent emojis
✅ No-code solution (configuration only)
✅ Fast to load (no extra CSS to load)
✅ Free $ (Out of the box)
✅ Can be used in any size
✅ Large choice of icons
