<introEmbed
  body={<>
By using logging, the developer has access to more information when a particular error occurs like which functions were called, what state is the application currently in and what certain variables are. This is important as a simple stack trace will only tell you **where** the error occurred but not **how** it occurred.

[Log4Net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/log4net/) is an open-source logging library for .NET based on the Log4J library. It provides a simple to use library to enable logging in your application. It provides several logging options such as:

- XML File (Recommended)
- Text File
- Database
- Rolling log file
- Console

Log4Net also provides different levels of tracing - from INFO to DEBUG to ERROR - and allows you to easily change the logging level (through the config file)

We have a program called [SSW CodeAuditor](https://ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/) to check for this rule.
