Null-conditional operators - makes checking for null as easy as inserting a single question mark. The Null-conditional operators feature boils down all of the previously laborious clunky code into a single question mark.

<endIntro />

```cs
int length = customer != null && customer.name != null ? customer.name.length : 0;
```
**❌ Figure: Bad example - Verbose and complex code checking for nulls**  

```cs
int length = customers?.name?.length ?? 0;
```
**✅ Figure: Good example - Robust and easier to read code**
