Making sure that your site content to include specific keywords is just one part of the story. You need to constantly monitor how they perform.

<endIntro />

The two main tools for keywords (and most of SEO research) are:

- [ahrefs.com](http://ahrefs.com/)
- [semrush.com](http://semrush.com/)

It's better to use paid versions, but there are free versions with a limited set of features that are still useful.
