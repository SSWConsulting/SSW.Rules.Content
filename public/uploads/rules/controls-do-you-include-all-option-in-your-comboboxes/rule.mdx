  body={<>
ComboBoxes are often used for filtering data. It is best to have an '-All-' option to give your user chances to select all data.

It is important to understand the idea of **visual text** . In a list you could see either:

* -None- or
* No activity assigned

They both have the same meaning, but the first one is immediately visible whereas the second one must be read.

If the ID column in your database is a string data type, it is useful to add a constraint to limit the types of characters that it can contain. Adding a constraint can make it simpler to build your front-end, as you won't need to worry about encoding or escaping to handle special characters.

In SQL Server, you can add a check constraint that limits your column to alphanumeric characters, a hyphen, or underscore using the following T-SQL:

```sql
ALTER TABLE [TableName] ADD CONSTRAINT CK_String_Identifier
    CHECK ([StringIdColumn] NOT LIKE'%[^a-zA-Z0-9_\-]%')
```

Also, keep it simple!

    preset: "badExample",
    figure: "Bad example - '-All Stores-' isn't needed",
