Due to Blazor using C#, your client and server can share the same model library - sharing behavior and data.

This will reduce the amount of code you need to write, and make it easier to maintain.

<endIntro />

To share your classes between the client and server, just create a class library and reference it in your client and server projects.

See [Blazor Code Sharing Example](https://github.com/bradystroud/BlazorCodeSharingExample) as an example.
