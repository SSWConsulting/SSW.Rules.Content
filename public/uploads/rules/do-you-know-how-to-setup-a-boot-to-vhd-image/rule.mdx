Using Boot to VHD is very similar to dual-booting your machine, except that you do not have to partition your hard drive. It also has performance benefits over using a Hyper-V server for presentations.

<endIntro />

**Pre-Requisites**

- The presentation computer running Windows
- A SysPreped VHD image to be deployed onto the presentation computer

1. Copy a SysPreped VHD image to the laptop to be used for the presentation.
2. Open an Administrative command prompt.
3. Type:

```bash
bcdedit /copy {default} /d “Demo-NameOfDemo”
```

**Figure - Creating the entry using BCDEdit shows your GUID** 4. Type:

```bash
bcdedit /set <GUID>  device vhd=[D:]\VM-DEV-SharePoint_2010_Public_Beta.vhd
```

**D:\*\* is the drive the VHD is located and **VM-DEV-SharePoint_2010_Public_Beta.vhd** is the location of your VHD file. Make sure you replace **&lt;GUID&gt;\*\* with the GUID you got in the previous step. 5. Type:

```bash
bcdedit /set <GUID>  osdevice vhd=[D:]\VM-DEV-SharePoint_2010_Public_Beta.vhd
```

**D:\*\* is the drive the VHD is located and **VM-DEV-SharePoint_2010_Public_Beta.vhd** is the location of your VHD file. Make sure you replace **&lt;GUID&gt;\*\* with the GUID you got in the previous step. 6. Type:

```bash
bcdedit /set <GUID> detecthal on
```

**Figure - Each time you run a BCDEdit command it should return "The operation completed successfully"** 7. Reboot the computer and now you will have the option to choose between Windows 7 and the new Boot to VHD image.
