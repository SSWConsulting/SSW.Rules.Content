You can have the best solution and the strongest team, but still lose a tender if your response feels generic, supplier-centric, or disconnected from what the customer actually cares about. This usually happens because teams start writing before they agree on *how they are going to win*.

<endIntro />

Defining clear Win Strategies and Win Themes upfront ensures your tender tells a focused, persuasive story that evaluators can easily understand, remember, and score highly.

## What is a Win Strategy?

A Win Strategy is the deliberate plan for how you will win a specific opportunity. It is set before writing begins and guides every decision made during the tender process.

To work out your win Strategy, you need to identify the following.

1. The customer’s real issues and buying drivers
2. The decision makers and what matters to them
3. The competitive landscape
4. Your chosen Win Themes (more on this below)
5. How your solution is positioned
6. Key risks and how they will be mitigated

### What a Win Strategy does

A well-defined Win Strategy:

* Prevents generic, compliance-only responses
* Aligns the team on messaging and positioning
* Shapes the Executive Summary
* Determines whether the opportunity is worth pursuing
* Guides what evidence is included and how it is presented

### What a Win Strategy is not

A Win Strategy is not:

* A technical design
* A project plan
* A list of answers to RFT questions
* A marketing document

Think of the Win Strategy as the blueprint for the tender. Without it, even well-written responses tend to feel unfocused and are much harder to win.

    Win Strategy:
    
    Win by demonstrating our strong technical capability, experienced team, and proven delivery methodology. Respond thoroughly to all RFT questions and highlight our certifications, tools, and past projects to show we are a safe choice.

## What are Win Themes?

Win Themes are the small number of client-specific messages (typically **1–3**, no more than **5**) that explain *why the customer should choose your company over every other option*.

They are not slogans or generic value statements. A Win Theme must be tangible, customer-relevant, and supported by evidence.

Win Themes are the evaluator’s reasons to believe that your company is the best choice.

### What Win Themes do

Effective Win Themes:

* Connect the customer’s key issues to your strengths
* Reinforce your differentiation throughout the response
* Provide consistency across all sections of the tender
* Help evaluators quickly understand and remember our value

### Characteristics of strong Win Themes

Strong Win Themes are:

* Directly relevant to the customer’s priorities
* Written in the customer’s language
* Supported by evidence
* Repeated consistently across the response
* Easy to recognise and remember

## What Win Themes are not

Win Themes are not:

* Marketing taglines
* Lists of capabilities
* Generic claims like “best in class” or “industry leading”
* Statements that every competitor could make
* Internally focused messages about your company rather than the customer

Tender responses should always be about **what matters to the customer**, not just what we think is impressive about ourselves.

## &#x20;Examples

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    “SSW stands above other vendors because of our hiring process and the quality of our people.”
  </>}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure="Supplier-centric, impossible to verify, and something every competitor can claim."
  style="greybox"
/>

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    “SSW’s experienced delivery team ensures high quality outcomes and reduces delivery risk for the customer.”
  </>}
  figurePrefix="ok"
  figure="More customer-focused, but still generic and unsupported by evidence."
  style="greybox"
/>

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    “Because SSW has already delivered and supported custom solutions within your .NET-based platform, we understand your architecture, integration points, and delivery standards. This reduces onboarding time, lowers delivery risk, and enables measurable progress within the first Sprint, rather than the typical discovery-heavy start required by new vendors.”
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Client-specific, clearly differentiated, outcome-focused, and supported by implied evidence."
  style="greybox"
/>

## Win Themes must flow through the entire response

Tender responses are often split into sections, with different evaluators scoring different parts independently. Every major section should reinforce at least one Win Theme.

This ensures that:

* Evaluators quickly grasp why your company is the best choice
* Key messages are remembered during scoring and comparison
* The response feels cohesive and intentional rather than fragmented

## Summary

Win Strategies and Win Themes are critical to winning tenders. The Win Strategy sets the direction, while Win Themes provide the memorable, customer-focused reasons to choose you. When done well, they make your tender more persuasive, consistent, and far more likely to win.
