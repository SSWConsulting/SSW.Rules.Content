Too often, developers are writing a line of code, and they forget that little bit of syntax they need to do what they want. In that case, they usually end up googling it to find the documentation and then copy and paste it into their code. That process is a pain because it wastes valuable dev time. They might also ask another dev for help.

Not to worry, AI pair programming is here to save the day!

New tools like [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) provide devs with potentially complete solutions as they type. It might sound like it's too good to be true, but in reality you can do so much with these tools.

> "It’s hard to believe that GitHub Copilot is actually an AI and not a Mechanical Turk. The quality of the code is at the very least comparable to my own (and in fairness that's me bragging), and it's staggering to see how accurate it is in determining your needs, even in the most obscure scenarios."

## What can it do?

There is a lot to love with AI pair programming ❤️, here is just a taste of what it can do:

### Help with writing code

* Populate a form
* Do complex maths
* Create DTOs
* Hydrate data
* Query APIs
* Do unit tests

### GitHub Copilot - Help with reading and understanding code

* Generate Pull Request summaries
* Explore and learn about a codebase
* Understand PBIs and how to implement them

Some tools that offer this are [GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/using-github-copilot/asking-github-copilot-questions-in-githubcom) or [Codeium](https://codeium.com/) (not to be confused with Codium).

## Why is it awesome?

AI pair programming has so much to offer, here are the key benefits:

1. **Efficiency** - Less time doing gruntwork like repetitive tasks and making boilerplate
2. **Learnability** - Quick suggestions in heaps of languages, such as:
    * C#
    * JavaScript
    * SQL, and many more
