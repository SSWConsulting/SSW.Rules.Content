One of the hardest things to deal with when presenting to an audience is the correct way to deal with questions.

Try and give firm guidelines when you start as to the correct way to ask a question.

It is quite common for one audience member to derail the speaker with a lot of questions. If this happens, simply respond:

## Audience microphone

Have an audience mic ready for audience interactions & questions.

* Always include and test the audience microphone **before** the session
* Make sure audience questions are audible to the presenter, the live attendees, and for recording/livestream purposes
* Encourage audience members to use the mic, and instruct presenters to **paraphrase or repeat the question** before answering—this ensures context and clarity for all audiences
