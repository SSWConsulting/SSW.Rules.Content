seoDescription: Create instant brand recognition by using logo motifs independently
  of your full company logo, leveraging symbols and elements that define your identity.
title: Do you use identifying company logo motifs?
type: rule
uri: do-you-use-identifying-company-logo-motifs
---

You can still create immediate brand recognition even when it's not applicable to use your full company logo. This can be achieved by taking symbols or motifs out of your main logo and using them in your branding material.

<endIntro />

For example, the SSW has 4 little coloured square as motifs within the logo, and these squares can be used without the rest of the logo text.
