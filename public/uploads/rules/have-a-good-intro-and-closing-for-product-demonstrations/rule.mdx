It is important to have solid **introduction** and **closing** statements. This is specially useful for product demonstrations.

**Closing:** _"Thanks for watching"_

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{

} } />

**Closing:** _"I’ve just demonstrated the usefulness of a project breakdown report to understand what it is your employees are working on"_
