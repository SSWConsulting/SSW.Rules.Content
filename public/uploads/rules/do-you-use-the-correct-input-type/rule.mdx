HTML 5 introduced a whole slew of new type properties for forms. Gone are the days of just using `type="text"` for every field in a form (barring buttons and checkboxes).

Although most of these don't do anything on desktop, on mobile devices they bring up the correct keyboard. As we move into a more mobile digital age, small things like the proper numerical keyboard or a keyboard with a quick ".com" becomes increasingly important.
