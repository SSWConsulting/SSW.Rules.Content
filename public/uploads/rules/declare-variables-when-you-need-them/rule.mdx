  body={<>
Should you declare variables at the top of the function, or declare them when you need to use them? If you come back to your code after a few weeks and you no longer need a variable, you are quite likely to forget to delete the declaration at the top, leaving orphaned variables. Here at SSW, we believe that variables should be declared as they are needed.
