It is important to regularly do a "Get Latest" to make sure you are using the most recent version of the code. In a team, if you go too long without doing a Get, you are more likely to encounter inconsistencies and will have to spend time merging your code.

<!--endintro-->

As part of your team process, you should make sure all developers are doing a Get Latest on a regular basis for each project they are working on. This is in line with [Do you Follow a Test Drive Process?](/before-starting-do-you-follow-a-test-driven-process) rule.

**Tip:** To find out when you or another developer last did a Get from TFS, you can use the Workspace Sidekick in [Team Foundation Sidekicks](http://www.attrice.info/cm/tfs/index.htm). If you're the TFS Master, you should do this every couple of weeks to make sure your team is regularly retrieving files from TFS.
