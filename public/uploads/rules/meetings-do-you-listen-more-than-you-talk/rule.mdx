For meetings with clients, aim for a ratio of 70% to 30% - that is, 70% of the time the customer should be talking. Remember the purpose of the meeting is to meet the client's needs. You can still convey your message to your clients by adding to **what they have to say**, rather than presenting a prepared speech to them.

It's important to ask probing questions and then listen to the answers.
