  body={<>
When an employee leaves or a domain account expires, disable the account, never delete it, as:

- Some LOB application such as CRM maintain a reference to the AD domain user GUID
- During the migration or restoration of CRM, users stored in the database are verified against AD and problems may occur if they no longer exist
