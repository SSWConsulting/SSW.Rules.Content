When users sort a table by clicking a column header, they need to immediately see which column is driving the sort order. Without clear visual indicators, users lose context - especially in data-heavy tables with many columns.

<endIntro />

There are 2 key visual cues to provide:

1. **Bold the active column header** - The sorted column header text should be bold (and optionally a darker color) so it stands out from unsorted headers
2. **Show sort direction** - Use an arrow icon (up/down) to indicate ascending or descending order. Unsorted columns can show a neutral up-down arrow to indicate they are sortable

### Why this matters

Users frequently sort tables and then scroll or scan the data. If the sorted column isn't visually distinct, they have to remember which column they clicked - or worse, they may not realize the data is sorted at all. Bold headers solve this with minimal visual noise.
