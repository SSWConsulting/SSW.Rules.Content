  body={<>
When the XML schema is published it re-generates the underlying SQL and .aspx code. If trouble hits, a "refresh" or "rollback" to an uncorrupted schema is always a backup plan. A versioning scheme is also required to keep track of different versions of the XML schema at different points in time. To make a backup of the schema from within Microsoft CRM navigate to Settings -&gt; Customization -&gt; Export Customizations. Browse to the location on your personal hard drive where the .XML file is to be stored.

**Tip #1:** Export only the customizations of entities that you customize and keep each entity customizations in a separate file, see the rule:[Customization](/customization-do-you-only-export-the-customizations-and-related-ones-that-you-have-made-only-for-crm-4-0) - Do you export only the customizations of entities that you did customize?

**Tip #2:** Put the date on the file names and while you are working you will be doing this multiple times a day.

**Tip #3:** don't save this on the Dev Virtual Machine.

In CRM 2011 we use Solutions and TFS Source Control.
