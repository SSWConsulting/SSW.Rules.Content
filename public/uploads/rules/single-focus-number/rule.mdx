  body={<>
Many reports are expanding on what could be expressed as a single number. When this is the case, make sure that number is clear and bold at the top right of the report.

Ideally this should be a single number, not a group of numbers. If there is more than one, make sure one is chosen as the main one and put the others in a less prominent colour, size, or position.

An even better option is to show this number as a KPI, which shows historical values for that number in the background, and potentially a target. this gives contextto whether the number you're seeing is a "good" or "bad".
