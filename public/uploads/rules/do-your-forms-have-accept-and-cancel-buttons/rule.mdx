If you have a button in a form you must have an accept or a cancel button. As a result user can use "Enter" and "Esc" to control the form.

We have a program called [SSW CodeAuditor](https://ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/Rules.aspx#ANCBTN) to check for this rule.

**Note:** The CodeAuditor Rule will just test the buttons on the Base form and ignore all the inherit forms, because for more reusable code, the Accept and Cancel buttons should be in the base form.
