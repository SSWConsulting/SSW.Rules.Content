Engaging and interacting with your audience is great a way to get more "activities" around your videos and channel as well as building a faithful audience.

<endIntro />

Make sure you:

* Invite your viewers to comment on your video but give them something specific to comment on. Avoid “leave a comment below if you enjoyed the video” and ask them an open-ended question ("what is your favorite cake? Do you have any other tips to share?")
* Reply to your viewers’ comments. It is a great idea so they know they can touch base with you and they are likely to come back to discuss further, generating more traffic. More people will also be tempted to comment if they see an interaction between you and your viewers

There are also some other little “tricks” to keep your audience happy:

* In your video analytics, monitor your retention rate to see what worked well so you can do it again (basically, check what your audience likes)
* Be (pro)active and share your video on other media (forums, social media...)
* Creating a 60 second-long video preview (with the same title) with a link to the full YouTube video written in a comment is a good way to promote it on Facebook
* Use emotional keywords in your title and description. Use the [Advanced Marketing Institute website](https://aminstitute.com/headline), check your keywords and keep those with a result of at least 25% (the higher the result the better)
* Reach the largest audience by posting at the best time: between 12 pm and 4 pm on weekdays (ideally on Thursdays) and between 9 am and 11 am on weekend (ideally on Saturdays)
