<introEmbed
  body={<>
Years ago, it was common to have the "language" attribute within the script tags. This attribute was used to specify the scripting language of the contents of this element.
  </>}
/>
Since these identifiers are not standard, this attribute has been deprecated in favor of "type".

```html
<script href="script.js" language="javascript"></script>
```
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Figure: Bad example - Language attribute has been deprecated",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


```html
<script href="script.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "Figure: Good example - The scripting language is specified as a content type",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />
