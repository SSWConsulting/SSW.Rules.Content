Specification Reviews can be a long process and not having access to the relevant parties that hold the vision and the budget can create obstacles.

Critical stakeholders are people with a sound understanding of the business requirements and control over the budget. These stakeholders are rarely technical.

When organizing the Spec Review, clearly communicate the importance of stakeholder attendance. There's no point in conducting a Spec Review without the critical stakeholders who ensure that business requirements are accurately recorded.

Make sure the stakeholders are aware of what is needed ahead of time. If all relevant stakeholders aren't available, be sure to warn that this will cause issues down the line. Remember, if no one in the Spec Review holds both the budget and vision, the product that you write up will look a lot different from what the business needs.
