**Question:** What is wrong with this Picture?


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "What is wrong?",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/control-choice-do-you-have-a-consistent-look-on-your-buttons-windows-forms-only/../../assets/InconsistentButtonStyles.jpg"
/>
  </>}
/>
**Answer:** There are three different types of buttons in the Application:

- _Next &gt;_ - Default Window Style
- _Preview_ - .NET Flat Style
- _Cancel_ - Window XP Style


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Even labels need to use FlatStyle.System. Can you spot the wrong label?",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/control-choice-do-you-have-a-consistent-look-on-your-buttons-windows-forms-only/../../assets/BadDivider.gif"
/>
