#### Icon

Including an icon is important because not only does it give the user a visual indication of the type of message, but without it only the Default beep sound is used. The icon should reflect the type of information being presented:

<endIntro />

| Icon                                 | Name                           | When to use                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![info](/uploads/rules/messages-do-you-know-what-icons-to-use-3-3-icons/Info.gif)       | **MessageBoxIcon.Information** | Non-error information, e.g. Database connection test completed successfully |
| ![Warning](/uploads/rules/messages-do-you-know-what-icons-to-use-3-3-icons/Warning.gif) | **MessageBoxIcon.Warning**     | A non-critical error, e.g. The input was invalid                            |
| ![error](/uploads/rules/messages-do-you-know-what-icons-to-use-3-3-icons/Error.gif)     | **MessageBoxIcon.Error**       | Critical error in the program, e.g. Program file was not found              |
| ![](/uploads/rules/messages-do-you-know-what-icons-to-use-3-3-icons/Question.gif)       | **MessageBoxIcon.Question**    | **NEVER** use this.                                                         |

According to Microsoft, the Question mark is being phased out, as any of the other three: Error, Warning or Information can easily be reworded into a Question, and Question does not show the user the severity of the issue that has just occurred.
E.g. If you want to ask the user whether they want to save a file before closing, you should use the Warning Icon. |

We have a program called [SSW Code](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/Rules.aspx#TitleVB)Auditorto check for this rule.
