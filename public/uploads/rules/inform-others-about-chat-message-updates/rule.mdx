When updating an existing message in IM chats, others might see an indication of it, but won't get a notification, so it's important to inform them about your message changes.

This simple practice promotes transparency, avoids confusion, and ensures everyone has the most current information. By keeping everyone in the loop, you foster clearer communication and enhance collaboration within the team.

    **Note:** It's **not** necessary to notify others if:

* You're simply fixing a typo or making a minor edit that won't alter the meaning of your message
* The other person hasn't read the message yet
