  your database for duplicate detection.

There comes a time when some contacts in your CRM database might just be taking up space and not giving any value. At this point it is best to deactivate them.

<endIntro />

- CRM still knows about it so it will still come up for duplicate detection.
- You can still view them if you need to by viewing Inactive companies/contacts.

**Hint:** When you deactivate a client - put a note in the notes field to say why first.
