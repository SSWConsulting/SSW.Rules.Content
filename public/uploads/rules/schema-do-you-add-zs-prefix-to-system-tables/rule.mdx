seoDescription: Schema guidelines suggest adding a "zs" prefix to system tables not
  containing application data for uniformity and organization.

<introEmbed
  body={<>
Any type of table in a database where that does not contain application data should be called zs. So when the other application (e.g. SSW SQL Deploy) or the programmer populates the table then it should be called zs (e.g. zsDate - the program populates it, zsVersion - the programmer populates it).
