Writing CSS is easy. Writing a lot of CSS can become unwieldy and unmanageable. Using CSS pre-processors like LESS or SCSS helps you segment and organize your CSS logically and compiles down to regular CSS so there are extra steps to get up and running.
  </>}
/>
The key advantage of using CSS pre-processors is nested selectors. Instead line after line of specific CSS selectors you can nest them and they will compile down for you. Check out this example:

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: '![Bad Example: Using regular CSS, you repeat yourself a lot](/uploads/rules/do-you-always-use-less-instead-of-plain-old-css/RulesLESS - css.png)',
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: '![Good Example: Using LESS, we can structure our CSS better](/uploads/rules/do-you-always-use-less-instead-of-plain-old-css/RulesLESS - less.png)',
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


The pre-processed CSS then compiles to the regular CSS shown above.

We recommend using SCSS for its slightly more robust language scripting, however, the [differences between LESS and SCSS are minor](https://css-tricks.com/sass-vs-less/).
