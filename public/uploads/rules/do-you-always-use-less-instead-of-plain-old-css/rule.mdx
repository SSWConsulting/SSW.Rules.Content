Writing CSS is easy. Writing a lot of CSS can become unwieldy and unmanageable. Using CSS pre-processors like LESS or SCSS helps you segment and organize your CSS logically and compiles down to regular CSS so there are extra steps to get up and running.

<endOfIntro />

The key advantage of using CSS pre-processors is nested selectors. Instead line after line of specific CSS selectors you can nest them and they will compile down for you. Check out this example:

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePreset="badExample"
  figureText={"Bad Example: Using regular CSS, you repeat yourself a lot"}
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-always-use-less-instead-of-plain-old-css/RulesLESS - css.png"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePreset="goodExample"
  figureText={"Good Example: Using LESS, we can structure our CSS better"}
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-always-use-less-instead-of-plain-old-css/RulesLESS - less.png"
/>


The pre-processed CSS then compiles to the regular CSS shown above.

We recommend using SCSS for its slightly more robust language scripting, however, the [differences between LESS and SCSS are minor](https://css-tricks.com/sass-vs-less/).
