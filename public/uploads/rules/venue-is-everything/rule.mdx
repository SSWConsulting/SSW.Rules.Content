This cannot be stressed enough. The venue for your event is the absolute most important item to get right and to get locked in.

<endIntro />

An ideal venue should be addressing all of the following

- Be able to accommodate the desired amount of people
- Offer appropriate audio and visual equipment for the talks, such as microphones, projectors and power sources
- Is there Wi-Fi available? If not, what is your backup plan (if any)
- Be within budgetary constraints (see rule "Have you got an adequate budget")

Securing the venue as early as possible on the right date allows you to

- Book in speakers – They can lock in the engagement
- Announce the venue
- Determine capacity – You now know how many attendees you can accommodate
- Start promoting the event
- Determine what approximate budget is needed
