Following these simple rules makes this really easy:

* Put your preferred navigation in the same place (usually on the left-hand side)
* Keep the headings consistent
* Use icons for each type of link, so users easily know what to expect when clicking on a link (E.g. A Microsoft Word document is going to open a Word document) Aldo, a link to "Home" looks the same on every page.

## Navigation consistency between pages

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: "Bad example - The page on the left has totally different navigation to the page on the right",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/consistent-sharepoint-sites/inconsistent1.png"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good example - Both pages looking consistent - common navigation elements in the same spot",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/consistent-sharepoint-sites/consistent.png"
/>


## Headings and icons consistency within a page

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: "Bad example - There are no icons to help users on the left navigation + the headings are the different",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/consistent-sharepoint-sites/inconsistent2.png"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good example - Icons help users to know what files each link open on the left navigation + the headings are the same",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/consistent-sharepoint-sites/navigation-with-webpart_1710232021932.png"
