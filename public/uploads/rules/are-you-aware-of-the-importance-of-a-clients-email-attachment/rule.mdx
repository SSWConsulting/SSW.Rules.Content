Sometimes clients will add attachment files into emails. Those files could be documents or images, which may contain details or solutions of the issue, or some helpful information.

To keep the history, it is very important to keep the attachment files into the email since it's easy to lose those files when responding.

In case the file is an image, you should insert it to the body of the email to make the history even more clear.

**Note:** Some clients make attachments because they are using OWA and you can't paste an image in.
