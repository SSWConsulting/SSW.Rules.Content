Poorly structured pages confuse search engines and frustrate users. Missing page titles, multiple H1s, or images without ALT text create unnecessary barriers to ranking and reduce click-through rates (CTR), even when the content itself is strong. Following strict structural best practices ensures your pages are easy to understand, accessible, and optimised for search.

### Page Titles & Meta Descriptions

Page titles and meta descriptions are often the first interaction users have with your content in search results. If they are missing, too long, or unclear, users are far less likely to click.

#### Best practices:

* Keep page titles between 30–60 characters
* Keep meta descriptions under 155 characters
* Titles must clearly reflect the primary keyword or topic
* Meta descriptions should highlight a unique selling proposition (USP) and include a clear call-to-action (CTA)

### Header Tags

Header tags define the structure of your content. When used incorrectly, they dilute topic clarity and make it harder for search engines and users to understand the page.

#### Best practices:

* Every page must have exactly one unique H1 
* The H1 must clearly define the main topic 
* Use H2s to structure subtopics, not as repeated labels 
* Avoid duplicate H2s; each should add meaning and hierarchy 

### Image Optimisation with ALT Text 

Search engines cannot see images; they rely on ALT text to understand what an image represents. Missing or generic ALT tags reduce accessibility and eliminate opportunities for image-based search visibility.

#### Best practices:

* Every image must have an ALT tag
* ALT text should be concise, descriptive, and relevant to the image content and page topic
* Avoid keyword stuffing; focus on clarity

### Summary

Strict structural SEO practices are not optional. Clear page titles, well-defined headers, and properly optimized images help search engines understand your content and give users a compelling reason to click. When every page follows these rules, rankings and CTR improve naturally.
