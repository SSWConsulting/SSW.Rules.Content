Poorly structured pages confuse search engines and frustrate users. Missing page titles, multiple H1s, or images without ALT text create unnecessary barriers to ranking and reduce click-through rates (CTR), even when the content itself is strong. Following strict structural best practices ensures your pages are easy to understand, accessible, and optimised for search.

### Page Titles & Meta Descriptions

Page titles and meta descriptions are often the first interaction users have with your content in search results. If they are missing, too long, or unclear, users are far less likely to click.

#### Best practices:

* Keep page titles between 30–60 characters
* Keep meta descriptions under 155 characters
* Titles must clearly reflect the primary keyword or topic
* Meta descriptions should highlight a unique selling proposition (USP) and include a clear call-to-action (CTA)
