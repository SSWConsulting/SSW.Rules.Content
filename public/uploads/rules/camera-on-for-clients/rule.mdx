When working with clients, inevitably you'll find yourself in Teams calls, and it's important to keep your front-facing camera on as much as possible. There's a lot of valuable information conveyed by your face and body language.

* Facial expression and body language are important parts of communication, and help to convey your mood and intent
* It's more friendly towards the other people in a call if they can see you as well as hear you. It feels a lot better to talk to a **person** than it does to a blank profile image
* It also makes you more trustworthy. People are much more likely to listen and believe you if they can actually see you

    figure: "Bad example - The client feels like they are talking to a blank screen. Even with a profile picture, it feels impersonal",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }

    figure: "Good example - The client can see your face, and the call feels much more relaxed and personal",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }

Of course there are exceptions, and there are times when you should definitely not turn your camera on.

* If you need to eat during a meeting, it's a good idea to turn video off
* If someone is having network problems, often turning off video helps
