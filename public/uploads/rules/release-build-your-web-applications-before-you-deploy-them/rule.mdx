seoDescription: Release build your web applications before deployment to optimize
  performance and security with ASP.NET by compiling all files into one DLL and disabling
  resource caching.

Reasons to release build your web applications before you deploy them with ASP.NET:

* ASP.NET conducts a batch compilation on "release builds", which means it tries to compile all files in the current folder into one DLL
* No resource caching is performed on debug build assemblies, which means that each request/response for a resource is not cached

According to [MSDN web developer tips](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com?WT.mc_id=DOP-MVP-33518), you can choose one of the following to release build your web application:

* In web.config file, set &lt;compilation debug="false"/&gt;
* Disable the &lt;compilation debug="true"/&gt; switch for all ASP.NET applications on the server by setting the following in Machine.config

<endOfIntro />

```xml
<system.web>
    <deployment retail="true"/>
</system.web>
```
**✅ The setting in machine.config will also turn off trace output in a page and detailed error messages remotely**  

Machine.config file is typically located at `%SystemRoot%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\%VersionNumber%\CONFIG`.
