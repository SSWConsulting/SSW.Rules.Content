Don't let your client find bugs in production that they would have found if you had asked them to do a 'Test Please' 1st
Better still... Don't let your client find bugs that your internal tester would have found.
Better still... Don't let your tester find bugs that a tool could have found?

So, prior to a version being submitted to the client, these are the 4 steps you should follow:

1. Perform automated testing with tools:

   - SSW Link Auditor (for Web Apps)

   - SSW Code Auditor (for all Apps)

   - SSW SQL Auditor (for all Apps with databases)

   - SSW SQL Deploy's Reconcile (for all Apps with databases)

   - Visual Studio Team System Code Analysis (optional)

2. Perform automated testing via Unit Tests

   - xUnit, or

   - nUnit

3. Perform an internal "Test Please" (aka "Alpha Testing" e.g. only testing that pages or forms load, not checking the business rules)
4. Then send a "Test Please" to the client (aka "Acceptance Testing" to check the business rules)
