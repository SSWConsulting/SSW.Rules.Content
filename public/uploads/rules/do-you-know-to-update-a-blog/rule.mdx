When you update your blog post, use the word "UPDATED" clearly (in capitals and in red for example). The date should also be added, if relevant.

<endOfIntro />

Example:


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    UPDATED: 1 August 2010 [summary of what you changed]
  </>}
  captionStyle="default"
  captionText={""}
/>



<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  captionStyle="default"
  captionText={"OK example – Although Peter has the right idea, he needs to think more of a global audience -        See live"}
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-to-update-a-blog/RulesBloggingUpdate_OKPeter.jpg"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  captionStyle="goodExample"
  captionText={"Ultimate example – Mike has gotten into the swing of things -        See live"}
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-to-update-a-blog/RulesBloggingUpdate_UltimateMike.jpg"
/>


You should also apply this technique to youtube videos you record too.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  captionStyle="goodExample"
  captionText={"Good Example - Following up on bug video makes it clear that the bug was fixed quickly"}
