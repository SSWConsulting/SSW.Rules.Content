Example:


<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    UPDATED: 1 August 2010 [summary of what you changed]
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>



<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "OK example – Although Peter has the right idea, he needs to think more of a global audience -        See live",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }

  } }

    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good Example - Following up on bug video makes it clear that the bug was fixed quickly",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
