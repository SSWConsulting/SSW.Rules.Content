When you need to create a new line in your string, make sure you use Environment.NewLine, and then literally begin typing your code on a new line for readability purposes.

```csharp
string strExample = "This is a very long string that is \r\n not properly implementing a new line.";

```csharp
string strExample = "This is a very long string that is " + Environment.NewLine +
		 " properly implementing a new line.";

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{

```csharp
varÂ example = new StringBuilder();

```

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{
