When you need to create a new line in your string, make sure you use Environment.NewLine, and then literally begin typing your code on a new line for readability purposes.

<endIntro />

```csharp
string strExample = "This is a very long string that is \r\n not properly implementing a new line.";
```
**❌ Bad example - The string has implemented a manual carriage return line feed pair `\r\n`**  

```csharp
string strExample = "This is a very long string that is " + Environment.NewLine +
		 " properly implementing a new line.";
```
**✅ OK example - The new line is created with Enviroment.NewLine (but strings are immutable)**  

```csharp
var example = new StringBuilder();

example.AppendLine("This is a very long string that is ");

example.Append(" properly implementing a new line.");
```
**✅ Good example - The new line is created by the StringBuilder and has better memory utilisation**
