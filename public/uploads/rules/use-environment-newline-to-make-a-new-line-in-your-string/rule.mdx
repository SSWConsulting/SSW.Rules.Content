When you need to create a new line in your string, make sure you use Environment.NewLine, and then literally begin typing your code on a new line for readability purposes.

<endOfIntro />

```csharp
string strExample = "This is a very long string that is \r\n not properly implementing a new line.";
```
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Bad example - The string has implemented a manual carriage return line feed pair `\\r\\n`",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


```csharp
string strExample = "This is a very long string that is " + Environment.NewLine +
		 " properly implementing a new line.";
```
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "OK example - The new line is created with Enviroment.NewLine (but strings are immutable)",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


```csharp
var example = new StringBuilder();

example.AppendLine("This is a very long string that is ");

example.Append(" properly implementing a new line.");
```
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "Good example - The new line is created by the StringBuilder and has better memory utilisation",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />
