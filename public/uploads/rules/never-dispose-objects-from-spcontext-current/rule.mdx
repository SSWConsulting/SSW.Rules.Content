Disposing objects in SharePoint is important, but never do it with objects from `SPContext.Current`. SharePoint will manage disposing these objects itself.

```csharp
using (SPWeb web =  SPContext.Current.Site.RootWeb)
{
    //do something here
}
```

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: 'Figure: Using statement is trying to dispose current site object - it will cause exception',
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


Just simply use "Current" object directly.

```csharp
SPWeb web =Â  SPContext.Current.Site.RootWeb;
//do something here
```

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: 'Figure: Use Current objects directly - don\'t need to dispose them',
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />

  </>}
/>
