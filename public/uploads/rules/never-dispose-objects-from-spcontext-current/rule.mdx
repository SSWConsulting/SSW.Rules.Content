  body={<>
Disposing objects in SharePoint is important, but never do it with objects from `SPContext.Current`. SharePoint will manage disposing these objects itself.
  </>}
/>
```csharp
using (SPWeb web =  SPContext.Current.Site.RootWeb)
{
    //do something here
}
```
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Figure: Bad example - Using statement is trying to dispose current site object - it will cause exception",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


Just simply use "Current" object directly.

```csharp
SPWeb web =  SPContext.Current.Site.RootWeb;
//do something here
```
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "Figure: Good example - Use Current objects directly - don't need to dispose them",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />
