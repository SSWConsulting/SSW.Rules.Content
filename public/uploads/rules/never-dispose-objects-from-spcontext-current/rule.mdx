Disposing objects in SharePoint is important, but never do it with objects from `SPContext.Current`. SharePoint will manage disposing these objects itself.

<endIntro />

```csharp
using (SPWeb web =  SPContext.Current.Site.RootWeb)
{
    //do something here
}
```
**❌ Figure: Bad example - Using statement is trying to dispose current site object - it will cause exception**  

Just simply use "Current" object directly.

```csharp
SPWeb web =  SPContext.Current.Site.RootWeb;
//do something here
```
**✅ Figure: Good example - Use Current objects directly - don't need to dispose them**
