seoDescription: Report page headers should be concise and contain as little content
  as possible to avoid duplication on every page. This approach helps save paper when
  printing and keeps the report organized.
title: Layout - Do you put as little content as possible in a report page header?
type: rule
uri: least-content-in-page-header
---

Things in a report page header repeat on every page. To avoid duplicate and save paper when printing, we put content as less as possible in the header.
