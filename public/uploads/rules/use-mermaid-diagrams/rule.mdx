When your product owner asks for an architecture Diagram on your project choosing the right software can easily lead to decision paralysis. Mermaid diagrams give you a convenient text based editing format and can easily be tweaked, changed, and maintained without using proprietary software.

## What is Mermaid?

Mermaid is a Javascript, node based charting tool inspired by markdown. It's supported by a number of Markdown parsing engines like [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams), and [TinaCMS](https://tina.io/blog/mermaid-tina-progress).

## Why Mermaid excels for collaboration

Visual tools like Draw\.io or Excalidraw are excellent for white boarding and quick brainstorming. However, they start to fall down when diagrams need to be:

* Maintained over time
* Reviewed in pull requests
* Kept in sync with code

## When to use Mermaid

* **Documentation sites** - Because Mermaid diagrams can be stored in Markdown it's good to use them on for documentation pages that are updated frequently.
* **GitHub** - Mermaid diagrams are supported by [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams), meaning they can be embedded in Issues, Pull requests, comments, and documentation.

See [Do you have an architecture diagram?](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/architecture-diagram) for more information on tools for creating architecture diagrams.

Some other choices you have:

* Draw\.io
* Excalidraw
* Miro
* Diagrams.net
* Visio
* Lucid chart

## AI-friendly

Because mermaid diagrams are text based, they can quickly be churned by AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude Desktop, making it quicker and easier to draft changes.
