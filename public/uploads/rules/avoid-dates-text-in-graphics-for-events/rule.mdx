To maximize reusability and minimize costs, it’s best to avoid including dates as text in graphics for promotional videos.

<endOfIntro />

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePreset="badExample"
  figureText={"Bad example - Dates shown as text in graphics (creates extra work to change every time)"}
  src="/uploads/rules/avoid-dates-text-in-graphics-for-events/events-dates-bad.png"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePreset="goodExample"
  figureText={"Good example - No dates shown as text in graphics (can be re-used without editing)"}
  src="/uploads/rules/avoid-dates-text-in-graphics-for-events/events-dates-good.png"
/>


If there is some particular value/purpose in including dates there may be exceptions to this rule.
