To maximize reusability and minimize costs, it’s best to avoid including dates as text in graphics for promotional videos.

    preset: "badExample",
    figure: 'Bad example - Dates shown as text in graphics (creates extra work to change every time)',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}

  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: 'Good example - No dates shown as text in graphics (can be re-used without editing)',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}

If there is some particular value/purpose in including dates there may be exceptions to this rule.
