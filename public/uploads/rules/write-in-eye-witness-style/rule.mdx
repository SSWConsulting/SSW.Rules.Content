Web content should be written in 3rd person language, as if read by a newsreader. It is objective and describes its content professionally. A good example of this is Wikipedia.

### Quotes

When quoting a testimonial, it is OK to use 1st person writing. Of course, the sentence should be in quotes. Think of it like a newsreader crossing over to an eyewitness for a personal view of the topic.
