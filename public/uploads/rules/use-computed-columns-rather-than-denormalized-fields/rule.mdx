When you have a denormalized field, use a computed column. In SQL Server they can be persisted.

Use the suffix "Computed" to clearly distinguish that this field is a computed field.

  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: "Bad Example - This field was manually updated from code in the middle tier.",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/use-computed-columns-rather-than-denormalized-fields/NormalizedFields_Bad.jpg"
/>

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good Example - There was no code in the middle tier to calculate this (and it has the correct name)",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/use-computed-columns-rather-than-denormalized-fields/NormalizedFields_Good.jpg"
/>
  </>}
/>
Computed columns have some limitations - they cannot access fields in other tables, or other computed fields in the current table.

You can use user-defined functions (UDF) from code in a reusable function, this allows one computed column to use a function to call another function. Here is an example:

```sql
ALTER FUNCTION [dbo].[udfEmpTime_TimeTotalComputed]
(
@TimeStart as DateTime,
@TimeEnd as DateTime

)
RETURNS DECIMAL(8,6)
AS
BEGIN
-- This function returns the time difference in hours - decimal(8,6)
RETURN (round(isnull(CONVERT([decimal](8,6),@TimeEnd - @TimeStart,(0))*(24),(0)),(2)))

 END
```

**Figure: This is the user defined function**

  } }
