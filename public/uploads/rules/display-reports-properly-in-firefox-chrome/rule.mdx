Sometimes users try to view SQL Server Reports in Firefox or Chrome Browser, it does not display at all or displays in a half screen.

<endOfIntro />

They found it strange when the same report works absolutely fine in Internet Explorer.

The Solution:

Add the code below to "%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.3\ReportingServices\ReportManager\Styles\ReportingServevices.css"

```sql
 .DocMapAndReportFrame
 {
 min-height: 860px;
 min-width: 2000px;
 }
```
