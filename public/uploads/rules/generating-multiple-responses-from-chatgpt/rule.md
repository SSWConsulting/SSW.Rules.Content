Here are some tips for using prompts to generate multiple outputs:

- Experiment with different prompt variations to elicit a range of responses
- Use settings like temperature and max tokens to control the randomness and length of the generated responses
- Evaluate the generated responses based on relevance, accuracy, and usefulness for your specific use case
- If none of the responses are satisfactory, consider refining your prompt and trying again
