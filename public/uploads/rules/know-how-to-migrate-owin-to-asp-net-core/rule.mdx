OWIN is the [Open Web Interface for .NET](http://owin.org/), which was intended to provide a standard interface between .NET web servers and web applications for ASP.NET. It provided the ability to chain middleware together to form pipelines and to register modules.

The [Katana libraries](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetKatana/) provided a flexible set of popular components for OWIN-based web applications. These components were supplied through packages prefixed with `Microsoft.Owin`.

Middleware and module registering functionality are now core features of ASP.NET Core. Microsoft provides adapters to and from the [OWIN interface for ASP.NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/owin?view=aspnetcore-10.0\&WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-33518) that can be used to gradually migrate custom OWIN components. By contrast, ASP.NET Core has native ports for Katana components.

<endIntro />

## Using adapters for incremental migration

If you need to move gradually, ASP.NET Core can interoperate with OWIN using the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Owin` adapters. This lets you run OWIN middleware inside the ASP.NET Core pipeline while you migrate pieces over.

Important tradeoffs:

* Adapters have a performance cost and should be treated as a **temporary** measure.
* Group OWIN components together (multiple `UseOwin` calls are discouraged).

See: [Running OWIN middleware in the ASP.NET Core pipeline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/owin?view=aspnetcore-10.0)

## CORS functionality

CORS functionality was enabled in OWIN with the `UseCors(...)` extension method. In ASP.NET Core, CORS is built-in (via `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Cors`) and is typically configured with `AddCors(...)` and applied with [UseCors(...)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/cors?view=aspnetcore-10.0).

```cs
public void Configuration(Owin.IAppBuilder app) {
    // ... other logic ...
    app.UseCors(getCorsOption());
    // ... other logic ...
}

private static CorsOptions BuildCorsOptions() {
    var corsPolicy = new CorsPolicy
    {
        AllowAnyMethod = true,
        AllowAnyHeader = true,
        SupportsCredentials = true
    };
    corsPolicy.Origins.Add("https://staging.northwind.com");
    return new CorsOptions
    {
        PolicyProvider = new CorsPolicyProvider
        {
            PolicyResolver = context => Task.FromResult(corsPolicy)
        }
    };
}
```

**❌ Figure: Basic OWIN CORS example.**

```cs
const string stagingCorsPolicyName = "StagingOnly";
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddCors(options =>
{
  options.AddPolicy(stagingCorsPolicyName, corsPolicyBuilder =>
    corsPolicyBuilder.WithOrigins("https://staging.northwind.com")
             .AllowAnyMethod()
             .AllowAnyHeader()
             .AllowCredentials());
});

var app = builder.Build();

app.UseCors(stagingCorsPolicyName);

app.Run();
```

## Third-Party Authentication

A common use for OWIN was to provide access to [third-party authentication sources](/choosing-authentication/). [AspNet.Security.OAuth.Providers](https://github.com/aspnet-contrib/AspNet.Security.OAuth.Providers) is a collection of security middleware that works natively in ASP.NET Core to support authentication sources such as GitHub and Azure DevOps. See the [full list of providers](https://github.com/aspnet-contrib/AspNet.Security.OAuth.Providers#providers), and the details of the migration differ from one provider to another.
