The number you give to a client says a lot about how much room there is to move. Knowing the difference and when to use them can be a valuable tool in securing projects.
  </>}
/>
## Fixed Price Projects

For a **fixed price** project, exact figures should be used. This makes sure there is no ambiguity between what the client is thinking and what you are thinking.

A round figure gives the impression that it was just plucked out of thin air and you can go lower.

**Note:** Whether round or exact, [make sure your dollar amount is excluding GST, and has "+GST" after it](/do-you-always-quote-price-plus-gst-tax).


<asideEmbed

  body={<>
    The project will take about 6 months to complete and cost $200,000+GST
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Bad Example - You've just made that number up, you can go lower",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


An exact figure gives the impression that you've done your research and there isn't as much room to move.


<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    The project will take 6 months to complete and cost $204,080+GST
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "Good Example - Everyone knows exactly what they're in for",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


## Time and Materials Projects

For a **variable price** project, round figures should be used. This gives room for the project scope to be varied with additional items and lends itself more to an agile approach.


<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    The project will take 6 months to complete and cost $204,080+GST
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Bad Example - This makes it very hard to vary the project as the client will always have this figure in mind",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


A round figure gives the impression that this is a ball park estimate and that the price will likely change.


<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    The project will take about 6 months to complete and cost approximately $200K+GST
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "Good Example - Give the client an indication of how much it will approximately cost without committing to the figure",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />
