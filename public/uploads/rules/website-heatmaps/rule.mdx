The user experience on your site is crucial to ensuring that you are effectively converting your leads into clients, but what if this isn’t happening?

How can you work out where your site is going wrong and why? One key way to track how users are viewing your site is **heatmapping**, which tracks the behaviour of your users on your site through mouse tracking and eye tracking techniques.

This information allows you to determine areas of our site are performing efficiently and areas we need to adjust for better performance.

## Tools

Most heatmapping tools are very similar for the main features. It mostly comes down to how much you want to pay and which user interface you prefer.
