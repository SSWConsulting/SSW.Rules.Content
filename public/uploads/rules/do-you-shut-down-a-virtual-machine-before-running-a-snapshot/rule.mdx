Snapshots are a very easy way to back up a system before a big change is made. They can also be easily restored if something goes wrong during the change.

<!--endintro-->

1. In the **Hyper-V Manager** , ensure the Virtual Machine has the state of **Off**
2. Right click on the virtual machine you wish to snapshot and click **Snapshot**
3. The snapshot should run very quickly and you will notice the snapshot in the **Snapshots** area of the \*\*Hyper-V Manager
