- a search page. This page [ssw/Kb/KBSearch.asp](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/KB/KBSearch.aspx) is for searching a table obviously called KB
- a search results page. This page [ssw/KB/KBResult.aspx?searchOn=Words&searchFor=problem](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/KB/KBResult.aspx?searchOn=Words&searchFor=problem) is returning the records for a table called KB
- a detail page. This page is showing the detail record for a record in the table 'KB'
