Here’s a little thing to keep in mind, as Google Ads has a limitation in characters. The Ads character limits are as follows:

<!--endintro-->

* **Headline 1** – 30 Character Maximum
* **Headline 2** – 30 Character Maximum
* **Description Line** – 90 Character Maximum
* **Display URL** – 35 Character Maximum
* **Final URL** – 1024 Character Maximum

Main Key metrics to follow (depending on your strategy):

* CPC
* CPA
* CTR
* Average position
