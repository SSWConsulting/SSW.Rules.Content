seoDescription: Booking your next Sprint ahead of time ensures availability and prevents
  developers from being assigned to other projects
title: Agreements - Do you book the next Sprint ahead of time?
type: rule
uri: agreements-do-you-book-the-next-sprint-ahead-of-time
---

Unless we're currently working on the last Sprint of the development, you should always book the next Sprint as soon as you start work on the current one.

<endIntro />

This is done during the [Planning meeting](/what-happens-at-a-sprint-planning-meeting) and will ensure the availability of the developers who are up to speed on your project and stop them from being booked onto something else.
