Microservice architectures consist of a number of components
  </>}
/>
These often include:

- An API Gateway (think APIM, Ocelot, YARP, Azure Front Door)
- Support different types of frontends: Web, Desktop, Mobile
- Flexible deployment model in subsequent microservices
- Each microservice is in charge of its own data store
- Event driven
- VNet integration
- Messaging system (used to decouple services, think Azure SendGrid or ServiceBus)
