  body={<>
Please don't say just 'Hello' in chat. It's as if you called someone on the phone and said "Hi!" and then put them on hold!

When you do that, you're simply making the other person wait for you to phrase your question, which generates low productivity.
  </>}
/>
Now that you've avoided just saying hello, if you're calling them, [just be sure to give them a warning](/warn-then-call)

    **Shorter Video (1 min):** [Adam Cogan talks about a common mistake on IM - just saying "Hey" or "Hello" without explaining the context](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omuzBQaPQjw).

The same goes for:


<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    "Hey, are you there?"

--Waits for response before continuing--
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Bad example - Left waiting for a response",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />



<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    "Hi Bob, do you have a sec?"
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Bad example - No context",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />



<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    "Ping"
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Bad example - They're left waiting for you to ask a question",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


Instead of doing this, just ask the question!


<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    "Hey, are you happy for me to publish the CTF Form?"
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "Good example - You have given immediate context",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />
