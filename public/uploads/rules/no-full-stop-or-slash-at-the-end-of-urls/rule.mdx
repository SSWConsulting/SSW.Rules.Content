Including a full stop or slash at the end of a URL does not necessarily make it invalid or non-functional. However, it's worth noting that different web servers and applications may interpret URLs differently, and some implementations might treat a full stop or slash at the end differently or consider it as part of the URL.
In general, it is good practice to avoid including unnecessary characters at the end of URLs to ensure compatibility across different systems and prevent any potential confusion or misinterpretation.

It's recommended to follow the standard URL conventions and structure URLs without trailing periods or slashes unless they serve a specific purpose or are required for a particular system or application.
