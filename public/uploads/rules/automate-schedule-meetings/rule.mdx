We've all been part of that email chain... _"Let's meet to discuss this"_, _"When are you free?"_, _"I can do Friday"_, _"Friday's no good, what about Monday?"_, _"I'm free in the morning"_, _"Penny can't make that, how about Tuesday afternoon after 3?"_, etc.

AI can make scheduling meetings with multiple attendees much easier.

**Note:** The following solutions work best when you're dealing with people in your own organization, as they then have access to all calendar data, but with a bit of back and forth, they can still work for externals too. There are some options.

## Scheduling Poll in Microsoft Outlook 365

You can do complex scheduling tasks and calendar polls with this built-in Outlook 365 feature.

## FindTime

This option is best if you want to be selective about a few options for when to meet, and send a poll to attendees to choose.

FindTime shows what days and times work the best for you and the attendees when available using free/busy data.

Propose your selected times to all attendees and allow everyone to vote and quickly come to a consensus... and you’re done!

FindTime sends out the meeting invite on your behalf. More on [https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/install-findtime-2501ff38-0a47-4dc5-999f-bcca329f0f63](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/install-findtime-2501ff38-0a47-4dc5-999f-bcca329f0f63)

**Note:** Findtime’s competitor is [https://calendly.com](https://calendly.com)
