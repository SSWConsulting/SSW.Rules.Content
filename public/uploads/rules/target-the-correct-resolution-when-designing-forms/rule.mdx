You will target your application towards resolutions that your customers can use comfortably. It is no good to just tell the customer to increase their resolution on their 15-inch LCD  because your application and others can become unreadable on smaller screens.

See [this rule](/do-you-design-your-web-pages-to-work-on-mobile-tablets-screens-aka-responsive-web-design) for a guide as to which resolutions you will be targeting.
