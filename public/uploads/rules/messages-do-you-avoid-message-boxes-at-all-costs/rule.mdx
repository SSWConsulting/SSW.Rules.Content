Now, if you can't get rid of message boxes; try again.

There is nothing quite as annoying as persistent pop up message boxes, demanding your attention. Imagine you are working on a train, you are in between two fat people and your elbows are tucked in. Not only that the trackpad barely works and the user does not know that [spacebar] works on a message box.

Now think of that scenario every time you give a user a message box.

Exception: Only use them in the following scenarios:

- Confirming the deletion of a record
- Kicking off a long running process that cannot be cancelled
