It's important to always add the address information in appointments when a third party is included. Example:

* A client meeting at your location
* A meeting at the client location

The exception is for internal meeting appointments.

In internal, you should invite a co-worker to work with you in the specific room and not include the address. Example:

* SSW Boardroom Sydney
* SSW Boardroom Brisbane
* SSW Chapel Sydney
