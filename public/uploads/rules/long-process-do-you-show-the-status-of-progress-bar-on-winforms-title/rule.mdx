  body={<>
The importance of having the status of progress bar on winform's title:

- Users can clearly see the progress status
- If the winform is minimized to taskbar, users still can see the progress status
  </>}
/>
The form title should take the form of "[XX]% Completed - [Task Description] - [Product Name]".

There is another relevant rule about the [winform title](/title-bar-do-you-put-the-current-document-project-name-as-the-first-word-of-your-title-bar).
