Participating in tenders is a crucial way for businesses to secure large contracts, especially in software development and IT services. Many organizations, particularly government entities and large corporations, use professional tendering processes such as RFP (Request for Proposal) or RFQ (Request for Quotation) to ensure a transparent and fair procurement process. For companies aiming to participate, it is essential to be registered on relevant tender platforms and keep their information up-to-date to avoid missing out on opportunities.

### 1. Understand the Different Types of Tender Platforms

Tenders can be listed across a variety of platforms, each serving different levels of government and sectors:

* **Federal Government Platforms**: These platforms, such as [AusTender](https://www.tenders.gov.au/), require businesses to register and sometimes meet specific qualifications, this requires the venor to apply for a catagory and prove to the buying panel that they qualify.
* **State Government Platforms**: Each Australian state has its own tender portal (e.g., [NSW eTendering](https://tenders.nsw.gov.au/) for New South Wales), which companies must register for separately.
* **Local Government and Council Platforms**: Local governments also have their tender systems. Businesses may need to register on multiple local government platforms if they operate across several areas, Local government may also use 3rd party buying platforms.
* **Private and Commercial Platforms**: Besides government entities, many private companies use tender aggregation platforms like TenderSearch or BidContender to list their tenders. These platforms may consolidate tenders from various sources, making it easier to find relevant opportunities.

### 2. Registering and Qualifying for Tender Platforms

Registering on these platforms is not a one-time activity; it often requires:
* **Providing Comprehensive Business Information**: This includes insurance details, company contacts, and office locations.
* **Meeting Qualification Requirements**: Some platforms, particularly government ones, require businesses to qualify for certain categories. For instance, to be listed on ICT tenders for the federal government, companies may need to pass audits that verify their capabilities.
* **Regularly Updating Information**: Ensure that details such as insurance, certifications, accreditations, and contact information are current. Many tenders are time-sensitive, and missing an update could mean missing a tender opportunity.

### 3. Maintain a Presence on Industry-Specific Marketplaces

For IT and software companies, being present on platforms like the **Microsoft Marketplace** is essential:
* Microsoft is a trusted technology provider for many organizations. If companies are looking for specific solutions like cloud services or software upgrades, they often consult the Microsoft Marketplace.
* Suppliers like SSW need to qualify for different competencies (e.g., Gold Partner status) to be recommended for projects. This qualification process involves demonstrating capability through case studies, client references, and certifications. There may also be a need to demonstrate a spend on a Microsoft product by a client to qualify.

### 4. Consider Using Tender Aggregators

Due to the multitude of platforms, some companies opt to use tender aggregators:
* **Benefits of Aggregators**: These services compile tenders from multiple sources into one platform. This can save time and reduce the complexity of searching across multiple websites.
* **Weekly Monitoring**: Whether you use an aggregator or manage the process manually, it's essential to have a team member responsible for regularly monitoring relevant tender opportunities to ensure no potential contracts are missed.

### Conclusion

Being registered and maintaining an active presence on the right tender platforms is critical for securing contracts in a competitive market. This involves understanding the landscape, qualifying for relevant panels, keeping your information current, and possibly leveraging aggregators to simplify the process. By doing so, you ensure that you never miss a relevant opportunity and are always in a position to submit a compelling tender.
