Sending appointments from Teams feels less natural than from Outlook but there are some great benefits:

- Appointment - You don’t need to remember everyone’s name - The whole team is invited
- Appointment - In the appointment, it auto-generates a link so that everyone goes to the right place to attend
- Visibility - It shows up in Teams Calendar
- Visibility - It appears in the Teams chat (for the channel that was invited)
- Visibility – When the appointment is beginning the app pops up with a button to “Join”
- History - If you decide to record the meeting, the link to the recording shows up in the chat history as well

**Important:** Although the meeting app works great to organize Teamwork such as Scrum meetings or other client meetings, it is not very suitable for more global events such as a retreat or a conference. At SSW we use Microsoft Outlook appointments in those instances.

### How to make a Teams Meeting

To setup a Teams meeting, simply navigate to "Calendar" and then either "Meet Now" or "New Meeting".

  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'Creating a new meeting',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/send-appointment-or-teams-meeting/creating-new-meeting.jpg"
/>


<imageEmbed

  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'Meeting options',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/send-appointment-or-teams-meeting/meetings-options.jpg"
/>

You can select a Channel to meet in and by doing so, members of the Team in which this channel lives will see a Channel activity that you can click to directly jump in the meeting.

    preset: "default",
    figure: 'meeting channel activity',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/send-appointment-or-teams-meeting/meeting-channel-activity.jpg"
/>

Microsoft Teams will also send out an email invitation email for the meeting - this is especially useful when inviting people outside your organization.
