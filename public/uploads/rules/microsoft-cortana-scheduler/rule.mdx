## How to use Microsoft Cortana Scheduler (formerly known as Calendar.help)

This option is best if you're OK to meet any time that your calendar says is free.

**Note:** The helpful tool Scheduler has a portal too at calendar.help/user/dashboard

### Instructions to use Cortana

#### Step 1 - Register

Register yourself at Meet Scheduler before you can use this feature.

#### Step 2 - Send an email

Open an email... not an appointment!

<emailEmbed
  from=""
  to="Adam"
  cc="Cortana"
  bcc=""
  subject="Talk about Northwind project"
  body={<>
    ## Hi Adam

We need to talk about Northwind project.

==Cortana, schedule a meeting.==
  </>}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "after your message, add some request to Cortana as you would a PA",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
/>

Cortana then handles all the back-and-forth emails to find a time when everyone can meet and then she sends out an invite on your behalf.

  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Cortana will find a time that suits everyone and send the appointment",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/microsoft-cortana-scheduler/confirmation.jpg"
/>

#### Step 3 - Add Cortana as a contact

To make it easier to add Cortana to your emails, create a Contact.


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Cortana added as a contact",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/microsoft-cortana-scheduler/CortanaContact.jpg"
/>

✅ Works great on mobile:


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Microsoft Scheduler – Fully works on mobile phone",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/microsoft-cortana-scheduler/cortana-scheduler-mobile.jpg"
/>
