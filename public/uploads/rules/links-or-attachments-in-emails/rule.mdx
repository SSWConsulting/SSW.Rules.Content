seoDescription: Best practices for sending attachments in emails differ depending
  on whether you're communicating with internal or external parties. For internal
  communications, consider sharing links to a document store on your intranet to minimize
  broken links and keep the work alive.

How you work with attachments should change depending on who you are emailing.

For internal communications, linking to a document store on the intranet keeps files accessible, up-to-date, and minimizes the risk of broken links. When communicating externally, attaching the file directly is often more convenient for recipients who may not have access to internal systems.

## Internal documents - Use a link

If you're sending to a fellow employee, **use a link** to a document stored on your intranet (E.g.: `intranet.northwind.com/SharedDocuments`).

When sharing documents internally it's best to keep the work alive in a link. The best way to do that is to have it hosted in one place where all working parties can access it.

## External documents - Use a public link or attachment

If you're sending to a client, either get them to share a publically available link, or **attach the file** to the email (e.g.: a Spec Review).

It's often easier to **attach the file** than share a link due to permission issues. This allows them to easily share the document internally and always have access to the copy.

* Clients often prefer attachments
* They can forward it to whoever they want
* There is a paper trail of changes and feedback that they can share internally on their end
