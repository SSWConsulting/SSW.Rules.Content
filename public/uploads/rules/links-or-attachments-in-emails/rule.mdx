How you work with attachments should change depending on who you are emailing.

For internal communications, linking to a document store on the intranet keeps files accessible, up-to-date, and minimizes the risk of broken links. When communicating externally, attaching the file directly is often more convenient for recipients who may not have access to internal systems.

## Internal documents - link

If you're sending to a fellow employee, **use a link** to a document stored on your intranet (E.g.: `intranet.northwind.com/SharedDocuments`).

When sharing documents internally it's best to keep the work alive in a link. The best way to do that is to have it hosted in one place where all working parties can access it.

  }}

**Tip:** Using SharePoint can help minimizing broken links.

## External documents - public link or attachment

If you're sending to a client, either get them to share a publically available link, or **attach the file** to the email (e.g.: a Spec Review).

It's often easier to **attach the file** than share a link due to permission issues. This allows them to easily share the document internally and always have access to the copy.

* Clients often prefer attachments
* They can forward it to whoever they want
* There is a paper trail of changes and feedback that they can share internally on their end
