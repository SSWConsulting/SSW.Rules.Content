When you sell a training engagement you should invoice the client as soon as the training is confirmed by email, as training is always fixed price and the cost will not vary like a time and materials engagement.

Sending an invoice before the training begins acts as a confirmation of the training and allows the invoice to be paid a little earlier than usual.
