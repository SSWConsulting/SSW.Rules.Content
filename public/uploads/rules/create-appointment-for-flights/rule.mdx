Once you've [booked a flight](/do-you-know-how-to-book-better-flights/), it's important to keep track of it so everyone who needs to know can find the relevant details.
  </>}
/>
This is how you should create an appointment in the Outlook calendar for flights:

* Enter all of the flight details into the appointment. Use the ariplane emoji in the subject, and include your name, from/to, and the flight number. E.g. **"✈️ Adam Cogan - SYD -> BNE - QF 500 - 08 May 10:20 AM"**
* If someone is picking you up, include the arrival time and invite any relevant parties
* When possible, always include the terminal number in the location field. If a non-standard terminal, make it extra clear
  E.g. Jetstar flights should have highlighted: "WARNING: Different terminal. Allow more time".
* Make sure to include any unusual information about the flight
  E.g. "You are not flying with your preferred airline because &#123;&#123; REASON &#125;&#125;..." OR "As per our conversation, you are flying via Melbourne, because &#123;&#123; REASON &#125;&#125;..."
* Always include the price of the ticket in the message
* Do not forget to categorize the appointment as CONFIRMED RED so it cannot be overbooked
* Always create more than 1 appointment for flights that have more than one leg (connecting flights)
