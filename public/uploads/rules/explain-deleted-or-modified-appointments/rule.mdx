Every appointment change is disruptive, so always explain **why** it was necessary.

Unlike email, appointment updates don’t keep a visible history of the original content. It is a good idea to add a version number at the top to make changes transparent and track the timeline.

This avoids people starting to question how the change happened.

<endIntro _hidden="" />

Whenever you modify the time, attendees, or subject of an appointment, include a comment at the top explaining the reason for the change.

Altered appointments should include:

* **Your name** - If the appointment is sent from a shared mailbox or Team, it may not show who made the change. Include your name next to your comment for clarity
* **Version number** - Add a version number (v#) to the notes to help track changes.
* **[As per our conversation](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/as-per-our-conversation-emails)** - If the change is based on a conversation, mention who you spoke with in the note so others know who was involved

Example of a change comment:

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    (Calum – V2: Time changed after discussion with Bob, who cannot attend.)
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Author, version number, and reason included"
  style="greybox"
/>




<emailEmbed

  body={<>

    (Bob: V5 - Changed subject as we will be talking about Marketing first)

    (Bob: V3 - As per my conversation with Uly, adding him in because he wants to know about this)
