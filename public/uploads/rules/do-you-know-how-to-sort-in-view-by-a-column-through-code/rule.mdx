You may know that it is quite easy to sort view by a column through the UI.


<imageEmbed

  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Change view column sort from web UI",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-how-to-sort-in-view-by-a-column-through-code/SortInView.png"
/>

But when you are trying to do that via code, you may find a pretty tricky issue.
  </>}
/>
You can use some code like:

```sql
view.Query = "<OrderBy><FieldRef Name=\"Modified\" Ascending=\" FALSE \" /></OrderBy>";
```

**Figure: Use code to change view sort**

But the below code won't work:

```sql
view.Query = "<OrderBy><FieldRef Name=\"Modified\" Ascending=\" False \" /></OrderBy>";
```

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Bad example - The Ascending attribute is case-sensitive",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


The full code should be some code like:

```sql
SPView view = list.DefaultView;
view.Query = "<OrderBy><FieldRef Name=\"Modified\" Ascending=\" FALSE \" /></OrderBy>";
view.Update();
```

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "Good example - The Ascending attribute is using capital charactors as it is case-sensitive",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />
