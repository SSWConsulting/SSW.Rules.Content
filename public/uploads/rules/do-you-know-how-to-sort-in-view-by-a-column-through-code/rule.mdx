You may know that it is quite easy to sort view by a column through the UI.

But when you are trying to do that via code, you may find a pretty tricky issue.

<endOfIntro />

You can use some code like:

```sql
view.Query = "<OrderBy><FieldRef Name=\"Modified\" Ascending=\" FALSE \" /></OrderBy>";
```

**Figure: Use code to change view sort**

But the below code won't work:

```sql
view.Query = "<OrderBy><FieldRef Name=\"Modified\" Ascending=\" False \" /></OrderBy>";
```
**❌ Bad example - The Ascending attribute is case-sensitive**  

The full code should be some code like:

```sql
SPView view = list.DefaultView;
view.Query = "<OrderBy><FieldRef Name=\"Modified\" Ascending=\" FALSE \" /></OrderBy>";
view.Update();
```
**✅ Good example - The Ascending attribute is using capital charactors as it is case-sensitive**
