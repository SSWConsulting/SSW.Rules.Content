If you're creating new web apps in ASP.NET 2.0, do you still use  **Website projects** ? We strongly recommend using the new  **Web Application projects** .

What's the difference between the two? There is a [detailed comparison here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa730880%28VS.80%29.aspx#wapp_topic5?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-33518), but to summarize:

<endIntro />

* **Website projects**  have no project file and it creates multiples assemblies. (This result in a lot of annoying scenarios.)
* **Web Application projects**  have a physical project file and along with all other standalone classes within the project are compiled into a single assembly.

Please see our kb - [How to upgrade VS 2005 website Projects to be VS 2005 Web Application Projects?](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/KB/KB.aspx?KBID=Q1993822) to do the upgrade.
