  words.
title: Do you use "cannot" and "website" instead of separated words?

Grammatically, all of them are acceptable spellings, but in these specific cases, one word is more usual. Refer to [AskOxford](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/cannot)for reference.

Note: When there are two ways of doing something, we make a rule on it one way with the goal of having complete consistency.

We have a program called [SSW Code Auditor](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/) to check for this rule.
