Most of your reports (built in and custom) will be broken as the database schema has significantly changed.

To be ready for this, do a test migration and update any custom reports against the new database schema. That way, when your live server is up and running, your reports will be ready.

See [John Socha-Leialoha's post](http://www.socha.com/blogs/john/2009/10/upgrading-team-foundation-server-2008.html) for a good write up about what has changed and how to get your reports working.
