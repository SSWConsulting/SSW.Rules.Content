Running the "Dog Food" stats on your new TFS 2010 server is a good way to see if the upgrade was successful. You should check the new values against the [stats you noted down from your TFS 2008 server](/do-you-run-your-dog-food-stats-before1).
  </>}
/>
1. On TFS2010, run the DogFoodStats queries and save the results
2. Compare the numbers are the same
   **Note:** Number will differ slightly (usually increases as TFS2010 checks in a few more items)
   **Note:** Grant Holliday has never published exactly why they are not the same.
