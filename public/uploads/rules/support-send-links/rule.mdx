When offering support to customers using your product, think about whether this problem has occurred before or could happen again. If it has, there should be documentation available. This not only helps customers resolve their issues faster but also reduces the repetitive workload for the support team.

You should never have to answer the same question twice.
When you get a new question e.g. "Can I have co-authoring in TinaCMS?" these are the steps you should follow:

1. Check for existing documentation.
2. If it doesn't exist, create the documentation.
3. Reply with a link to the documentation.

Every support message should include a link to the relevant documentation or, if applicable, to a Product Backlog Item (PBI).

    Yes - you can do co-authoring in TinaCMS.\
You can do it by going to your TinaCloud account settings, filling out the Git co-author name and email, and then enabling it.

Let me know if you have any issues with this!

    Yes - you can do co-authoring in TinaCMS.\
Here is the link to the documentation: [How to enable co-author on Git commits?](https://tina.io/docs/introduction/faq#7-how-to-enable-co-author-on-git-commits).

Sometimes, you might get questions about bugs, upcoming features, or other things that are not documented. In this case,

  body={<>
    Not yet - We are still working on mermaid diagram support in TinaCMS. Check out this issue to see the status

  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Good Example - Sending a link to a PBI is also acceptable"
/>


After a while, you will build a great library of documentation that customers will use to self-serve their questions. This practice will also get you to read your documentation and improve it more often.

**Exceptions to this rule:**

* **Do not** write a documentation page if fixing the bug and releasing a new version solves the problem. In this case, create a PBI (or find an existing one) and reply with the link to it.
* **Do not** write a documentation page or PBI if the question/answer is irrelevant to your product, e.g., "Next.js - how do I deploy my app?" (This is not relevant to TinaCMS.)
