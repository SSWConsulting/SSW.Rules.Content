1. Be Flexible with Dates: Check different travel dates for better prices.
2. Use Fare Comparison Websites: Compare prices across platforms.

Booking directly with the airline is often the optimal choice, providing convenience and flexibility, especially when it comes to making changes to your itinerary.
However, before finalizing your decision on which flight to take, it's advisable to visit various comparison websites to evaluate the available options and determine the most suitable flight for your needs.

Here are sites that are recommended to check with:

- [skyscanner.com.au](https://www.skyscanner.com.au/)
- [Trip.com](https://www.trip.com/)
- [Expedia.com](https://www.expedia.com/)

After comparing the prices, we recommend going back to the airlines and booking through them directly.

Recommended carriers

For domestic flights:

- Qantas
- Virgin Australia

For international flights:

    **Notes:**

- It is not recommended to purchase domestic flights from overseas suppliers or WebJet.com, because the business cannot claim GST on their invoices.
- Make sure that before comparing the prices the quotes include all the taxes/surcharges/fees.
- Booking sites often charge some hidden fee during the checkout, check the fee breakdown carefully.
- Remember to check the currency, $ could be US dollars then you are paying 50% more than you think.
- Some travel companies, such as FlightCentre, are able to arrange your travel plans for you, but they often charge higher fees and have less flexibility if you change your mind.
