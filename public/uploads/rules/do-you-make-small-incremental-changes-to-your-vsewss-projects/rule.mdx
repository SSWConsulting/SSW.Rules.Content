- When working on packaging SharePoint artefacts into Features & Solutions, you should always make small incremental changes to your VSeWSS projects. Each time you should build & deploy to check you haven't broken anything.
- You should regularly make labels in TFS so you can quickly compare your changes against previous working versions to identify problems.
