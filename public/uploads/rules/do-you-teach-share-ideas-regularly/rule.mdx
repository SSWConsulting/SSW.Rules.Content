Each team member has their own set of skills. There is no use hiding those skills "under a bushel". If you can at least share one idea a week the team's shared knowledge increases. This has many positive spin-offs, for example, the teams don't become reliant upon one individual, and when your idea is adopted your confidence increases allowing you to make more contributions in the future. Importantly, it's not only management that should contribute this way. Everyone has something to share.

As an example, if you have a handy tip, send an email to your team or add it to the KB.
