The words we choose can significantly impact user experience. One such area of careful consideration is the language surrounding user authentication.
  </>}
/>
## User authentication

While **❌ "Log in"** has been widely used in the past, modern applications tend to prefer **✅ "Sign in"**. The term is widely recognized, intuitive, and aligns with current user expectations.

    **Note:** The term **"Login"** as a noun (no spaces) is still widely used in content, often interchangeably with the term **"Username"**.

<asideEmbed
  variant="info"

    **Warning:** It's advised to steer clear of using **❌ "Logon"**. This term, although it may have historical roots, has fallen out of favor and could potentially confuse users. Opting for more widely accepted alternatives ensures a smoother user experience.

## User account creation

When prompting users to create accounts, **❌ "Sign up"** can sometimes be confused with **"Sign in"**. To avoid this, **✅ "Register"** or **✅ "Create account"** can offer clearer direction and convey a greater sense of formality and commitment.

    **Note:** **✅ "Join"** is a versatile term that can be suitable, depending on the context. For instance, it works well when inviting users to become part of a group or community.
