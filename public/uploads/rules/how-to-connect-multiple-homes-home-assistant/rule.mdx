If you manage more than one Home Assistant server (e.g. home + office, holiday house, or multiple client sites), you don’t need multiple phones.

The Home Assistant Companion App supports multiple servers, and there are a couple of clean ways to keep things separated depending on your privacy needs.

<endIntro />

## Option 1 - Add another server in the Home Assistant Companion App (recommended)

This is the simplest approach. One app, multiple servers.

#### Add your second (or third) server:

1. Open the **Home Assistant** app
2. Go to **Settings |** **Companion **app
3. Tap **Add Server**
4. If your server is on the same network, it may appear automatically
5. If not, tap **Enter address manually** and paste your Home Assistant URL
6. Log in with your user account for that server

#### Switch between servers (quickly):

* 3-**finger swipe left/right**: switch to the previous/next server
* **3-finger swipe up**: open the server selection list

    Tip: If gestures don’t work (some phones intercept 3-finger gestures), you can always switch via Settings | Companion app, select the server, then Activate.

#### Important - privacy and sensor sharing

When you use one Companion App for multiple servers, your phone can share data (like sensors and location) to more than one server.

To reduce what gets shared with your work server:

1. Open the Home Assistant app
2. Go to Settings | Companion app
3. Select your Work server
4. Under Privacy, set Sensors Sent to None
5. Review Companion App permissions (Location, Notifications) and disable anything you don’t want sent to Work

## Option 2 - Use a PWA shortcut (separate “app” icons, no Companion App extras)

If you mainly want quick access to dashboards (without sharing phone sensors), use a browser shortcut as a pseudo-app.

###### iPhone (Safari)

1. Open Safari and browse to your Home Assistant URL
2. Tap Share
3. Tap Add to Home Screen
4. Name it Home Assistant - Home (repeat for Work)

###### Android (Chrome)

1\. Open Chrome and browse to your Home Assistant URL

2\. Tap More (⋮)

3\. Tap Add to home screen

4\. Tap Create shortcut

5\. Name it Home Assistant - Home (repeat for Work)

    Tip: This is great when you want a “Home” icon and a “Work” icon, without mixing Companion App sensors/permissions across servers.
