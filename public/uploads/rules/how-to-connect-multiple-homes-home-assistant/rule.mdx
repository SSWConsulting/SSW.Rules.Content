If you manage more than one Home Assistant server (e.g. home + office, holiday house, or multiple client sites), you don’t need multiple phones.

The Home Assistant Companion App supports multiple servers, and there are a couple of clean ways to keep things separated depending on your privacy needs.

<endIntro />

#### Option 1 - Add another server in the Home Assistant Companion App (recommended)

This is the simplest approach. One app, multiple servers.

###### Add your second (or third) server:

1. Open the **Home Assistant** app
2. Go to **Settings **-> **Companion **app
3. Tap **Add Server**
4. If your server is on the same network, it may appear automatically
5. If not, tap **Enter address manually** and paste your Home Assistant URL
6. Log in with your user account for that server
