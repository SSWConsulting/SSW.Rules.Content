Dynamics isn't as customisable as your average React or Angular website and there are some prohibitive restrictions. For example, M:M relationship records can only be added, updated and viewed via grids.

Use the power of [PCF controls](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/component-framework/overview?WT.mc_id=DX-MVP-33518) to customize Dynamics 365 and provide more flexible functionality.

<endOfIntro />

PCF controls let you use your favourite web technologies to develop customized components. You can use React, Angular, Bootstrap, web apis and more 😎. You no longer have to worry about learning new and confusing frameworks, you've got the power back in your hands!
