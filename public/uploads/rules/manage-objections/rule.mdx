Hearing "No" from a customer or manager can feel like a dead end, but it can be an opportunity to refine your approach. A rejection doesn't mean you give up.
  </>}
/>
Use this objection handling model.

## Step 1: Understand the real reason behind the "No"

Before pushing back, we need to make sure that we understand why the person declined. Common reasons include:

* Cost concerns
* Timing issues
* Pushing something that the client doesn't want
* Unclear value from the solution
* Pre-existing solution

Instead of immediately trying to resolve their issues with a solution, **ask questions** to understand their real hesitation:

    "We can use a cheaper LLM to ensure the solution is within your budget"
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Figure: Bad example – Trying to resolve the issue by assuming the customers concerns",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />



<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    
* "Can you help me understand what concerns you have with the current approach?"
* "If I could resolve this issue for you, could we move forward?"
* "Would it be helpful if I asked AI to better understand your concerns before we discuss this further?"
* "Is it alright if I speak to one of my developers about it and let you know about that later today?"
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "Figure: Good examples – Asking the right questions helps you refine your response",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />

  body={<>
    **Scenario:**
A client has rejected your proposal to integrate an AI-powered recommendation engine into their e-commerce platform. They haven’t provided much detail, just saying they’re “not sure about it.”

**AI prompt example:**
A client has declined our proposal to integrate an AI-powered recommendation engine into their e-commerce platform. They didn’t provide specific objections, just mentioned they’re ‘not sure about it.’ What are some common concerns clients might have about AI-driven recommendations, and what clarifying questions can I ask to uncover their hesitation?
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>


## Step 2: Return with a better argument

Once you understand their objections, adjust your approach. Here's how:

### 1. If cost is an issue: show the ROI

* Highlight long-term savings or increased revenue
* Compare the cost of inaction
* Offer a phased approach or a smaller-scale implementation

### 2. If timing is an issue: keep them engaged

* Ask "when would be a better time to revisit this?"

### 3. If they don't see the fit: provide better examples

* Use case studies relevant to their industry
* Show how similar clients have benefited
* Incorporate the clients feedback and offer a more tailored solution

### 4. If they don't see the value: clarify your messaging

* Simplify your explanation
* Use visuals, data, or examples to reinforce your point
* Focus on their issues rather than just listing features and benefits

## Step 3: Present with confidence

When you go back, don't just repeat your pitch **reframe it** based on what you've learned. Emphasise the value from their perspective, and make it clear you're there to solve their problem.


<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    **Scenario:**
"Why do you put 2 developers on the project? This is going to be more expensive isn't it?"

* Explain the benefits:

  * "We can complete the project sooner. Is that important to you?"
  * "You get more expertise - One person is more focussed on UI, the other person is stronger
    with databases"
  * "You get better quality code because the team are able to "put their heads together"
    to solve a problem - this saves maintenance costs down the track"
  * "We can continue working if 1 person gets sick"

If they are still unsure, you can offer a small discount off the hourly rate, or offer free support - it's all about managing risk.

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "Figure: Good example – Addressing concerns with data and real-world examples",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


## Step 4: Accept a final "No" with grace

If the client still says "No", accept it professionally. Leave the door open for future discussions:


<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    "I appreciate your time and insights. If anything changes in the future, I'd love to revisit this conversation."
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "Figure: Good example – Keeping the relationship positive for future opportunities",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


You can also "agree to disagree" - in that case send an ["as per our conversation"](/do-you-send-as-per-our-conversation-emails) email to state what you disagree with.

### Final thoughts

**You can turn a "no" into a "yes" when working with clients** – it’s all about perspective and understanding their needs!

"One of my favorite examples was when I was a young kid and I learnt that someone can change their mind. It came from the world of cricket 🏏 when the technology was starting to be used. Umpire Steve Bucknor, what was once heavily opposed to the 3rd umpire (aka DRS - Decision Review System), he eventually became one of its biggest advocates.

It taught me that even if somebody sounds strongly opposed to something if you can get them to change their mind they can become your greatest advocate."
