Just like a car, applications need servicing and tuning every now and then to stay in top condition. They might need alterations to deal with new business problems, or just tuning to increase efficiency.

<endOfIntro />

So you’ve done 10 good Sprints and the software has been delivered [(it's ready!)](/have-a-definition-of-ready) and the team is winding down. It will need maintenance.

Different clients need different levels of support. Offer your clients a few different support offerings.

## 1. Ongoing Maintenance

1 day per week (or whatever quantity suits), a developer will work on enhancements and bug fixing. This is useful because the client always knows when work will next be done.

## 2. Support Plan

For a small monthly cost, plus a multiple of the hourly rate, you can guarantee specific response and resolution times. This way your client will be guaranteed that they can get out of a fix quickly when needed.

## 3. Time and Materials or Prepaid

A client can simply call for bug fixing or support as and when needed. However, unless it's a show stopper, this model can involve waiting for developer availability.

## 4. Fixed Price Warranty

For a fixed price project, a warranty commences after the Sprint Review. The warranty length is half the length of the Sprint and, during this period, any bugs reported will be fixed for free.

### Warranty on a Fixed Price Contract

Once the Sprint Review is complete, the Product Owner has half the Sprint period again to report any bugs. The conditions are:

* The warranty period pauses when the client reports a bug that stops them testing further. The warranty period resumes when a new version is sent

  For example, the client may report a bug on a Wednesday morning on "Day 4" of the warranty. The bug is fixed on Friday and a new version is sent late in the afternoon. The warranty period resumes on Monday morning, at "Day 4". Therefore Wednesday through Friday was not included in the warranty
* During the warranty period, all feedback from clients should be moved to backlog unless they fall into the [bug definition](/definition-of-a-bug)
* There is no warranty on a time & materials contract
