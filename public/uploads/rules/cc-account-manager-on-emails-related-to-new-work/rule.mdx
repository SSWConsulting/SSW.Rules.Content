Once a project gets underway, it is not uncommon for the development team to take over a lot of the project management workload. Since they are the people most in contact with the client, sometimes new work will be organized through them instead of the Account Manager.

<endOfIntro />

When this is the case, the "As per our conversation" email should CC the Account Manager so he is always aware of all work being done, and can create a [new CRM opportunity](/data-entry-do-you-know-how-to-create-new-opportunities) if required.

  body={<>
    Hi Bob,

As per our conversation, you agreed to book me for another 2 weeks on this additional work.

**Note:** If an [initial meeting](/meetings-do-you-know-the-agenda-for-the-initial-meeting) is required for the new work, the Account Manager should be in attendance where possible to help continue the relationship.
