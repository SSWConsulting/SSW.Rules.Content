Keeping track of your company's reviews on external sites like Glassdoor and Google is essential for maintaining a strong online reputation. Responding constructively to both positive and negative feedback shows engagement and commitment to improvement. Ignoring reviews can mean missed opportunities for growth, while unresolved issues may impact your company's image and employee satisfaction.

## Verify your company on external websites

To manage your company's reviews effectively, you must first verify your company on the external website. This verification process often involves claiming your company's profile, which allows you to respond to reviews and access additional features.

## Check-in regularly

Make it a habit to log in regularly to monitor new reviews and feedback. Regular check-ins help you stay on top of what is being said about your company and allow you to address issues promptly.

## Set up notifications

Ensure that notifications of new reviews are sent to the company's information email address. This way, one or more employees can monitor and respond to reviews without relying on a single person. Distributing this responsibility ensures timely responses and continuous oversight.

## Respond to feedback appropriately

Responding to both good and bad feedback is essential. Acknowledge positive reviews with gratitude and address negative feedback professionally and constructively. This shows that your company values employee input and is committed to continuous improvement.

### 👍 Positive feedback

* Thank the reviewer for their positive comments
* Highlight specific points they appreciated and acknowledge their contribution

### 👎 Negative feedback

* Address the concerns raised by the reviewer directly
* Provide a clear explanation or steps being taken to resolve the issue
* Offer to continue the conversation offline if necessary

By following these practices, you can maintain a positive online reputation, demonstrate your commitment to employee satisfaction, and identify areas for improvement.
