Details on how you to create a link to a document in a SharePoint library.

**A. Create a shortcut in windows, then upload the shortcut file (.url) to the document library.**

To do this, you need to remove .url file type from your blocked file types in your web application. This will bring some security risk, which is not recommended, and I won't show the step details here.

**B. Use "Link to a document" content type in SharePoint.**

1. Enable "Content Type management" in your document library.

2. Add "Link to a Document" content type into the library.

3. Create a "Link to a document" instance

4. Done

You should be able to see the link type document in your library:
