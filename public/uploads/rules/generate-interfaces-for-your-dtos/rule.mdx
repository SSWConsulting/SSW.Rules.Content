Inevitably any well-engineered Angular application will need to send and receive data from a service of some sort – usually a Web API. A common mistake people make when doing this is using typescript’s built in **any** type for these services, which offers no type safety whatsoever.

  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: "Bad example - The \"any\" type is used as the DTO for this service. There is no type safety",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/generate-interfaces-for-your-dtos/dtogs-bad.png"
/>


One step better is to manually create interfaces for the DTOs. This gives type safety, but still means a lot of manual, tedious work to generate the interfaces.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "okExample",
    figure: "OK example - Manually coded interface ensures any object passed to the service is in the correct format",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/generate-interfaces-for-your-dtos/dtogs-ok.png"
/>


But this still doesn’t give safety over-the-wire – if the server side model changes, a developer has to remember to update it here, and hope that there are no typos. This is also extra effort to perform something mindlessly repetitive – something a machine is much better at doing. And we are programmers, right?

If your WebAPI has an OpenAPI (aka Swagger) specification, then the NSwag tools can build a complete Typescript client configured as an Angular injectable service - complete with:

- HttpClient calls that return Observables
- All defined endpoints implemented as methods in the service
- All DTOs included as Typescript interfaces

    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good example - NSwag generates the boring work so that you don't have to",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
