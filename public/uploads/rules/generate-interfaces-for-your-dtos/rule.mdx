Inevitably any well-engineered Angular application will need to send and receive data from a service of some sort – usually a Web API. A common mistake people make when doing this is using typescript’s built in **any** type for these services, which offers no type safety whatsoever.

<endIntro />

<imageEmbed alt="Image" size="large" showBorder={false} figurePrefix="bad" figure="Bad example - The &#x22;any&#x22; type is used as the DTO for this service. There is no type safety" src="/uploads/rules/generate-interfaces-for-your-dtos/dtogs-bad.png" />

One step better is to manually create interfaces for the DTOs. This gives type safety, but still means a lot of manual, tedious work to generate the interfaces.

<imageEmbed alt="Image" size="large" showBorder={false} figurePrefix="ok" figure="OK example - Manually coded interface ensures any object passed to the service is in the correct format" src="/uploads/rules/generate-interfaces-for-your-dtos/dtogs-ok.png" />

But this still doesn’t give safety over-the-wire – if the server side model changes, a developer has to remember to update it here, and hope that there are no typos. This is also extra effort to perform something mindlessly repetitive – something a machine is much better at doing. And we are programmers, right?

If your WebAPI has an OpenAPI (aka Swagger) specification, then the NSwag tools can build a complete Typescript client configured as an Angular injectable service - complete with:

* HttpClient calls that return Observables
* All defined endpoints implemented as methods in the service
* All DTOs included as Typescript interfaces

<imageEmbed alt="Image" size="large" showBorder={false} figurePrefix="good" figure="Good example - NSwag generates the boring work so that you don't have to" src="/uploads/rules/generate-interfaces-for-your-dtos/nswag.png" />
