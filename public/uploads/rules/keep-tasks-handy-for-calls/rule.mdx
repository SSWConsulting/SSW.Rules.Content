## Using Loop in Teams

1. **Create a Shared Workspace:** In Microsoft Loop, create a shared workspace to organize and manage your tasks collaboratively
2. **Add a Loop Component:** Inside the shared workspace, create a new Loop component where you will track your tasks
3. **Enter Tasks:** Record all your tasks, deadlines, and priorities into the Loop component
4. **Add Loop to Teams Tab:** Open your Teams Chat | Tabs | + | Search 'Website' | Paste in Loop Workspace URL | Rename tab, e.g. ToDo - Tanya and Adam

5. **Keep It Updated:** Regularly update the status of your tasks in the Loop component to keep it current
6. **Instant Access:** Ensure the Teams Tab with the Loop component is easily accessible so you can quickly pull it up when your Manager calls

By maintaining an organized and up-to-date task list in Loop, you will always be prepared to provide a comprehensive status update to your Manager. This not only helps in staying productive but also demonstrates your organizational skills and reliability.
