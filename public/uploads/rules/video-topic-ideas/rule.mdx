To keep your video content relevant and aligned with your business goals, it's crucial to revisit your marketing strategy regularly. One effective approach is to brainstorm new video topic ideas every three months based on your existing strategy. This helps ensure that your content stays fresh, targeted, and continues to engage your audience.
### Why think about video topics?

Marketing priorities may shift over time due to changes in business focus, customer feedback, or industry trends. By holding a dedicated brainstorming sessions, you can:

* **Stay aligned with your business goals:** Revisit your strategy and assess whether your video content is still on track.
* **Respond to market changes:** Adapt to new industry trends and address emerging customer concerns.
* **Ensure consistent content creation:** Avoid periods of stagnation by planning your content pipeline ahead of time.
