Recording a **public video** is time-consuming... scripting, filming, editing, and reviewing all take extra effort. The biggest waste happens when you record **before** verifying the accuracy of your content.

Before hitting record, a quick **content check** can save hours of rework and help you get it right the first time.

<endIntro />

## The problem

You’ve been asked to record a public video, and after filming, someone spots inaccurate content, missing context, or off-brand messaging. Now you have to re-record, wasting time and effort.

    **Tip:** Always make sure there’s a **documented request** for public videos, where the requester clearly states the video's public purpose. This ensures everyone understands its importance and treats it accordingly.

## The solution

Before you hit record, ask for a content check with a **Subject Matter Expert (SME)** or the **TV/Production Team**.

Think of it as the “[Checked by xxx](/checked-by-xxx)” rule for your video content.

### Steps for a public video recording

1. **Prepare yourself**
   * Write your talking points, slides, or short script
   * Know the key message you want to deliver
   * If you're sharing something on your screens, do a run through before recording to ensure the UI and workflow is as expected. 
2. **Get a content check and ask for feedback**
   * Send your draft or slides
   * Let the reviewer mark it as **Checked by {{ NAME }}**

<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    * If it’s a **technical/development topic**, get a **Dev SME** to review
    * If it’s a **production, marketing, or client-facing topic**, get a **TV/Production Team** member
    
    **Note:** Sometimes, it’s both!

1. **(Optional) Perform presentation/video in full over a call or in person**
   * Setup a time with them to perform your presentation/video in full over a call or in person. This way, you're getting rapid feedback in a 1 on 1 way. Saving you loads of time later down the line.
2. **Apply suggestions**
   * Update your outline before filming
   * You’ve passed the content check ✅
3. **Record with confidence**
   * Hit "Record" and share your wonderful knowledge

### Examples

<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    *“I’ve already recorded the full video — please review and tell me what to fix.”*
  </>}

<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    *“Here’s my outline for the Azure feature video - Content checked by Dave (Dev) and Ted (TV Team). Recording tomorrow.”*
  </>}
