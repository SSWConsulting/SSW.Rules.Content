<introEmbed
  body={<>
There are a few common controls we always use in our products. For example, DateTime and Ellipsis Button. We need a standard for the width so the controls should be more consistent.

**Note:** Controls on base forms will be made to be 'protected' rather than 'private', especially so that inherited forms of different sizes don't mess up.

We have a program called [SSW Code Auditor](https://ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/Rules.aspx#CommonControl) to check for the following two rules:

**Rule - C#/VB.NET UI- Button Height and Width - for Standard Button (75 x 23 pixels)**

- **Level 2:** All buttons \< 6 characters:\*\* Check the standard size (75 X 23 pixels) for buttons with the word length less than or equal to six characters, except the following buttons.
- **Level 1:** The action buttons:\*\* Check the standard size (75 X 23 pixels) for the following action buttons:

  - Add
  - Delete
  - Edit
  - OK
  - Close
  - Cancel
  - Save
  - Browse
  - Select
  - Test<
  - Next
  - Back
  - Remove
  - Refresh (Exception to the rule as it has 7 letters)
