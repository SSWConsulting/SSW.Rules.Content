When an Issue or Product Backlog Item (PBI) is created, it's important that team members review [the title](/meaningful-pbi-titles) and content to ensure it is clear and correct. Once you've done that, react with a 👍 (like) or 👎 (dislike) to show you've read it.

This small action keeps everyone informed and encourages collaboration and ownership across the team.
