When an Issue or Product Backlog Item (PBI) is created, it's important that team members review [the title](/meaningful-pbi-titles) and content to ensure it is clear and correct.

Once you've done that, react with a 👍 (like) to show you have read and agree.

If you **don’t** agree with a GitHub issue, please leave a quick comment to share why so everyone can understand your 👎 (dislike) and keep the discussion helpful.
