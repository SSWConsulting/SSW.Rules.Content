seoDescription: Long-running processes should be accompanied by a progress bar and
  cancellation option to provide transparency and control for users.
title: Long Process - Do you know that you should show a progress bar and allow users
  to cancel?
type: rule
uri: long-process-do-you-know-that-you-should-show-a-progress-bar-and-allow-users-to-cancel

The **last** thing a user wants is to be stuck waiting around for a long-running process to finish that they accidentally started in the first place. This heightens frustration with the application because:

- They do not know how long the process will last (adds uncertainty to the user experience)
- They cannot stop the process (creates lack of control in the user experience)

<endOfIntro />

Instead, keep users happy with your application by:

- Showing status description information above the progress bar
- Allowing the user to stop the process at any time by clicking "Cancel" (or as a minimum, prompt for confirmation before the long running process starts)
