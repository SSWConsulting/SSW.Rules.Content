### Why use Quiet Hours?

1. **Reduce Stress**: Continuous notifications can lead to burnout and stress
2. **Maintain Work-Life Balance**: Ensuring that work stays within its designated hours is crucial for personal well-being
3. **Minimize Unnecessary Interruptions**: For non-urgent communications, email is often less intrusive than instant messages. [Do you send emails for tasks only?](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/use-email-for-tasks-only/)

### How to Enable Quiet Hours

1. Open the **Teams app** on your mobile device and tap on your profile picture in the top left corner
2. Navigate to **Notifications** | **Under Blocked notifications** | **During quiet hours**
3. Set your preferred **Quiet Hours** (specific hours) and **Quiet Days** (specific days)
4. To sync quiet hours across all mobile devices, turn on the **Set on Teams and Outlook** toggle

### Tips for Effective Use

* **Set Clear Expectations**: Inform your team about your Quiet Hours to align communication strategies
* **Encourage Alternatives**:
  * Use emails for non-urgent matters
  * Escalate urgent issues through other means if necessary

### Related Considerations

* For urgent or emergency communications, follow the principle of using calls or alternative means
* Understand the broader implications of after-hours messaging and employee rights under regulations like the [Right to Disconnect](https://www.fairwork.gov.au/employment-conditions/hours-of-work-breaks-and-rosters/right-to-disconnect)

By using Quiet Hours in Microsoft Teams, you can enjoy better focus at work, a healthier personal life, and a more effective communication strategy within your team.
