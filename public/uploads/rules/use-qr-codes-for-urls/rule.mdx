Have you ever watched an awesome presentation? The presenter promises to share some resources. You’re excited to see what they recommend. But then they start racing through their slides. The URLs flash past before you can even write them down. Frustrating, right? Don’t do that to your audience.

## Use QR codes in marketing materials

You should put QR codes in all your marketing material, wherever there is a URL.
This reduces friction for interested people trying to view your website!

    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good example - We use QR codes in our banners in conference, making attendees more likely to open the website on their phones",

  } }

## Use QR codes in presentations

Sometimes you need to show URLs on a slide. For example, you might be talking about the URLs themselves. But when you’re sharing resources, your audience struggles to write them down. The URLs slip past before they’re ready. And if you linger on the slide just so people can copy them, it breaks your flow.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: "Bad example - A long URL is impossible to note down",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/use-qr-codes-for-urls/url-in-presentation-bad.png"
/>


A better approach is to use QR codes in your slides. Your audience scans the code in a second. They can bookmark the resource right away, without becoming stressed.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good example - A QR code is easier for the audience to quickly scan during a talk",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/use-qr-codes-for-urls/url-in-presentation-good.png"

**Tip:** You can use an Office add-in called QR4Office to directly generate these QR codes for slides within PowerPoint.
