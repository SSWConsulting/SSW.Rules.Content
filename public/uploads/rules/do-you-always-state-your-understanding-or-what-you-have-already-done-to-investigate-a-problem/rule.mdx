When you seek advice or help from another, firstly, you need to establish with them:

- Your understanding
- Methods you have previously attempted in order to resolve the problem

    **Tip:** Be aware that you don't want them to reply with [LMGTFY](https://www.lmgtfy.com) 🙂

By not stating what you have previously attempted to resolve the problem, the person you are seeking advice from may be wasting time if they suggest methods you have already done.

By stating what you have previously attempted to resolve the problem, the person you are seeking advice from will not suggest for you to do the same methods again, and will look for other ways to resolve the issue.
