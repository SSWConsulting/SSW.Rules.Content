Let's say you press "Send" and get a bounce. E.g. An email in your inbox that reads:

<endOfIntro />


<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    
Delivery has failed to these recipients or distribution lists:

Adam Cogan &#123;&#123; EMAIL ADDRESS &#125;&#125;
**The recipient's email address was not found in the recipient's email system**. Microsoft Exchange will not try to redeliver this message for you. Please check the email address and try resending this message, or provide the following diagnostic text to your system administrator.

  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>


Get the correct email address and ‘Reply to all’ with just this text in brackets:


<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
      (Resending with Adam’s correct email)

---------------------------------
  &#123;&#123; ORIGINAL EMAIL &#125;&#125;
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good example - Correct the email address and send again",
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
/>
