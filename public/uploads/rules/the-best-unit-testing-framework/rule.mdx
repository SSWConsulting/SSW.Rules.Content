**😐 OK Example: NUnit - For previous versions of .NET, NUnit was the best testing library but required work on the Continuous Integration server to get the unit tests to run in a CI environment. One of the key features that NUnit had that MS Test didn't was the TestCase attribute that allows you to specify inline data to be used when invoking that test**  
**✅ Good Example: XUnit comes out of the box with .NET Core and includes most of the great features of NUnit, while also being supported out of the box with Team Foundation Server and Visual Studio Team Services**
