Linq is a fantastic addition to .Net which lets you write clear and beautiful declarative code. Linq allows you to focus more on the **what** and less on the **how** .

You should look for opportunities to replace your existing code with Linq.

<endIntro />

For example, replace your foreach loops with Linq.

```csharp
var lucrativeCustomers = new List<Customer>();

foreach (var customer in Customers)
{
    if (customer.Orders.Count > 0)
    {
        lucrativeCustomers.Add(customer);
    }
}
```

Figure: Bad Example - imperative programming using a foreach loop

```csharp
var lucrativeCustomers = Customers.Where(c => c.Orders.Count > 0).ToList();
```
