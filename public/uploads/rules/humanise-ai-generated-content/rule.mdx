Creating content that sounds human is essential for engaging readers and meeting quality standards. AI-generated content can sometimes feel robotic, lacking the natural flow and personal touch that human writing possesses. To address this, we can use specific techniques to make ChatGPT's content more human-like, improving its readability and relatability.
## Techniques for Humanizing AI Content

1. **Use Personas:**

   * Assign ChatGPT a specific role, such as a friendly advisor or an expert in a particular field, to guide the tone and style.
   * Example: "As a seasoned travel blogger, describe the best destinations for solo travelers."
2. **Incorporate Personal Experiences:**

   * Share personal anecdotes or opinions to add authenticity.
   * Example: "Include this story about my favorite childhood memory related to the topic: &#123;&#123; ADD STORY &#125;&#125;"
3. **Fact Insertion:**

   * Add relevant and recent facts to make the content more informative and credible… Things that the AI’s cut off date mean it couldn’t know.
   * Example: "Include these statistics on the current market trends for this industry: &#123;&#123; ADD FACTS &#125;&#125;"
4. **Perplexity:**

   * Avoid common AI phrases and terms that make the text sound unnatural.
   * Perplexity measures the complexity and unpredictability of text. To make AI-generated content sound more human, avoid overused and predictable phrases. This enhances the natural flow and makes the content more engaging.
   * Example: "Don’t always use the most natural words. Use the following words fewer than three times on this page: unique, ensure, utmost, meticulous, meticulously, navigate, navigation, digital era, art of, secrets of, ever-evolving, unlock, bespoke, realm of, utilize, synthesize, conceptualize, paradigm, leverage, pivot, robust, synergy, optimize, utilize, orchestrate, cultivate.”
5. **Burstiness:**

   * Vary sentence and paragraph lengths to create a dynamic flow.
   * Example: "Mix short and long sentences to enhance readability."
6. **Unfluffing:**

   * Ensure every sentence provides value and is actionable, removing unnecessary filler content.
   * Example: "Eliminate vague statements and focus on specific, useful information."
7. **Adding Flavor:**

   * Make the content more engaging and conversational by adding humor, anecdotes, and a conversational tone.
   * Example: "Engagement is the highest priority. Be conversation, empathetic, and occasionally humerous. Use idioms, metaphors, anecdotes, and natural dialogue."
8. **Targeting Specific Audiences:**

   * Tailor the content to the preferences and needs of your target audience.
   * Example: "Adjust the tone and vocabulary to match the reading level and interests of a young adult audience."
9. **Training on Your Writing Style:**

   * Provide samples of your own writing to train ChatGPT to mimic your unique voice.
   * See [Do you know how to train an AI to write in your style?](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/train-ai-to-write-in-your-style) for a deep dive into how to do this effectively
