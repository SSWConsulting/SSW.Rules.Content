  body={<>
Code that looks perfectly fine in a single-threaded scenario could be vulnerable to race condition when some value is shared among multiple threads.
  </>}
/>
Examine the following if-statement:

```csharp
if (A is null || (A.PropertyA == SOME_CONSTANT && B))
{
   // some logic
}
```

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: 'Figure: Bad example - Vulnerable to race condition',
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


When the above code is run single-threaded, the second part of the if-condition would never be reached when A is null. However, if A is shared among multiple threads, the value of A could change from not null to null after passing the first check of if-condition, resulting in a [NRE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.nullreferenceexception?view=net-7.0&WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-33518) in the second check of if-condition.

In order to make the code thread-safe, you should make a local copy of the shared value so that value change caused by another thread would no longer lead to crash.

```csharp
var copyA = A?.PropertyA;

if (A is null || (copyA == SOME_CONSTANT && B))
{
   // some logic
}
```

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: 'Figure: Good example - Local copy to resolve race condition',
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />
