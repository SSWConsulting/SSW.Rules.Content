It is important that the system administrator can easily find out how reliable his servers are. This can be achieved using tools like What's Up Gold (WUG) [https://www.whatsupgold.com](https://www.whatsupgold.com) to monitor many statistics e.g.:

- Uptime - Ping, Interface monitor
- Performance - RAM usage, CPU usage
- Network - Bandwidth, Interface throughput
- Storage - Disk usage, health

For example, here is a report in WhatsUp Gold you can use to monitor servers on a daily basis.

    shouldDisplay: true
  } }

Another option is to use WUG's built-in email alerts, which can be formatted in HTML or plain text. You can also add variables that change based on the current state of devices and other stats.

  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "OK Example - Editing WUG's email action is simple, but HTML skills are necessary to make a good looking report",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }

The best option is to use SQL Reporting Services to create a custom report that can be emailed via a data-driven subscription, which sends a nicely formatted email when there's a problem.

    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
