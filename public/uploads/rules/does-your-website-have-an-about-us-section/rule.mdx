One of the first things to include when building a website is an “About Us” section. An “About Us” section adds credibility and, more importantly, gives readers a clear overview of you and your company.

<endIntro />

A strong “About Us” page is based on **four key criteria**. These represent the aspects potential clients typically want to understand before engaging with a business. 

## Target

Define who you serve, where you operate, and what you specialize in. This includes your location, your area of expertise such as enterprise .NET solutions, and the products or services you offer.

## Credibility

Highlight proof points that build trust. This can include long-standing industry involvement, such as running a Microsoft .NET User Group for many years, as well as leadership credentials like having a Chief Architect who is a Microsoft Regional Director.

## Services offered

Clearly describe what you provide and how you deliver value. This should cover the technologies you use and the customized software solutions you build for clients.

## Goals

Explain your purpose and direction. For example, developing tailored solutions for each client that meet their specific requirements.
