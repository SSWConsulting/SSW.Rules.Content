Visual Studio provides a Report Viewer control for WebForms, so use it instead of the old IFrame method. The report viewer control is super easy to use - just drag the control into your page designer and select the properties you like.

<endIntro />

The bad old way was to use an IFrame and point it to the report's URL (including parameters). This is bad because you might encounter a typing error. If you want to disable vertical scrollbar, you need to adjust the height of IFrame manually. Furthermore, you can't configure the report's authentication separately.

```sql
<IFRAME width="100%" height="700" TITLE="Report" src="http://reports.internal.ssw.com.au/ReportServer?
    %2fTimeProOnlineReports%2fClientRegisteredProductsByDate
    &rs:Command=Render&ClientContactID=<%=mintClientContactID%>&ClientExInfo=<%=clientInfo%>&rc:Parameters=false">
</IFRAME>
```
**❌ Bad Example - Embed report using IFrame**  

```sql
<rsweb:ReportViewer ID="ReportViewer1" runat="server" SizeToReportContent="True" ProcessingMode="Remote" Width="100%" AsyncRendering="false">
    <ServerReport ReportServerUrl="http://reports.internal.ssw.com.au/reportserver"
    ReportPath="/TimeProOnlineReports/ClientRegisteredProductsByDate" />
</rsweb:ReportViewer>
```
**✅ Good Example - Embed report using Report Viewer**
