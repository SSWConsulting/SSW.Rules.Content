If you are wondering how many times you should post on your social media, the answer is: **as often as you can post great and relevant content.** You don't have to post every hour to be relevant, and in fact, you can be seen as a spammer on socials.

As [Neil Patel](https://neilpatel.com) says: _"If you post too infrequently, your audience will forget that you exist and you will quickly fade into the deep dark recesses of their minds. However, if you are posting too often, you will become a complete nuisance and they will dread seeing your posts overcrowding their feed."_

Most marketers recommend at least 1 post a day, depending on the social media platform - you might find that this can hard on YouTube, for example. In general, consistency is key. Make sure you have a routine set to follow up your insights for a deep dive into your metrics and you will find out what works best for your audience.

You can use a [social media management tool like Buffer](/do-you-use-buffer-to-post-to-social-media) to post to your social media platforms at least 3 times a week (ideally daily) with upcoming events, information about products or services, relevant news, or anything else that you think your followers would be interested in.
