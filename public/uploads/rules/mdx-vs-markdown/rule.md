Let's face it, not all content is created equal. Sometimes you just need a simple document, and other times you want something more dynamic and interactive.

<!--endintro-->


## When to use Markdown (.md)

Markdown is perfect for straightforward content. Think of it like writing a clear, no-frills document. You'll want to use Markdown when:

- You're creating something simple like a blog post, documentation, or guide
- Your team includes people who aren't tech experts
- You want your page to load quickly
- You just need basic formatting like headings, lists, and images

**Example:** A recipe blog post with some text, headings, and a few pictures. Markdown handles this beautifully without any extra complexity.

## When to use MDX (.mdx)

MDX steps up when you need something more powerful. It lets you add interactive elements and custom components to your content. You'll want MDX when:

- You need interactive features that go beyond static text
- You want to include custom components from different web frameworks
- Your content requires some programming logic
- You're creating tutorial content with live examples


::: greybox
**Example:** A coding tutorial with an interactive chart showing performance metrics, or a documentation page with a live code editor where readers can try out code in real-time.

## Things to consider

MDX isn't perfect for every situation. Before you jump in, consider:

- **Complexity** - Since it's more advanced than plain Markdown, non-technical teams might find it tricky
- **Performance** - Too many fancy components can slow down your page
- **Extra setup** - You'll need to manage more technical dependencies

## The golden rule ⭐️

Choose Markdown for simple, fast content. Choose MDX when you need more interactive and dynamic features.

The key is to start simple. Use Markdown for most of your content, and only switch to MDX when you truly need those extra capabilities.
