If you have customers, then you need Zendesk. More than 300 million people around the world receive support from Zendesk-powered customer service departments and help desks. While industry averages point to low customer satisfaction, Zendesk customers experience positive ratings for over 86% of their interactions.

<endIntro />

Why? It's the Zendesk difference. The unique approach to customer engagement enables you to listen, respond, and delight your users in ways not possible before. Zendesk is not just another help desk tool. It is the easiest and fastest way to great customer service.

Much like the art of Zen, the path to customer service excellence is a continuous journey that involves product, people, practice.
