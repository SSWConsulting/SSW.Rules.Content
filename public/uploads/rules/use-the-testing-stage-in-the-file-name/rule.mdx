When moving through the different stages of testing i.e. from internal testing, through to UAT, you should suffix the application name with the appropriate stage:

<!--endintro-->

| **Stage**       | **Testing Description**                                            | **Naming Convention**    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Alpha           | Developer testing with project team                                | Northwind_v2-3_alpha.exe |
| Beta            | Internal “Test Please" testing with non-project working colleagues | Northwind_v2-3_beta.exe  |
| Production e.g. | When moving onto production, this naming convention is dropped     | Northwind_v2-3.exe       |
