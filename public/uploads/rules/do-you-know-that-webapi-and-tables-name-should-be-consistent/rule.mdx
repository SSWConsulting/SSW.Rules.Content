By making the endpoint name the same as the table name, you can simplify development and maintenance of the WebAPI layer.

In some circumstances you may not have direct control over the database, and sometimes you may be exposing a resource that doesn't have a meaningful analogue in the database. In these situations, it may make sense to have different endpoint names - if doing so will simplify development for consumers of your WebAPI endpoints.
