    **Why use pair programming when you can use AI 😉?**

[AI can work as your pair](/ai-pair-programming), handling repetitive tasks, give quick feedback, and help with decision-making, making it easier to work solo in certain situations. While AI can't fully match the creativity and interaction of working with someone else, it's a great tool for cutting down the need to team up for routine or technical tasks.

Whether it's brainstorming, coding, or tackling complex tasks, working in pairs often leads to more efficient and high-quality results.

## For everyone

* **Less time stuck on a problem** - Having someone familiar with the project will help you work through the problem
* **Mutual motivation and knowledge sharing** - Keep each other motivated and absorb knowledge from each other
* **Increased productivity** - Experience shows that two people working on a problem together are often more productive than one person working alone for twice as long

## For developers

* **Code will have less workarounds** - If something doesn't add up to a developer, they've got someone to ask
* **Cleaner code** - You know someone else is going to be looking at your code
* **Support** - When you need changes down the track, you have two people to call on

> _"I have found developers work better in pairs. I am not a fan of the classical pair programming - which is 2 developers working on the 1 PC. There are times for that especially during brainstorming activities, however on a day-to-day basis, I advise that developers work in pairs, but they each have their own PC."_

If you are not sitting next to a person working on the same project, then fix it. If you cannot then at least mention it to your manager.

## Working alone and getting stuck

If you find yourself working alone, which we don't recommend, you should speak up as soon as possible. You should make it clear that working alone is not best practice and that developers working together are worth more than the sum of their parts.

1 dev plus 1 dev doesn't equal 2 devs worth of work. It equals 3! 🎉

## Is there an overhead?

Some projects are done quicker with two people - especially when they are complex. But on most projects there is an overhead, because of the extra communication between the developers - you now have to please someone else - not just yourself.

Estimates vary for the overhead, but say it is 20% extra, this is more than offset by the cleaner code and better solutions that come from two brains working together.

## What if you are working remotely from each other?

If you are working with someone remote, you will be using an application like [Teams, TeamViewer, or another support tool](/do-you-know-the-best-way-to-give-the-best-customer-support) to view one another's desktops so you can help each other out when necessary. You should have [a 2nd monitor](/efficiency-do-you-use-two-monitors).

## What is the best code collaboration tool?

[Visual Studio Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/) - See Video (3 minutes):

<youtubeEmbed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2ceblXTBBc" description="" />

* VS Code - [Install extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare)
* Visual Studio 2022! It's built in!

[Code With me](https://www.jetbrains.com/code-with-me/) - A great tool for JetBrains IDE users who want to pair program. Though it isn't supported in Rider right now.

## Alternative approach when there’s not enough budget or work: weekly senior involvement

In situations where there isn't enough work for two people, or budget constraints limit resources, an alternative can be adopted. This approach involves a single developer handling the majority of development tasks, with a more senior developer contributing primarily on Sprint Review day. See below for an example:

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    If a client only has 1 developer working with them for 1 day a week, they must still keep regular Scrum cadence. In this case they would break the work down into 5-week (5 working days) Sprints. Every 5th booking, a senior developer or Solution Architect must be booked with them to ensure the project is running smoothly and to help them plan the next Sprint.
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

The primary developer progresses the project mostly autonomously, while the senior developer's weekly involvement primarily ensures strategic oversight and quality control, particularly during Sprint Reviews. While the primary developer has greater autonomy, the availability of the senior developer for occasional guidance is crucial. This ensures the project remains on track and the primary developer does not feel isolated.

In a situation where we can’t even do the above, get cross-approval from another Account Manager to make sure the exception makes sense.
