You can check your DNN version via the "Host Memu", then "Host Settings" and tick the "Check For Upgrades" check box to see the latest version

It would be nice if DNN version can be checked by [Better way of checking DotNetNuke version on 'DotNetNuke Suggestions'](https://ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/BetterSoftwareSuggestions/DotNetNuke.aspx#Version).
