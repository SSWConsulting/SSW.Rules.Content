Always **introduce yourself** to the audience. However, it is not great to bring up the 'About' slide too early, so you should do it \*after\* you have asked the audience who they are.

Don't be shy, tell them:

- Who are you?
  - Optional - include something personal
- What you do (your service or product)?
- What makes you qualified to speak on this topic?
