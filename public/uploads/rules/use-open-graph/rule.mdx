Open Graph is a metadata tag that allows you to control what content shows up when a page is shared on social media networks.

<endIntro />

It should be placed on the &lt;head&gt; section of your page. The most used properties are:

```xml
<meta property="og:title" content="Your Custom Title" />
<meta property="og:description" content="Your custom description of the page." />
<meta property="og:image" content="https://www.YourCustomImage.jpg"/>
```

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure='Bad example - Shared link has no image and the title was "guessed" by LinkedIn'
  src="/uploads/rules/use-open-graph/open-graph-bad.jpg"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Good example - Shared link has a nice image and title, both defined via Open Graph tags"
  src="/uploads/rules/use-open-graph/opengraph-good.jpg"
/>



<boxEmbed
  style="info"
  body={<>
    **Note:** For LinkedIn you might need to add the prefix as following:

```xml
&lt;metaprefix="og: http://ogp.me/ns#" property='og:title' content="Microsoft Azure | SSW Consulting - Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne"/&gt;
```

  </>}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure=""
/>
