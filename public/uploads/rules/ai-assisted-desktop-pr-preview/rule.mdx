seoDescription: Quickly test AI-built desktop features by switching to PR pre-releases
  in your desktop app. Avoid slow local branch builds and adopt a professional AI-assisted
  workflow for Electron apps.
title: Do you use PR pre-releases to rapidly test AI-built desktop features?
type: rule
uri: ai-assisted-desktop-pr-preview
---

Previously, testing desktop features created with AI agents meant checking out a PR branch locally, building the app, and running it manually. Which took time, slowed feedback loops, and encouraged "vibe coding" where changes are shipped without a deep understanding of the code.

By exposing a settings option to switch to specific PR builds, they can be easily installed tested - no local branch juggling or manual builds required.

<endOfIntro />

## Why this matters

* Faster feedback for AI-generated changes without compromising quality
* Realistic testing inside the desktop runtime, not just mock environments
* Reduced friction for reviewers and Product Owners
* Encourages the professional Plan → Discuss → Implement → Review cadence

## The new workflow

1. Plan the change with context and constraints
2. Ask your AI agent to implement a small, self-contained step
3. Automatically build a PR pre-release via CI
4. In your desktop app, switch to that PR pre-release from Settings
5. Review the behavior in-app, run tests, and capture findings
6. Iterate until the feature is complete, then merge

## Tips for professional AI-assisted development

* Prefer small, focused steps that map one-to-one to PRs
* Write down assumptions and risks in the PR description
* Add lightweight checks to catch regressions early
* Use screenshots or short videos for reviewers
* Keep a changelog entry for user-visible behavior
