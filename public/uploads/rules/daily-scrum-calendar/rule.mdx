You should have a centralized calendar to easily find all your company's Daily Scrum meetings.

The easiest way to do this is to use a shared calendar that is just used for Daily Scrums. At SSW, we have the **SSWDailyScrum** calendar for this. This requires each team to send their Daily Scrum as a recurring appointment to the SSWDailyScrum calendar.

This calendar helps mapping all the SSWDailyScrum appointments, by keeping them all together, and anyone who wants to know about any team's Daily Scrum can use this calendar to find out when it is.
