Excess punctuation without purpose can make a document or web content look unnecessarily busy. It adds unexpected visual clutter, especially in short or standalone text like **list items**, **captions**. For **URLs**, the reason is not just visual - adding a period at the end can break the link when it's copied or clicked.

<endIntro />

## List items

Bullet points should be short and sharp, and should generally **not** require full stops at all.


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    
* Sentence one.
* Sentence two.
* Sentence three.

  </>}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure="Too much punctuation"
/>



<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    
* Sentence one
* Sentence two
* Sentence three

  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Clean with no full stops"
/>


## Captions

Image captions should be short and sharp, and should generally **not** require full stops at all.


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    
&#123;&#123; IMAGE &#125;&#125;\
**Figure: A group of people in a meeting room.**

  </>}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure="Too much punctuation"
/>



<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    
&#123;&#123; IMAGE &#125;&#125;\
**Figure: A group of people in a meeting room**

  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Clean with no full stops"
/>


### What about multiple sentences in one element?

If your bullet point or caption has more than one sentence, consider rephrasing it, or using a different separator - like a dash; you could also consider a semicolon instead.

However, if it **is necessary** to have more than one sentence in these items (should be rare) a full stop is needed. In this case, you should end with a full stop for consistency and completeness.


<boxEmbed
  style="info"
  body={<>
    **Reminder:** The rest of figure captions and the bullet points on content **should not have full stops**.
  </>}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure=""
/>



<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    
&#123;&#123; IMAGE &#125;&#125;\
**Figure: A group of people in a meeting room. They appear to be engaged in a discussion**

* Sentence one
* Sentence two. Sentence three
* Sentence four. Sentence five. Sentence six
* Sentence seven

  </>}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure="A multi-sentence item becomes a mini-paragraph - not ending it with a full stop looks inconsistent"
/>



<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    
&#123;&#123; IMAGE &#125;&#125;\
**Figure: A group of people in a meeting room. They appear to be engaged in a discussion.**

* Sentence one
* Sentence two. Sentence three.
* Sentence four. Sentence five. Sentence six.
* Sentence seven

  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Multi-sentence items should end with a full stop for consistency"
/>


## URLs

[Descriptive links](/descriptive-links) are recommended whenever possible, but if you must display the raw URL, remember to avoid adding a full stop at the end, as it can break the link when copied or clicked.
