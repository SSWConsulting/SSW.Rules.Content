Using screen captures is a good practice - pictures do tell a thousand words - but don't include unnecessarily huge images or attachments in your email.
  </>}

When your attachment is too big, you should think twice.

## Avoid large attachments

If you're sending an email with attachments or images over 1 MB, consider uploading the file to a server (e.g., Google Photos or Microsoft Teams) and [include the link in the email](/links-or-attachments-in-emails) instead.

    **Note:** Photos taken with modern smartphones ðŸ“± are often quite large. A single high-resolution image can easily be 2â€“5 MB, and some mobile devices produce photos over 10 MB - far above the ideal size for email attachments.

Some email clients may prompt you to resize images before sending, but if they donâ€™t, consider resizing them yourself or sharing via a link instead.

PS: Sending the image as a link as it is too big to attach.

    **Note:** An added advantage is that the document stays alive. If the URL has been updated and a user takes a week to get around to this email, they will view the latest version.

## Tips

1. Reduce the size by sending just the relevant part of the image you need
2. Avoid **.bmp**. Use **.jpg**, **.gif** or **.png** instead
3. If you are sending photos (every year cameras are making our photos bigger and bigger) you may need to [resize them down](https://imagecompressor.com/)
4. If you have multiple files, consider .zip them
5. SharePoint was built with sharing files in mind and is a great way to collaborate. If you are using SharePoint to send a file you simply need to open the context menu, click "send to" and "email a link" as shown:

  
<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'SharePoint makes it easy to share or just copy the link',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/avoid-large-attachments-in-emails/sharepoint-file-share.png"
/>

## When can you break these size rules?

Basically, you should be practical:

1. There is no other way under particular circumstances
2. To keep the history if the file is already part of the thread
