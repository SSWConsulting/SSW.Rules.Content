Using screen captures is a good practice - pictures do tell a thousand words - but don't include unnecessarily huge images or attachments in your email.

When your attachment is too big, you should think twice.
Avoid large attachments. If you are sending an email with attachments or images that are **greater than 1MB** you need to consider:

* Files - Could a URL be better than this attachment?
  * Could I send this as a UNC to an internal share?
* Images - Could I put this picture on Google Photos or another image server?

PS: Sending the image as a link as it is too big to attach.

### Tips

1. Reduce the size by sending just the relevant part of the image you need

2. Avoid **.bmp**. Use **.jpg**, **.gif** or **.png** instead

3. If you are sending photos (every year cameras are making our photos bigger and bigger) you may need to [resize them down](https://imagecompressor.com/).

4. If you have multiple files, consider .zip them

5. SharePoint was built with sharing files in mind and is a great way to collaborate. If you are using SharePoint to send a file you simply need to open the context menu, click "send to" and "email a link" as shown:


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'SharePoint makes it easy to share or just copy the link',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/avoid-large-attachments-in-emails/sharepoint-file-share.png"
/>

### When can you break these size rules?

Basically, you should be practical:

1. There is no other way under particular circumstances
2. To keep the history if the file is already part of the thread
