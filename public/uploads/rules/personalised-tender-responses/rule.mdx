Winning tenders is not about filling in templates or repeating polished marketing statements. It’s about clearly demonstrating that you understand the customer’s problem, that your solution directly addresses it, and that you can prove you will deliver the outcome they care about.

<endIntro />

Weak tender responses are usually generic, internally focused, and full of unsubstantiated claims. Strong responses are clear, structured, customer-focused, and credible.

## Start with the customer’s problem, not your company

The most common mistake in tender writing is starting with your company, your services, or your technology. That’s not what evaluators are looking for.

They went to market because they have a problem. Your first job is to show that you understand it.

If you start by talking about yourself, you’re trying to sell your company instead of solving their problem.

## Use a clear 4-part structure in every major section

Every significant response in your tender should clearly answer **four questions**, in this order:

### 1. What is the customer trying to solve?

Demonstrate a clear understanding of the customer’s issues, constraints, and objectives.

* Use the language from their tender documents
* Reflect their industry, environment, and operating context
* Show that this response was written specifically for them

This reassures the evaluator that you “get it”.

### 2. How does your solution address that issue?

Describe your approach **in direct relation to the customer’s needs**.

* Explain what you will do
* Explain how you will do it
* Explain why this approach fits their organisation

Avoid generic solution descriptions that could apply to any customer.

### 3. What benefit does this deliver to the customer?

Explicitly link your solution to outcomes the customer values.

Examples include:

* Reduced delivery or operational risk
* Improved efficiency or governance
* Faster time to value
* Better user experience
* Lower total cost of ownership

Never assume the benefit is obvious. Spell it out.

### 4. How can you prove it?

Claims without proof weaken credibility. Evaluators are trained to look for evidence.

Back up your statements with:

* Relevant case studies (named or anonymised)
* Quantified results
* Client references or testimonials
* Experience delivering similar scope or complexity
* Demonstrated success in comparable environments

Proof builds trust.

## Why this structure works

Using this structure consistently delivers three major benefits:

* Easier to score – Evaluators can clearly see understanding, solution, benefit, and proof
* Easier to read – Responses are focused and don’t waffle
* More persuasive – Evidence-backed arguments are far more compelling

## Write for the specific customer, not a generic audience

Evaluators can immediately spot content copied from a master document and lightly edited.

Strong tender responses are tailored by:

* Referencing the customer’s industry and challenges
* Reflecting the language and priorities used in their tender
* Addressing known risks or sensitivities
* Demonstrating familiarity with their environment where appropriate

Generic language signals low effort and low relevance.

## Make your win themes and value propositions clear

Winning tenders reinforce a small number of consistent messages throughout the document. These are your ["win themes"](/do-you-define-win-strategies-and-win-themes)! The clear reasons why this customer should choose you over every other bidder.

Strong win themes are:

* Relevant to the customer’s needs
* Supported by evidence
* Repeated consistently across sections

Avoid vague claims like “We are best in class”, “industry leading”, or “innovative” unless you clearly explain what that means in practice.

Value propositions should always link directly to customer outcomes, not internal capabilities.

It is important to remember: large tender submissions are usually assessed by multiple evaluators. Even if a question has been addressed elsewhere, it should be answered again in full, using fresh wording rather than copy and paste. Each evaluator should be able to clearly understand your offering within their allocated section, without needing to search for it elsewhere in the response.

## Use evidence, not assertions

Whenever you make a claim, ask yourself:

* Can we prove this?
* Have we done this before?
* Can we reference a client?
