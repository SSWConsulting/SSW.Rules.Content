<introEmbed
  body={<>
Code becomes easier to understand when names align closely with their meaning. Since classes represent things, they should use nouns. Methods, on the other hand, represent actions and should be named using verbs. A method named Person, for example, could easily confuse your team by suggesting an entity rather than an action.

## What is a verb?

A verb is a word that describes an action or process—something that’s done. Examples include **walk**, **run**, **think**, **listen**, and **breathe**, as well as **process**, **calculate**, **send**, and **save**.

## Naming methods as verbs

While your method names shouldn’t all be single verbs (since that’s often too vague), they should be verb-based, using a verb as the foundation of their meaning.
