GitHub notifications can be frustrating if they are not setup for your personal preferences. For example, you may not want to receive an email everytime an automated GitHub action runs against the repo. To configure how many and how you receive your GitHub notifications follow this process.

<endIntro />

1. From [GitHub](https://www.github.com) **Profile Dropdown | Settings | Notifications**

  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure="First navigate to your notifications"

/>


2. Customise the settings as you see fit
