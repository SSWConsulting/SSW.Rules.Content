ChatGPT is an incredibly powerful tool. GPT-4 is a noticeable improvement over GPT-3.5, and we can only expect the subsequent models to be even more impressive. For now, it does have its skills and weaknesses.

Here are the most important things for which we know it to be useful (and not):
## ‚úÖ Use it for

### 1. Writing

It can draft emails, reports, proposals, writing projects, and templates, as well as proofread and edit documents.

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    "Please help me draft an email to my team about an upcoming project deadline."
"Can you proofread and edit this short report on the effects of climate change?"
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

### 2. Summarization

It can create concise summaries of meetings or lengthy documents/text.

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    "Summarize the key points from this article about the latest advances in renewable energy."
"Provide a summary of the main ideas discussed in this meeting transcript."
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

### 3. Coding

It can assist with coding tasks by offering suggestions, debugging code, generating code snippets, and providing explanations for programming concepts.

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    "I have this Python code with a syntax error, can you help me debug and fix the issue?"\
"How do I create a simple function to calculate the factorial of a number in JavaScript?"
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

### 4. Creativity

It can generate new ideas, offer creative suggestions, and provide guidance on resolving conflicts or addressing challenging situations.

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    "Suggest some innovative ideas for a sustainable urban transportation system."
"Give me 20 ideas for what I should do my next software blog about."
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

### 5. Content

It can generate engaging content for various platforms, including social media, presentations, etc.

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    "Create a catchy social media post to promote our upcoming product launch."
"Design an engaging PowerPoint slide to present our company's quarterly performance."
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

### 6. Critiquing

It can provide constructive feedback on various forms of work (in text format only), such as writing, presentations, and code.

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    "Please review this essay on the history of artificial intelligence and provide feedback on its structure, clarity, and overall quality."
"Please assess this business proposal for a new startup, focusing on its feasibility, potential risks, and growth opportunities."
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

### 7. Learning

It can provide resources, explanations, and tutorials on almost any topic.

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    "Explain the basics of quantum computing and suggest some resources for further learning."
"How can I learn to play the guitar? Please provide a tutorial or some beginner tips."
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

### 8. Research

It can gather information on various topics, analyze data, conduct SWOT and competitive analyses, and weigh pros and cons of different options.

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    "Conduct a SWOT analysis for Tesla and identify its main competitors in the electric vehicle market."
"What are the pros and cons of using solar power as a renewable energy source?"
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

### 9. Translation

It can help in translating text between languages, providing quick and reasonably accurate translations for both personal and professional use.

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    "Translate the following English text to French: 'Hello, my name is John, and I will be your tour guide today.'"
"Translate this German sentence into English: 'Das Wetter ist heute sehr sch√∂n.'"
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

And there are also areas where it performs poorly.

## ‚ùå Dont use it for

### 1. Non-textual information

It is not designed to process or generate images, audio, or other non-textual information.

### 2. Mathematics

While it can handle basic arithmetic and some mathematical concepts, it is not designed for advanced or complex mathematical problem-solving.

### 3. Emotion and empathy

It can mimic emotions, but it doesn't truly experience or understand them, which can lead to inappropriate or tone-deaf responses.

### 4. Context understanding

It may struggle with understanding context and maintaining continuity when a conversation gets long. ü§ñ
