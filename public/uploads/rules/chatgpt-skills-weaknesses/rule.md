ChatGPT is an incredibly powerful tool. GPT-4 is a noticeable improvement over GPT-3.5, and we can only expect the subsequent models to be even more impressive. For now, it does have its skills and weaknesses.

Here are the most important things for which we know it to be useful (and not):

"Provide a summary of the main ideas discussed in this meeting transcript."
:::

### 3. Coding

It can assist with coding tasks by offering suggestions, debugging code, generating code snippets, and providing explanations for programming concepts.

::: greybox
"I have this Python code with a syntax error, can you help me debug and fix the issue?"\
"How do I create a simple function to calculate the factorial of a number in JavaScript?"
:::

### 4. Creativity

It can generate new ideas, offer creative suggestions, and provide guidance on resolving conflicts or addressing challenging situations.

### 6. Critiquing

:::

### 7. Learning

"How can I learn to play the guitar? Please provide a tutorial or some beginner tips."

### 8. Research

It can gather information on various topics, analyze data, conduct SWOT and competitive analyses, and weigh pros and cons of different options.

::: greybox
"Conduct a SWOT analysis for Tesla and identify its main competitors in the electric vehicle market."

:::

### 9. Translation

:::

And there are also areas where it performs poorly.

## ‚ùå Dont use it for

### 1. Non-textual information

It is not designed to process or generate images, audio, or other non-textual information.

### 2. Mathematics

While it can handle basic arithmetic and some mathematical concepts, it is not designed for advanced or complex mathematical problem-solving.

### 3. Emotion and empathy

It can mimic emotions, but it doesn't truly experience or understand them, which can lead to inappropriate or tone-deaf responses.

### 4. Context understanding

It may struggle with understanding context and maintaining continuity when a conversation gets long. ü§ñ
