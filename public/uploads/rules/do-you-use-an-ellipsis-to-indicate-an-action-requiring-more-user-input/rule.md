In menus (including context menus) or buttons, there are generally two types of actions:

1. ones that carry out an action without any further user intervention upon clicking;
2. and those that require further user input before the action is carried out

<!--endintro-->

Microsoft applications use this technique to indicate whether or not the action will be carried out without any further user intervention. Your application should also follow this well-established standard, so users will not be caught off guard when an action carried out immediately after they click the menu item.
