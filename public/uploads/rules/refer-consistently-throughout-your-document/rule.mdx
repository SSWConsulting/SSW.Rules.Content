The first example is bad because it confuses the reader as to whom the author is referring.

It is occasionally acceptable to use the first person, "we", "I", "us", "our" etc.
An example of an acceptable use of first person is: "We recommend that you backup your database first." **However, you must never use the first person to refer to the reader.**
