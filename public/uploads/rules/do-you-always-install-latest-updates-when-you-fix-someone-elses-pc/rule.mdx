When you fix someone else's PC (locally or remotely), one of the best practices is always make sure it has the latest updates.
  </>}
/>
- To achieve this, we run Windows Update and install all latest updates.

  figure: "![Here are some updates that need to be applied](/uploads/rules/do-you-always-install-latest-updates-when-you-fix-someone-elses-pc/2021-04-20_11-50-38.png)",

} } />


Warning: Of course if you are fixing a bug on someoneâ€™s PC, you should only update one piece of software at a time, so you know if an update fixes the problem. After that (if the company allows it), update all software to the latest version. If they get a new problem, then rollback.
