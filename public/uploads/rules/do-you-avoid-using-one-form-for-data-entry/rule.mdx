seoDescription: Avoid combining data entry and find navigation on a single form, as
  it can lead to confusion. Instead, use two forms - one for list views with "Add",
  "Edit", and "Delete" buttons, and another for data entry fields.

Combining data entry and find navigation is a mistake. I think 2 forms are better than one. I prefer a list box on one form with "Add", "Edit" and "Delete" buttons to a popup form. Rather than a listbox and the data entry fields on one form.

When you want to create a new entry or edit one, just click the buttons and open a new form with all the data entry fields.
