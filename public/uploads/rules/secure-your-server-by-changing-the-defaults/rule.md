1. Disable defaults
   - Disable Administrator and Rename it, then create a new "honeypot" Administrator account with no permissions.
   - Disable Guest on the SQL
   - Change Port 1433
   - Delete the sample databases - (AdventureWorks, Northwind and Pubs). These have a Public Role which is a security risk and allow Massive SQL Statements
2. Other security issues
   - Use a service account with a strong password
   - Do not run SQL Server service as an administrator
   - Run in integrated security mode
   - Run on NTFS file system - Encrypt the data files
