  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Access team usage from \"Team Settings\" | \"Manage Team\" | \"Analytics\"",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }

### Tenant Usage

This is by far the most interesting and import report. You need special (tenant-level) permissions to access those [usage reports](https://admin.microsoft.com/?source=applauncher#/reportsUsage/TeamsUserActivityV1).

  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Access tenant level usage via \"Office 365 Admin Center\" | \"Reports\" | \"Usage\" | \"View More\" (under Microsoft Teams activity section)",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/teams-usage/teams-tenant-usage.jpg"
