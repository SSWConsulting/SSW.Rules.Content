Usage analytics is quite important - it allows you to identify popular and unused teams, and helps figuring out Microsoft Teams adoption across your business (i.e. How many meetings? How many chats? etc...)

There are 2 places to check for usage reports in Teams:

### Team Usage

  caption={"Access team usage from \"Team Settings\" | \"Manage Team\" | \"Analytics\""}
  src="/uploads/rules/teams-usage/teams-team-usage.jpg"
/>


### Tenant Usage

This is by far the most interesting and import report. You need special (tenant-level) permissions to access those [usage reports](https://admin.microsoft.com/?source=applauncher#/reportsUsage/TeamsUserActivityV1).

  caption={"Access tenant level usage via \"Office 365 Admin Center\" | \"Reports\" | \"Usage\" | \"View More\" (under Microsoft Teams activity section)"}
  src="/uploads/rules/teams-usage/teams-tenant-usage.jpg"
/>


Now enjoy the full power of Teams usage analytics!

    **Important:** If you can't see users logins such but GUIDs instead, you will need some SysAdmin magic to make it happen. Simply follow these steps: [Show user details in the reports](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-AU/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/activity-reports?view=o365-worldwide#show-user-details-in-the-reports&WT.mc_id=M365-MVP-33518)
