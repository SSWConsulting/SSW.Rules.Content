It always much better for your developers to find errors rather than your clients and end-users. ASP.NET 2.0 has precompilation built-in. However, you can perform similar validation in ASP.NET 1.1 as well.
For more information go to **Precompile ASP.NET Sample in SSW Knowledge Base** (broken link removed).
