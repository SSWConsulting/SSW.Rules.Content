Most people don’t manage their inbox effectively. Emails should be treated as a list to do. As you complete a task you can just delete the email.
  </>}
/>
Your inbox should only contain ['tasks'](/dones-do-you-use-email-for-tasks-only-not-communication), that are actionable items on your **list of things to do**. Everything that is in your 'Inbox' (including sub-folders) should only be to-do items.

So do it now, delete all emails you have done. If you want to keep some for reference, move them to a new folder that is not in your inbox.

    shouldDisplay: true
  }}

/>

In fact, you could go so far as to say you should not do anything unless you have an email telling you to do it (which is why we [send ourselves emails](/dones-do-you-send-yourself-emails)). In rare cases, very simple tasks can be requested and replied 'done' via [IM](/rules-to-better-im).
