seoDescription: When planning to use Workflow, consider using it with SharePoint List
  instead of BCS, as Workflow doesn't support external lists and requires data storage
  in SharePoint.

If you are planning to use Workflow, use Workflow with SharePoint List instead of BCS. Because Workflow cannot be associated directly with external lists. The reason is data is not stored in SharePoint, so the Workflow cannot be notified when items change.
