An ergonomic setup ensures that you are using your computer in a way that will not injure or strain you in any way. As you will likely be sitting/standing at your desk for up to 8 hours it is crucial to not become complacent with the layout of your desk.

Tips to remember when reviewing your desk:

- Eyes should be level with the top of the screen
- Eyes should be an arms length away from the screen
- Upper legs should be parallel to the ground
- Feet should be either flat on the ground or on a slightly angled foot rest
- Shoulders and arms should be parallel to the ground
- Lower back should have support
- You should be able to comfortably sit up straight
