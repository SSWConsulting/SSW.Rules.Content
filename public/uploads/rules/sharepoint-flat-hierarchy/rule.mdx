In the days of classic SharePoint, subsites were a popular way of organising your intranet. Modern SharePoint architecture leans toward a flatter hierarchy, where sub-sites are generally not recommended.

There are several reasons why sub-sites are no longer recommended. [Callum Crowley talks about some of the important benefits of a flat hierarchy](https://callum.foo/2021/05/still-using-subsites-in-sharepoint-online-5-reasons-to-move-to-flat-architecture), including:

**Flexibility** – Sub-sites are a pain to move - you'll never need to do this with a flat hierarchy. Using Hub sites, it’s easy to change links and use dynamic content to make sure your SharePoint architecture matches your organisational structure.

**Microsoft Teams & 365 Groups** – Every Microsoft Team you create has its own SharePoint site, and SharePoint integrates with Microsoft 365 groups. So with a flat hierarchy, users and admins have a consistent experience across apps and Document Libraries.

It is worth noting that this flexibility comes at a cost - permissions can be more difficult to manage, as each site will need permissions set separately, and you cannot use nested groups.
