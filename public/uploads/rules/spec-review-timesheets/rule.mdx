When entering timesheets against a client for a Spec Review, you should always create a separate project so that this time does not pollute the data for the total project costs.

<endOfIntro />

When a client asks how you are tracking against an estimate, this is always the post-Spec Review estimate and so should be compared to the post Spec Review costs.

The naming convention should be "&#123;&#123; PROJECT NAME &#125;&#125; - Spec Review".
