The word **emotional** often carries a negative or unstable tone — it can imply being overwhelmed, irrational, or easily upset. In contrast, **passionate** conveys energy, dedication, and positive intensity.
  </>}
/>
When describing someone’s drive, interest, or commitment, use **passionate** instead of **emotional** to avoid unintended negative connotations. It helps to:

* Keeping your tone professional and uplifting
* Highlighting strength and enthusiasm instead of vulnerability
* Improving clarity and avoids misunderstandings
