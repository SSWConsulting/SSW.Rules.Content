Transitioning a project smoothly is crucial, whether due to changing project assignments or planned absences. A [thorough handover process](/handover-best-practices) ensures continuity and minimizes disruption.

**The handover is the responsibility of the person transitioning away from the project.**

It's essential to initiate the handover planning as soon as a transition is known. Review the project with the selected team member who will take over, then schedule a handover meeting with high priority.

It's important to plan from the perspective of the person receiving the handover.

**Tip:** If you are leaving a company, ideally your handover should be done **as soon as possible** so that the developer taking over can start working on them while you’re still available to answer any questions.

3. Scrum - Review [Definition of Done](/definition-of-done) and [Definition of Ready](/have-a-definition-of-ready)
4. Discuss project roles
   1. Who is the Product Owner?
   2. Who is the Scrum Master?
   3. Any other important stakeholders?
5. Architecture and Code Review
   1. Look for any [Tech Debt](/technical-debt)
   2. Test coverage and quality
6. CI/CD - Overview of the pipelines and deployment process
7. Overview of monitoring, logging, and incident response procedures
8. Project access - Ensure the new team member has all necessary permissions

    **Tip:** Recording the handover process via a Teams call can be beneficial for future reference.

Even better at the end of a long call record a quick summary so everybody knows what was agreed. And it's easier for other people to watch.
