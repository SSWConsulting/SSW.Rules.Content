Transitioning a project smoothly is crucial, whether due to changing project assignments or planned absences. A [thorough handover process](/handover-best-practices) ensures continuity and minimizes disruption.

**The handover is the responsibility of the person transitioning away from the project.**

It's essential to initiate the handover planning as soon as a transition is known. Review the project with the selected team member who will take over, then schedule a handover meeting with high priority.

It's important to plan from the perspective of the person receiving the handover.

**Tip:** If you are leaving a company, ideally your handover should be done **as soon as possible** so that the developer taking over can start working on them while you’re still available to answer any questions.

    **Tip:** Recording the handover process via a Teams call can be beneficial for future reference.

Even better at the end of a long call record a quick summary so everybody knows what was agreed. And it's easier for other people to watch.
