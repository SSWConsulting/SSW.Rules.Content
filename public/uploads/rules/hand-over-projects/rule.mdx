Transitioning a project smoothly is crucial, whether due to changing project assignments or planned absences. A [thorough handover process](/handover-best-practices) ensures continuity and minimizes disruption.

**The handover is the responsibility of the person transitioning away from the project.**

It's essential to initiate the handover planning as soon as a transition is known. Review the project with the selected team member who will take over, then schedule a handover meeting with high priority.

It's important to plan from the perspective of the person receiving the handover.

**Tip:** If you are leaving a company, ideally your handover should be done **as soon as possible** so that the developer taking over can start working on them while you’re still available to answer any questions.

I am looking forward to our upcoming handover meeting for &#123;&#123; PROJECT NAME &#125;&#125;. Please find below the checklist to go through:

1. [Record this meeting](/record-teams-meetings) - It could be useful later!
2. Review the roadmap/backlog - What are the current and upcoming goals?
3. Scrum - Review [Definition of Done](/definition-of-done) and [Definition of Ready](/have-a-definition-of-ready)
4. Discuss project roles
   1. Who is the Product Owner?
   2. Who is the Scrum Master?
   3. Any other important stakeholders?
5. Architecture and Code Review
   1. Look for any [Tech Debt](/technical-debt)
   2. Test coverage and quality
6. CI/CD - Overview of the pipelines and deployment process
7. Overview of monitoring, logging, and incident response procedures
8. Project access - Ensure the new team member has all necessary permissions
9. Documentation - Review and update any missing or outdated documentation
10. Optional - Shadow some project meetings and development

We will record the meeting for future reference and add it to the project documentation. Please be ready to discuss these points, and let me know if you have any questions before the meeting.

Thanks!

    **Tip:** Recording the handover process via a Teams call can be beneficial for future reference.

Even better at the end of a long call record a quick summary so everybody knows what was agreed. And it's easier for other people to watch.
