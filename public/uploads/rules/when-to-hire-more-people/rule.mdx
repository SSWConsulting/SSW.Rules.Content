In a consulting company, you're always balancing having either not enough work or too much. When you're approaching full capacity (i.e. full utilization), either overall or in a particular skill niche, you should make sure you get approval to hire more people.

When you do this, make sure you show your evidence so it's not just a gut feel.

    ## Hi Bob

As per our conversation, we need more developers. I just lost 3 months of work (full-stack, React + .NET).

1. Please approve recruiting and hiring more devs ASAP

For more proof, check out our current bookings:
