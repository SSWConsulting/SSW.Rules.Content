Any opportunity that has not yet been converted to a sale will be at one of the following 6 stages:
  </>}
/>
1. **Initial Phone Call**
   * The client has made contact but no initial meeting has yet been made

2. **Initial Meeting** – Booked
   * You've arranged an initial meeting and it's booked in

3. **Follow Up Meeting** – Booked
   * In some cases, more than one initial meeting may be required before work or speccing commences

4. **Spec Review Proposal** – Waiting for approval
   * After the Initial Meeting, if the work requires it, a Specification Review is proposed

5. **Spec Review** – Booked
   * The specification phase has been approved and booked in

6. **Project Proposal** – Waiting for approval
   * After the Spec Review, the client has been given a proposal for a chunk of work. Once this is approved, the opportunity is closed as won

**Note:** The old Sales Pipeline was 9 steps, whereas this new one is 6 steps.
