Mobile device usage has been on the rise for years, driven by the increasing popularity and capabilities of smartphones and tablets. It's safe to say that, in the past years, the majority of internet users globally were accessing websites through **mobile** devices.

Therefore, it is very important to hyperlink your phone number to increase the rate of conversion and improve the mobile user experience. This enables click and call, and eliminates the need to copy and paste phone numbers.

Devices and computers that don’t have phone functionality will either open a phone app or add the number to a contact list.

```html
<a href="tel:+61299533000">+61 2 9953 3000</a>
```

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {

  figure: "Figure: Good example – To make a telephone number clickable, use add a link with \"tel:\" inside the href attribute",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />
