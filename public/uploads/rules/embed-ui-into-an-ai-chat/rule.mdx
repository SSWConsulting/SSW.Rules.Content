### Benefits of Embedding UI into AI Chat

Embedding UI elements in AI chats can:

* Simplify complex interactions by providing users with intuitive options.
* Enhance data collection through structured forms and inputs.
* Improve user experience with multimedia elements like images, videos, and interactive charts.
* Streamline navigation with quick-reply buttons and menus.

### Implementing UI Elements in AI Chats

One library that can help you embed UI elements in AI chats is [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introduction)

This SDK allows you to integrate AI into your chat applications through the use of React Server Components. Your LLM can stream UI directly to clients without the need for heavy JavaScript.

See here for a demo of the Vercel AI SDK in action: [Vercel AI SDK Demo](https://chat.vercel.ai/).
