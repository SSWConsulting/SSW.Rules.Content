**My Site** and **My Profile<** are great but if you are not using them, it makes sense to remove them:

    preset: "default",
    figure: "Links need to be hidden",

  } }

/>

You can follow below steps to hide “My Site” and “My Profile”. There are a few options, based on what you need to do:

### Delete the association (not recommended)

1. Going to **Central Admin | Application Management | Service Applications | Configure service application associations**, and choose “default” link:

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: "Bad example - Choose “default” link",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-remove-my-site-and-my-profile-if-you-are-not-using-them/RemoveAssociation.png"
/>

2. Uncheck the “User Profile Service Application” in the opened page, then click “OK”:

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: "Bad example - Uncheck the association for \"User Profile Service\"",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-remove-my-site-and-my-profile-if-you-are-not-using-them/RemoveAssociation2.png"
/>

### Customize permissions for only some people to have access to create personal site

You can remove it for most people - but leave it for only some users.

1. Go to **Central Admin | Application Management | Service Applications | Manage service applications**, and click the link of “User Profile Service Application”, navigate to its manage page:

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "okExample",
    figure: "OK example - “User Profile Service Application” manage page",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-remove-my-site-and-my-profile-if-you-are-not-using-them/UserProfileServiceManagePage.png"
/>

2. Click **People | Manage User Permissions**, you can customize the user profile permission for specific users:

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "okExample",
    figure: "OK example - Customize \"User Profile Permissions\"",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-remove-my-site-and-my-profile-if-you-are-not-using-them/CustomUserProfileServicePermission.png"
/>

### Delete the service (recommended if you don't need the service at all in your farm)

**Note:** You can always create it later if you need it in the future.

1. Go to **Central Admin | Application Management | Service Applications | Manage service applications**, and select “User Profile Service Application”, then click the “Delete” button on the ribbon:

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good example - Delete \"User Profile Service\"",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-remove-my-site-and-my-profile-if-you-are-not-using-them/DeleteUserProfileService.png"
/>

    **Note:** Later on if you want to get My Site working read these 2 links... unless Microsoft creates a services that fixes User Profile Synchronization service. Thanks to Mark Rhodes for these tips:
