Prompts are the instructions that you input. They can be as simple or as complex as you like.

## Prompting basics

A general prompt might be "an image of a sunset over the ocean," which tells the AI exactly what you're looking for.

  body={<>
    Tip: When sharing an AI image, [add the prompt to the image caption](/add-useful-and-concise-figure-captions) so others can see how you made it.
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    “A brown dog on a skateboard”
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good example - A basic prompt",
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
/>

A well-structured prompt often has more details, in the format “A &#123;&#123; TYPE OF PICTURE &#125;&#125; of a &#123;&#123; MAIN SUBJECT &#125;&#125;, &#123;&#123; STYLE CUES &#125;&#125;”.

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    “A photograph of a robot, cartoon style”
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good example - A basic prompt with style cues.",
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
/>

You can add more even more detail to make a descriptive prompt by following this template:

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    **&#123;&#123; ADJECTIVE &#125;&#125;, &#123;&#123; EMOTION &#125;&#125;, &#123;&#123; SUBJECT &#125;&#125;, &#123;&#123; STYLE &#125;&#125;, &#123;&#123; COLOR &#125;&#125;**
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good example - Use this prompt template!",
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
/>

## Prompt length

Prompts that are too short do not give the AI enough information to create an image matching your idea. It is a good idea to be detailed with your prompts, but too much detail is equally likely to give the AI too many instructions, which "confuses" it and can reduce the acurracy.

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    "A landscape"
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Figure: Bad example - A vague prompt like this gives an ambiguous image",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    "A snowy mountain landscape at sunset with warm hues in the style of a photograph"
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "Figure: Good example - A detailed and concise description, but not too long. This will provide the AI with specific elements to incorporate, resulting in an accurate image.",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    "A snowy mountain landscape at sunset... Majestic peaks rise high into the sky, their rugged outlines etched against the fading golden light. Adorned with a pristine layer of glistening snow, they stand as silent sentinels, towering over the vast expanse below. The snow-covered slopes cascade down in gentle curves, inviting adventurers and nature lovers alike. In the foreground, a small creek meanders through the snow-covered landscape, flowing steadily beneath a delicate layer of ice. Over the creek, a footbridge stretches, connecting the two banks. Two travelers cross the bridge, their footprints leaving a mark on the pristine snow. The frozen trees, adorned with icicles, stand like witnesses to the passage of time."
