  body={<>
SQL Server stores vital error and performance information in several different logs. You should be aware of all of them:

1. SQL Server Error Logs
   - Configure how many you want to keep
   - You should Back up your SQL Server error logs with your other scripts
   - Sp_cycle_errorlog
2. SQL Server Agent Error Log
   - Recycles after every service restart
3. Job History Logs
   - Agent properties, Job System tab
   - Probably too low by default
4. DBMaint history logs
5. (Event Viewer) - Issues
