In Outlook the Street Address is stored as 1 Multi-Line field (with an intelligent Address Checker - nice but not essential), yet in Microsoft CRM the Street Address is split out across 3 separate single line text fields, they should be consistent.

We consider Outlook is friendlier, because:

1. The wrong data is entered often when you have Street 1, Street 2, Street 3.
2. Often Street 2 and Street 3 is not needed so it is extra clutter for no reason.
3. What do you do when you have Street 4.
4. It is the same as
   [http://local.live.com/](http://www.ssw.com.au/SSW/Redirect/Live.htm)

Of course, we might be wrong, because:

1. Basically, it's not worth the effort - because it goes across multiple places in CRM like Leads and Opportunity (see test results from Adrian).
2. Printing labels might be simpler - sizes would be fixed.

We have a suggestion for CRM about this at [CRM and Outlook should be consistent with regards to Addresses.](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/BetterSoftwareSuggestions/CRM.aspx#AddressConsistent)
