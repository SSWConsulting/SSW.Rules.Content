**Question:** What is wrong with this Picture?

![Figure: Can you tell what is wrong with this Picture?](../../assets/ShowInTaskBar.jpg)

<!--endintro-->

**Answer:** The 2 SSW SQL Auditor windows are bad, because one is just a modal form.

::: info
**Note:** We don't check for this in Code Auditor because making a form display as popup, is done at runtime via the ShowDialog method.
:::

```vbnet
Dim frm as new frmCustomer frm.ShowDialog
```

::: bad
Figure: Bad Code
:::

If your form is designed to be used modally (and thus be called using ShowDialog) then ShowInTaskbar should be set to false in the form designer.

```vbnet
Dim frm as new frmCustomer frm.ShowInTaskBar = False frm.ShowDialog
```

::: bad
Figure: Bad Code (because this should be set in the form designer)
:::

```vbnet
Dim frm as new frmCustomer frm.ShowDialog
```

::: good
Figure: Good Code (ShowInTaskbar is set in the form's InitializeComponents method instead)
