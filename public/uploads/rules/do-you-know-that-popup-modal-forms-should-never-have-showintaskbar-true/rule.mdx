**Question:** What is wrong with this Picture?


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Can you tell what is wrong with this Picture?",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-that-popup-modal-forms-should-never-have-showintaskbar-true/ShowInTaskBar.jpg"
/>

**Answer:** The 2 SSW SQL Auditor windows are bad, because one is just a modal form.


<asideEmbed
  variant="info"
  body={<>
    **Note:** We don't check for this in Code Auditor because making a form display as popup, is done at runtime via the ShowDialog method.
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>


```vbnet
Dim frm as new frmCustomer frm.ShowDialog
```
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Figure: Bad Code",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


If your form is designed to be used modally (and thus be called using ShowDialog) then ShowInTaskbar should be set to false in the form designer.

```vbnet
Dim frm as new frmCustomer frm.ShowInTaskBar = False frm.ShowDialog
```
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Figure: Bad Code (because this should be set in the form designer)",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


```vbnet
Dim frm as new frmCustomer frm.ShowDialog
```
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "Figure: Good Code (ShowInTaskbar is set in the form's InitializeComponents method instead)",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />
