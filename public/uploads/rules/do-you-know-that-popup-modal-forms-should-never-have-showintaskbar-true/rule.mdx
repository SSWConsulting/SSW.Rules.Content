**Question:** What is wrong with this Picture?

**Answer:** The 2 SSW SQL Auditor windows are bad, because one is just a modal form.


<boxEmbed
  style="info"
  body={<>
    **Note:** We don't check for this in Code Auditor because making a form display as popup, is done at runtime via the ShowDialog method.
  </>}

```vbnet
Dim frm as new frmCustomer frm.ShowDialog
```
**❌ Figure: Bad Code**  

If your form is designed to be used modally (and thus be called using ShowDialog) then ShowInTaskbar should be set to false in the form designer.

```vbnet
Dim frm as new frmCustomer frm.ShowInTaskBar = False frm.ShowDialog
```
**❌ Figure: Bad Code (because this should be set in the form designer)**  

```vbnet
Dim frm as new frmCustomer frm.ShowDialog
```
**✅ Figure: Good Code (ShowInTaskbar is set in the form's InitializeComponents method instead)**
