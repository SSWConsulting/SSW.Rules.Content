**Answer:** The 2 SSW SQL Auditor windows are bad, because one is just a modal form.

    **Note:** We don't check for this in Code Auditor because making a form display as popup, is done at runtime via the ShowDialog method.

If your form is designed to be used modally (and thus be called using ShowDialog) then ShowInTaskbar should be set to false in the form designer.

```vbnet
Dim frm as new frmCustomer frm.ShowInTaskBar = False frm.ShowDialog
```
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Figure: Bad Code (because this should be set in the form designer)",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


```vbnet
Dim frm as new frmCustomer frm.ShowDialog
```
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "Figure: Good Code (ShowInTaskbar is set in the form's InitializeComponents method instead)",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />
