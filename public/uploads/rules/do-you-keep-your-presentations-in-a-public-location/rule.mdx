Most companies keep their presentations on an internal resource (e.g. SharePoint, or these days more likely "Teams | Files") and there is still a place for that (especially if you don't want to share it).

The best place for presentations (PPT) and other resources such as PDFs or a bunch of URLs is in a public location. The best public location is GitHub.

Did you know that if you keep your PowerPoint presentations in a public location, it makes it easier for your attendees to access later?
