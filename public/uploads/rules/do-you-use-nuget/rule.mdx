seoDescription: Easy NuGet package management simplifies third-party library installation
  and upgrading in Visual Studio projects.

NuGet allows you to search for, install, upgrade, configure and remove 3rd party libraries from Visual Studio projects in a consistent and easy to use manner.

<endIntro />

NuGet makes it easy to manage 3rd party libraries in your projects by keeping track of the library and the files needed to make it work with the concept of a package.

The package contains all the information needed for the 3rd party library to work with your project including any dependencies it may require.

The concept of a package makes it very easy to upgrade and remove the libraries in the future with a single click.

Now all you need to do when you want to remove or upgrade the package is go back to the NuGet package manager.
