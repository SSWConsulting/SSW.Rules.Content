The reason is that you avoid ownership chain problems. Where Mary owns an object, Fred can read the object and then he creates a proc and he gives permission to Tom to execute. But Tom cannot because there is a product chain of ownership.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE [Adam Cogan].[Sales by Year]

@Beginning_Date DateTime,

@Ending_Date DateTime AS

SELECT Orders.ShippedDate

,Orders.OrderID

,"vwOrderSubTotals".Subtotal

,DATENAME(yy,ShippedDate) AS Year

FROM Orders

INNER JOIN "vwOrderSubTotals"

ON Orders.OrderID = "vwOrderSubTotals".OrderID

WHERE Orders.ShippedDate Between @Beginning_Date And @Ending_Date
```
