seoDescription: Consistently manage cluster node settings using group policy to ensure
  uniformity across all nodes.
title: Do you use group policy to apply settings to all of your cluster nodes?

Don't log in and make manual changes to the clustered nodes.

When working with clustered environments it is important that settings be consistent across every node. The best way to handle this is through group policy.

<endOfIntro />

Create a policy that you would like applied to each node of the cluster using the **Group Policy Management** .
