seoDescription: Schema simplification boosts readability and maintainability, making
  it unnecessary to use user-schema separation unless dealing with very large databases.
title: Schema - Do you avoid using user-schema separation?

<introEmbed
  body={<>
User-schema separation allows more flexibility by adding another level of naming and shifting ownership of database objects to the schema, not the user. So, is it worth doing? Unless you are working with a very large database (100+ tables), the answer is "no". Most smaller databases have all objects with owner "dbo", which is fine in most cases.
