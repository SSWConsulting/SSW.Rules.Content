User-schema separation allows more flexibility by adding another level of naming and shifting ownership of database objects to the schema, not the user. So, is it worth doing? Unless you are working with a very large database (100+ tables), the answer is "no". Most smaller databases have all objects with owner "dbo", which is fine in most cases.
