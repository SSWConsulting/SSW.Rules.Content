When you run into a wall in Power BI and feel like you've exhausted the out of the box functionality, that when it's time to investigate what a bit of DAX can do for you.

<endIntro />

There are 2 different things you can do with DAX, create a Measure or a Calculated Column.

Calculated columns:

- Stored in the database
- Often used to filter/group data

Measures:

- Computed on aggregates of values
- Computed at query time
- Often used to give a numerical metric

```dax
GroupingColumn = if (value<x, small, if(value<y, medium, large))
```
