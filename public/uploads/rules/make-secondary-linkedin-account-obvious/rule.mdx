If you’re working with LinkedIn Talent Hub solutions and don’t want to use your primary LinkedIn account, you will need to create a second one. The issue is that the secondary account will show up when people search for your name:
  </>}
/>

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: "Bad example - Bryden Oliver showing twice on LinkedIn Search",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/make-secondary-linkedin-account-obvious/linkedin-secondary-profile.png"
/>


Unfortunately there is no way to disable/hide your secondary profile if it is associated with Talent Hub:


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "LinkedIn doesn’t let you disable/hibernate an account that has a Recruiter License",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/make-secondary-linkedin-account-obvious/linkedin-unable-hibernate.png"
/>


The only workaround is to make your secondary account more obvious by adding a clear description:

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good example - Secondary account clearly states that this is a 'Recruitment account' and is not current",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/make-secondary-linkedin-account-obvious/linkedin-clear-second-account.png"
/>
