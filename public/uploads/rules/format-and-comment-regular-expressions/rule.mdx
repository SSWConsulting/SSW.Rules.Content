Regular expressions are a very powerful tool for pattern matching, but a complicated regex can be very difficult for a human to read and to comprehend. That is why, like any good code, a good regular expression must be well formatted and documented.

Here are some guidelines when formatting and documenting your regex:

* Keep each line under 80 characters, horizontal scrolling reduces readability
* Break long patterns into multiple lines, usually after a space or a line break
* Indent bracers to help think in the right scope
* Format complicated OR patterns into multiple blocks like a case statement
* Comment your regex on what it does, don't just translate it into English

```regex

# Match <BODY
<BODY
# Match any non > char for zero to infinite number of times
[^>]*
# MATCH >
>
```

```regex
# Match the BODY tag
<BODY
# Match any character in the body tag
[^>]*
# Match the end BODY tag
