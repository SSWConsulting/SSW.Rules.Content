According to the Scrum Alliance, "Scrum" is capitalized.

<!--endintro-->

You will occasionally see it written incorrectly:

❌ scrum - Not capitalized

❌ SCRUM - All caps (incorrect, as Scrum is not an acronym)

Other Scrum terms should also be capitalized:

* Sprint
* Product Owner
* Scrum Master
* Product Backlog
* Sprint Review
* Sprint Planning
* Sprint Retrospective
* Specification Review
* Spec Review
* Backlog Refinement
* Definition of Done
* Burn-down Chart
* Burn-up Chart
* Work Item
