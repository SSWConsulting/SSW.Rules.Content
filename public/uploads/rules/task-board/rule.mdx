Having an electronic task board makes it easy for developers to keep track of tasks.

These are the 3 columns (aka swim lanes) you need:

<endIntro />

* To do
* In progress
* Done

  figurePrefix="good"

Physical is OK too for small, co-located teams.

Near your task board, stick an SSW "Want to submit a User Story?"

* Where to find their project portal
* Who to contact with questions
* How to add tasks to the task board

[Print out this PDF](8StepstoScrum.pdf) and fill in the 2 fields and stick it on own task board.
