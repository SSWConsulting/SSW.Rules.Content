Having an electronic task board makes it easy for developers to keep track of tasks.

These are the 3 columns (aka swim lanes) you need:

<endOfIntro />

* To do
* In progress
* Done

  showBorder={false}
  captionStyle="goodExample"
  captionText={"Good example - a virtual client task board in action"}
  src="/uploads/rules/task-board/TFS Preview Task Board.png"
/>


Physical is OK too for small, co-located teams.

Near your task board, stick an SSW "Want to submit a User Story?"

* Where to find their project portal
* Who to contact with questions
* How to add tasks to the task board

[Print out this PDF](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Rules.Content/raw/main/rules/the-war-room-does-your-scrum-room-have-the-best-scrum-image/8StepstoScrum.pdf) and fill in the 2 fields and stick it on own task board.
