How you or your product speaks to users is integral to their experience and has notable impact.
Tone dictates how your content feels in digital spaces that lack face-to-face communication.
  </>}
/>
Tone of voice is everywhere in UX and content design, from hero banners to button text and error messages.
A casual tone on a corporate website may come across as unprofessional, while a formal voice on a social media can feel detached and unengaging.

## Know your audience

Knowing your audience is key to good design.
Who are your users? What are their expectations? How can you align with them?

Consider the following:

- **Demographics** - Analyze the demographics of your audience. E.g. age, gender, location, and cultural background
- **Psychographics** - Understand the values, beliefs, and preferences of your audience. Tailor your tone accordingly
- **Preferred channels** - Identify the spaces and tools your audience prefers and adapt to suit them

## Find the right voice

Think of your product or brand as a person. How does that person talk and act?

- **Formal vs Casual** - Official correspondence, or talking to a friend?
- **Serious vs Funny** - Solemn and stern, or fun and silly?
- **Respectful vs Irreverent** - Dictionary words, or cultural references and made-up phrases?
- **Matter-of-fact vs Enthusiastic** - Informative statements, or drama and hyperbole?

## Why tone matters

In [a UX study by the Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/tone-voice-users/) users gave feedback on 4 websites. They saw 2 versions of each site, where the only difference was tone of voice.
Users displayed clear preferences for each product. The right tone felt more credible and trustworthy - key measures of desirability.

The tone of voice that creates that feeling of trust will differ based on your specific audience and their concerns.
