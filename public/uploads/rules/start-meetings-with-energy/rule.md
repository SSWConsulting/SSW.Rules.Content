Waiting for participants to join a meeting can be awkward and make people feel disengaged. It's crucial for the meeting leader to maintain a positive and energetic atmosphere during this time to set the tone for the rest of the meeting.

* Avoid sitting silently or showing frustration about the wait
* Do not dive into the main agenda without the key participants present
* Avoid using filler time to discuss irrelevant or heavy topics that could disengage participants
* Do not use this time just to look at yourself in the camera view

Here are some tips to ensure meetings start with energy and engagement while waiting for attendees:

### 1. Have Filler Conversations

Engage with those who have already joined by discussing light topics, recent wins, or non-work-related subjects. This helps break the ice and keeps the atmosphere lively.

### 2. Acknowledge New Participants

When someone new joins, pause the current conversation to acknowledge them. It’s a simple yet effective way to make everyone feel included.

**Example:**

* In chat, type: “Waiting for Bob”
* Say: “Welcome Mary, just waiting for Bob. We are currently talking about the status of the backlog while waiting.”

### 3. Avoid Jumping into the Agenda

Starting the agenda too early can cause confusion for latecomers. Instead, use this time for informal discussions or to recap previous topics lightly.

### 4. Use Humor or Share Light Stories

A good laugh can make people more comfortable and open to participation. Share an interesting story or a fun fact to ease the waiting time.

### 5. Encourage Participation

Ask questions that prompt responses from those present. This can be something simple like “How was your weekend?” or “What’s one thing you’re excited about this week?”
