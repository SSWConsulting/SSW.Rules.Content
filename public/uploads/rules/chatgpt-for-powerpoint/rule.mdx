By now, you’ve probably realised that you can ask ChatGPT to create content for a PPT, which you can then copy and paste into PowerPoint, but this is still time consuming. The next level is to get it to then create the VBA script that can be run to generate the whole PPT 😀

Here’s a great prompt template for doing both! Feel free to play around with things like the preferred format or title colours.

### If you're on GPT-4 with Plugins

1. Select the [Smart Slides](https://www.whatplugin.ai/plugins/smart-slides) plugin from the plugin store


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    You are an expert presentation writer and PowerPoint expert.
Write a PowerPoint presentation on {TOPIC}.
Each slide should have a title.
The content on each slide should be in bullet point format.
Don't give me advice on what to talk about on each slide, instead give me the actual content I can use.

Target audience is business stakeholders with some technical background.
Make sure the objective or pain that is being worked on is clear.
Make sure the recommendations and next steps are clear.
End with a Q&A.

1st, ask for the {TOPIC}
Then, ask any relevant questions to get more context.

### If you're on GPT3 (or you want to add more custom specs)


<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    You are an expert presentation writer and PowerPoint expert.
Write a PowerPoint presentation on {TOPIC}.
Each slide should have a title that this is colour: RGB(204, 65, 65).
The content on each slide should be in bullet point format.
Don't give me advice on what to talk about on each slide, instead give me the actual content I can use.

Target audience is business stakeholders with some technical background.
Make sure the objective or pain that is being worked on is clear.
Make sure the recommendations and next steps are clear.
End with a Q&A.

Then create a VBA script to create the PPT including slide titles and all content on each slide.
Do not save the PPT.

1st, ask for the {TOPIC}
Then, ask any relevant questions to get more context.

4. Click Insert | Module
5. Paste your code into the text box and press F5 to run it
