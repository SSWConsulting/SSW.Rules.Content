seoDescription: iSCSI and Cluster networks should be isolated on their own VLAN or
  even better, their own switch to ensure secure data transfer.

  their own switch)?

Note: An even better and more expensive solution is purchase a separate Switch for each network (this example means 3 network adapters = 3 networks)
