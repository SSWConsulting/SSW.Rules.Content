Knowing when to use SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) over Power BI can ensure that you are using the tools most efficiently to help drive your business.

<endIntro />

Many organizations see Power BI as a replacement for SSRS due to a lack of major advancements in the SSRS space however while similar they both fill different key needs for organizations and the BI team at Microsoft has invested a lot of time into improving the SSRS offering.

SSRS is better for "Pixel perfect" reports that you can design exactly to your specifications, whereas most Power BI visualizations only have a finite amount of visual tinkering possible.

SSRS provides a stronger ability when it comes to static representational reports, like **invoices**, **monthly reports**, **mailing lists**...

Power BI however is better for a dynamic interrogation of data as it currently stands so this can allow power users to drill into live data to identify trends.

| Printing              | -        | ✅   |
| Mobile app            | ✅       | -    |
