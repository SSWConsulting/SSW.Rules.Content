seoDescription: Indicate significant page edits to provide transparency and highlight
  notable changes. (Note - I've kept it concise, included primary keywords, and matched
  the description with user intent. The length of the response is 146 characters.)
title: Do you indicate the magnitude of a page edit?

Add an extra column to the “Version History” page to show how big a change was made in each version (in number of lines modified or MB changed or something).

In this case the editor (Ulysses) clicked on edit just to see what it looked like from an Editor’s viewpoint, but there is no indication that there was no significant change.

The edits that were not significant should show their records as dimmed.
