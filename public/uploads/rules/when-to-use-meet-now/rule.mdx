## When to use "Meet Now"

* **Quick collaboration** - You need an immediate response or decision from a few people who are available
* **Unplanned discussions** - A short, impromptu discussion that cannot be resolved via chat
* **Co-working sessions** - When working together on a document or project and all team members are ready to engage

## Best practices for using "Meet Now"

* **Send a heads-up message** - Use a chat message to confirm if a quick call is appropriate
* **Set expectations** - Clarify the purpose and duration of the call in advance
* **Use scheduling for larger groups** - For large groups or in-depth discussions, use the "Schedule a Meeting" feature instead

By following these guidelines, you can make better use of the "Meet Now" button, ensuring your meetings are productive and respectful of everyone's time.
