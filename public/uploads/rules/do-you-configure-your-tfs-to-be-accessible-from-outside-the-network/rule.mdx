- TFS SP1
  This feature called "Extranet Support" was added way back in TFS 2005 SP1 as per [Stuff in the pipe for Team Foundation Server](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Redirect/StandardsRules/MSDNBlog.htm)
- A domain name or IP address forwarded to TFS (eg: tfs.your-domain.com)
- Port 8080 (this is port that TFS uses for source control)
- Firewall/Router rule (ideally)

<endOfIntro />

Tip: You can solve this with TFS Extranet Support:

Yes Port 8080 will work in most cases but not on the strictest networks, where only Port 80 is allowed.
Then you have to use port forwarding via a firewall/router rule (recommended) to forward port 80 to the TFS port, while in this way, you would lose the TFS SharePoint Portal and Reporting Services.
