When someone leaves a comment or GitHub Copilot creates a comment on your pull request, it's tempting to simply mark it as resolved and move on.
However, this creates confusion for other reviewers who can't tell if the suggestion was implemented, why it wasn't implemented, or what the outcome was.

Just like the "Reply Done" principle for emails, you should always provide a clear response to code review comments before resolving them.
This helps maintain transparency and ensures all reviewers understand the resolution.

<endIntro />

## Always respond before resolving

When you address a comment in your pull request, you should:

1. **For change requests**: Implement the change and reply "Done" or explain why it will not be implemented
2. **For questions**: Reply without resolving to allow conversation continuation

## Bad examples

<imageEmbed alt="Bad Example - Comment simply marked as resolved with no response" size="small" showBorder={false} figurePrefix="bad" figure="Comment simply marked as resolved with no response" src="/uploads/rules/do-you-properly-resolve-code-review-comments/Screenshot%202026-01-22%20165155.png" />

## Good examples

<imageEmbed alt="Image" size="small" showBorder={false} figurePrefix="good" figure="Clear confirmation that the change, as suggested, was implemented" src="/uploads/rules/do-you-properly-resolve-code-review-comments/Screenshot%202026-01-22%20173243.png" />

<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    @reviewer - **Won't do** - This would break existing compatibility with the legacy API. We'll address this in v2.0 when we can make breaking changes.
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Good example - Clear explanation why the suggestion wasn't implemented"
/>

<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    @reviewer - **Partially done** - Implemented the main optimization but left the logging as-is because it's needed for debugging in production.
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Good example - Explains what was done and what wasn't"
/>

<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    @reviewer - The performance impact is minimal because this code only runs during initial app startup, not on each request.
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Good example - Answers a question without resolving to continue conversation"
/>

## Why this matters

### For other reviewers

* **Clarity**: They can quickly see which suggestions were implemented and why others weren't
* **Efficiency**: No need to manually compare code to understand what changed
* **Learning**: Understanding why certain suggestions were rejected provides valuable context

### For the PR author

* **Documentation**: Creates a clear record of decisions made during the review
* **Accountability**: Shows you've carefully considered all feedback
* **Communication**: Demonstrates respect for the reviewer's time and input

## Handling different types of comments

### For **"Change"** comments

These are typically blocking requests that must be addressed. Always respond with:

* "**✅ Done**"
* "**Won't do** - reason why the change isn't being made"

### For **"Question"** comments

Reply without resolving so the author can read it and continue the conversation:

* "The reason for this approach is..."
* "Yes, that's handled in the validation layer"
* "Good point - let me clarify..."

Only mark questions as resolved after the conversation is complete and both parties agree.

## Responding to automated comments

When GitHub Copilot or other automated tools leave comments:

<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    @copilot - **Done** - Fixed the security vulnerability by adding input validation
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Good example - Responds to automated comments with same clarity"
/>

<boxEmbed
  style="greybox"
  body={<>
    @copilot - **False positive** - This code is safe because the input is already sanitized in the data access layer
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Good example - Corrects automated analysis with explanation"
/>

## Best practices

1. **Be specific**: Reference exactly what you did in response to the comment
2. **Include context**: Provide brief reasoning for your decisions
3. **Use consistent formatting**: Start with the status (Done, Won't do, etc.)
4. **Address all comments**: Don't leave any comment unresolved without a response
5. **Keep it concise**: Provide enough detail without being overly verbose

By following these practices, you create a more transparent and efficient code review process that benefits everyone involved.
The small extra effort of writing clear responses saves significant time and confusion for the entire team.
