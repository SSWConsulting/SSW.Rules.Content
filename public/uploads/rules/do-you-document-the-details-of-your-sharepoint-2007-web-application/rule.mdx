When you move to SharePoint 2010, you will need to know the settings you had on your 2007 server.
Therefore document all the settings from the SharePoint 2007 server, that you will need to re-create on the SharePoint 2010 server.

<endIntro />

Fill in the following table. You will use this later when creating the new web application in SharePoint 2010.

| **SharePoint 2010 Web Application Option** | **Where To Find This In SharePoint 2007** | **Answer** |

| Host Header | Application Management | Web application list |  **URL Field**  if a DNS name is used (not just the NetBIOS name).
                     If a DNS name is  **NOT**  used, leave this blank. |  |
| Authentication Provider | Application Management | Authentication Providers | (Click On the default zone if applicable) |  **IIS Authentication Settings**  field. |  |
