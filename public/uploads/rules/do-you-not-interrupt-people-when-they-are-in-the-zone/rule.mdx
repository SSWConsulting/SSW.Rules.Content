  they're in the zone, as interrupting can disrupt their creative momentum and take
  up to 15 minutes to recover.

If you interrupt someone when they are in the zone, it can take them 15 minutes to get back into the zone.

<endIntro />

Instead of interrupting someone directly, you can:

* Send them an email to contact you when free (preferred option)
* Ping them on Microsoft Teams or Skype with the message “See me when you are free”
