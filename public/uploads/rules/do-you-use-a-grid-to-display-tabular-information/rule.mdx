Use a standardized grid to display tabular information - you can sort, paginate, and filter data in your grid.
Here is a sample Kendo grid with filtering, pagination and sorting data: [sswtimepro.com/b/sample/kendo-grid](https://ssw.sswtimepro.com/b/sample/kendo-grid)

It demonstrate how to sort, filter and paginate data in the grid.

Also consider using the alternatives:

- [AG Grid](https://www.ag-grid.com)
- [PrimeNG](https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/)
- [Ng-zorro Table](https://ng.ant.design/components/table/en)
- [Material Table](https://material.angular.io/components/table/overview)
