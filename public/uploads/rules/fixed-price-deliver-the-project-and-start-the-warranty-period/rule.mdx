Once your internal testing is complete and you believe the fixed price component is ready to be tested in Staging, it's important to clearly communicate the beginning of the warranty period.

    ## Hi &#123;&#123; CLIENT NAME &#125;&#125;

As per our conversation, we confirm that we have now deployed the application, and so commences the 5-day warranty. The last day of the warranty will be &#123;&#123; DATE &#125;&#125;.

During this time, any defects or variations from the scope (as defined in the Specification Review document) will be fixed at no charge. See section 10 of [ssw.com.au/terms-and-conditions](https://www.ssw.com.au/terms-and-conditions) for more details.

If you find things that you’d like done that are not specified in the document, we’re happy to do those on a Time & Materials basis after the warranty period has ended.
