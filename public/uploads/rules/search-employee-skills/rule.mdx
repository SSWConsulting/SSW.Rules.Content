AD has all your users e.g. Bob, Mary, Jane...

SharePoint also has all your users, plus you can extend this information using the [UserProfile Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/manage-user-profiles?WT.mc_id=M365-MVP-33518).

The beauty of this is that if everyone has updated their skills, it is wonderfully searchable.

SharePoint has an Admin UI to manage User Profiles.

  } }

[Delve](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/what-is-delve-1315665a-c6af-4409-a28d-49f8916878ca) is a cool product with a nice UI that is essentially a portal onto the User Profiles.

Where it all falls down...

What if your people’s skills are stored in another system such as Dynamics 365 CRM or Salesforce?

  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "People’s skills are often stored in Dynamics 365 CRM or Salesforce",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }

You can use PowerShell and SharePoint PNP libraries to programmatically interact with the SharePoint UserProfile service. This process allows you to sync skills across systems with a custom solution:


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Powershell - Reading skills from UserProfile",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/search-employee-skills/extending-ad-5.png"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Powershell - Adding “Blazor” to Jean’s skill list",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/search-employee-skills/extending-ad-6.png"
/>

OpenSearch is another solution, using the OpenSearch protocol you can [add external data sources to your SharePoint search results](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/search/understanding-result-sources-for-search?WT.mc_id=M365-MVP-33518).

#### Suggestions to Microsoft

**#1 Help me better sync my Dynamics 365 CRM data with the SharePoint user profile service**

This should be a simple SharePoint connector so this piece of PowerShell glue is not required 👌\
E.g. CRM user skills to User Profile properties

**#2 Help me make Dynamics 365 CRM data searchable from SharePoint search**

If not using a connector, we should be able to easily index and search through Dynamics 365 CRM data.
This is essentially just calling a different API.

**#3 Help me customise SharePoint search results**

If you don’t want either of those options (i.e. you users’ skills are stored somewhere else), we should be able to change the search results UI.\
E.g. Search for people here: [https://ssw.com.au/people](https://ssw.com.au/people)

    shouldDisplay: true
  } }

**[\#4 Help me search for user entities in Dynamics 365 CRM](https://experience.dynamics.com/ideas/idea/?ideaid=b5daa141-90f5-eb11-ba5e-0003ff457d0a)**

There should be a global user search that goes across all entities in Dynamics 365 CRM.
