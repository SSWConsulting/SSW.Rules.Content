seoDescription: Automate your sign-in process and save time with a 'Stay signed in'
  checkbox.
title: Authentication - Do you have a 'Sign me in automatically' checkbox?
type: rule

When you present visitors to your site with an opportunity to sign in, you should always include an option to have that person signed in automatically.

This should be implemented simply by using a checkbox. A cookie should be stored on the user's computer so that next time they visit your site the sign in process is automatic.
