To help with automation (e.g. [SophieBot](https://sswsophie.com/sophiebot/)) you can use the MAC address of your mobile device to match when it joins the company Wi-Fi. This allows you to:

- Automatically log when you come in or out (See [Do you know the best way to see if someone is in the office?](/the-best-way-to-see-if-someone-is-in-the-office))
- Announce your presence to the rest of the office
- Get statistics and analytics: E.g. Who travels the most? Or which city uses In-And-Out the most?
