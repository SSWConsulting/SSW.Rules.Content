Microsoft Teams search is designed to help you quickly find the files you are collaborating on.

From the main search box, you can search for:

- Teams
- Channels
- Messages
- People
- Files

### Be aware of Teams Search limitations

  </>}
/>
If you start typing in the search box, you will see a dropdown with the main results that matches your query divided by type, prioritizing **Teams** and **Channels**:

  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'Search results for "marketing"',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/how-to-use-teams-search/teams-search-dropdown.png"
/>

<asideEmbed
  variant="info"
  body={<>
    **Tip:** Apart from the little heading, as per the image above, you can recognize a **Teams** result when it only shows up the title, while a **Channel** result shows the title with the name of the associated **Team** underneath.
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

Once you hit "enter", you will be directed to **all** results, separated by **Messages**, **People**, and **Files** tabs:


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'Use the 3 built-in tabs to search through the different types of results',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/how-to-use-teams-search/teams-search-tabs.png"
/>

<asideEmbed
  variant="info"
  body={<>
    **Tip:** After hiting "enter", to see the **Teams** and **Channels** results, simply click the search box again.
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

You may use built-in filters to refine your search under each of the tabs:


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'Built-in filters for Messages',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/how-to-use-teams-search/teams-search-filter.png"
/>

<asideEmbed
  variant="info"
  body={<>
    **Important:** Even though Teams search gives you quick access to all your messages and documents; the search is scoped to **Teams only**, which means you cannot search for files hosted on SharePoint, OneDrive, other Office365 products (E.g. Delve/UserProfile), or external sources (E.g. sugarlearning.com).

When you need to do a more extensive search, it is advised to use [SharePoint search](/sharepoint-search) instead.
