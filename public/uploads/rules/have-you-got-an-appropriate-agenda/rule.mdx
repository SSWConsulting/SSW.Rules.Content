Once you know which speakers you want and have established sponsorship and budget, you can start thinking about putting together an agenda.

It is another part of the event promotion and can have great influence on how your event is perceived and the type of audience you attract.

If you have multiple speakers for your event, it is a good idea to send a draft agenda to speakers and have them confirm their attendance and time. That way you can confidently publish the agenda with no further changes.
