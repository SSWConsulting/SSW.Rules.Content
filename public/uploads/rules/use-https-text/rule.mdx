Sometimes, you may come across text in a YouTube description that appears to be a link but lacks the familiar blue color plus underline and isn't clickable. This often happens because the text is missing the "https://" prefix.

Modern content editors and web browsers usually recognize this prefix as an indicator that the text should be converted into a clickable link. Without it, the text remains plain and doesn’t function as a hyperlink.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: "Bad example - The URL does not include \"https://\" prefix. The URL is not short and readable",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/use-https-text/url-https-image-1.png"

Read the rule [Do you make URLs short and readable?](/create-friendly-short-urls) for a better understanding of how to create good URL's.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good example - \"https://\" prefix included making it a link. The URL has been made short and readable",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }

/>


Making links clickable encourages more people to click on them.
