Before you do the task – say if the task requires a code change and you are using Azure DevOps, make sure it goes in as a work item.

After you do the task, the perfect workflow is to follow the rule to better project management with Azure DevOps - use TeamCompanion to send your ‘done’ and reply ‘done – changeset xxx’.
