Before you begin your journey into DevOps, you should assess yourself and see where your project is at and where you can improve.

This comprehensive DevOps evaluation covers these critical domains:

### 1. Team Onboarding & Collaboration

Efficient onboarding and seamless collaboration set the foundation for high-performing teams. Key aspects to track include onboarding time for new members, quality of documentation, communication tools in use, team size, meeting cadence, and the presence of cross-functional skills.

### 2. Deployments

Deployment practices are a strong indicator of delivery capability. Teams should monitor their most recent deployment date, deployment frequency, downtime during releases, incident resolution times, the number of environments, and overall deployment cycle time.

### 3. Coding Practices

High-quality code starts with disciplined development habits. This includes the use of source control, effective branching strategies, peer code reviews, well-defined pull-request workflows, and regular updates of dependencies.

### 4. Development Process

A clear and consistent process helps teams deliver predictably. Evaluate the development methodology in use—whether Agile, Scrum, Kanban, or hybrid—and how well the team identifies and manages technical debt.

### 5. Automation

Automation reduces manual effort and minimizes errors. Track automation in infrastructure provisioning, build pipelines, deployment workflows, and UI testing to ensure repeatable, scalable delivery.

### 6. Telemetry

Continuous monitoring is essential for proactive improvement. Measure how effectively your team tracks errors, monitors performance, and analyzes usage to inform both technical and business decisions.
