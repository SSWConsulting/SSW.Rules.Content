Reacting to GitHub Issues, PRs, and Discussions is a simple yet powerful way to show that you've seen and acknowledged a task, report or suggestion.

These reactions allow teams to give and get quick feedback, gauge consensus, and stay engaged without cluttering conversations or triggering extra notifications.

<endOfIntro />

For GitHUb Issues, [react with a 👍 (like) to show you have read and agree](react-to-reviewed-pbis). If you don’t agree with it, use a 👎 (dislike) with a quick comment to explain the reasons.

Feel free to use other reactions like 👀 or ❤️ to keep discussions more engaging, and reduce uncertainty about whether some feedback is being considered.

## Vote up on GitHub Discussions

With GitHub Discussions, voting up adds an extra layer of valuable feedback. Maintainers can see what the community prioritizes most, making it easier to focus on high-impact requests.
