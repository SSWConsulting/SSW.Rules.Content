<introEmbed

[Controlled Lookup Data](/do-you-deploy-controlled-lookup-data) is when data is tightly coupled to the application. If the data is not there, you have problems. So how do we check to see if data is still there?

Let's look at an example, of a combo that is populated with Controlled Lookup data (just 4 records)

### Modern Frameworks (EF)

With Frameworks like Entity Framework you can write unit tests to catch data issues before it becomes an problem.

### Legacy Applications

With legacy applications, creating a stored procedure will have the same effect with a bit more effort.

              WHERE RegionDescription = 'Eastern')
        PRINT 'Eastern is there'

        PRINT Western is there'

    IF EXISTS(SELECT TOP 1 * FROM dbo.[Region]
              WHERE RegionDescription = 'Northern')
        PRINT 'Northern is there'

        RAISERROR(N'Lack of Northern', 10, 1)
    IF EXISTS(SELECT TOP 1 * FROM dbo.[Region]
              WHERE RegionDescription = 'Southern')
        PRINT 'Southern is there'
    ELSE
        RAISERROR(N'Lack of Southern', 10, 1)
