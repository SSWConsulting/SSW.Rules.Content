The main 5 types used are:

1. All uppercase – ALL UPPERCASE
2. All lower case – all lowercase
3. Pascal case - PascalCase
4. Camel case – camelCase
5. Only first letter capitalized - Onlythefirstletter

Here’s a quick overview:

- **JavaScript** - Pascal case
- **jQuery** - Camel case
- **Angular** (previously AngularJS) - Only first letter capitalized
- **SharePoint** - Pascal case

- **SAP** - All uppercase
- **Salesforce** - Only first letter capitalized

  (Note: Scrum is not an acronym, so it should never be spelled "SCRUM") |
