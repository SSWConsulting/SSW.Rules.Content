Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for pattern matching and text processing, but they can be challenging to write and debug. Online regex tools like [RegExr](https://regexr.com/) and [Regex101](https://regex101.com/) simplify this process by providing interactive environments to test, debug, and learn regex. These tools save time, reduce errors, and help you master regex faster.

## Why use online regex tools?

* **Instant Feedback**: Test your regex patterns in real-time and see immediate results
* **Learning Resources**: Many tools include tutorials, examples, and explanations to help you understand regex syntax
* **Debugging Features**: Identify issues in your regex with visual aids and detailed error messages
* **Cross-Platform**: These tools are accessible from any browser, making them convenient for developers on the go

```python
import re

# Define the regex pattern for validating passwords
pattern = r"^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[!@#$%^&*()_+\-=\[\]{};':\"\\|,.<>\/?]).{8,}$"

# List of passwords to validate
passwordList = [
    "A1b2C3d4!",
    "S3cur3#Key",
    "Pass!",
    "Password1",
    "password!1",
    "A1b2C3d4!"
]

# Loop through the passwords and use re.search to validate them
for password in passwordList:
    if re.search(pattern, password):
        print(f"Valid: {password}")
    else:
        print(f"Invalid: {password}")
```

```code
Valid: A1b2C3d4!
Valid: S3cur3#Key
Invalid: Pass!
Invalid: Password1
Invalid: password!1
Valid: A1b2C3d4!
```
