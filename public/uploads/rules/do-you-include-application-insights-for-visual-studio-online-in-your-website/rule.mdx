Once deployed, Application Insights will start tracking metrics and interacting with your Visual Studio Online dashboards.

Application Insights tracks a lot of metrics in your website but one of the most useful is the breakdown of visits by each browser (IE, Chrome etc).

Sometimes you will be trying to add Application Insights to an existing project and the context menu item will not be there. There is a manual way to add Application Insights if this is the case.
