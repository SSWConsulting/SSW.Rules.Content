On intranets you always want a bunch of links easily accessible and customizable by the end users.

<endIntro />

In SharePoint your left navigation can be:

### The built-in site navigation

Good points:

* Built-in – the default navigation system in SharePoint

Bad points:

* Viewer – Not very pretty
* Viewer – Can only use emoji not icons in names
* Customizing – Cant be customized

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure="Bad example – Viewing"
  src="/uploads/rules/best-sharepoint-navigation/sharepoint-nav-bad1.png"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure="Bad Example - Editing (No customizations)"
  src="/uploads/rules/best-sharepoint-navigation/sharepoint-nav-bad2.png"
/>


### Web links – SharePoint web part

Good points:

* Pretty
* Easy to edit
  Bad points:
* Static (only exists on the page, won’t show on any other pages on the site)

Good example:


<boxEmbed
  style="todo"
  body={<>
    TODO: Insert Warwick’s video when made
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Good example – Customizing is easy"
/>

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Good example – Custom icons and built-in icons that look nice"
  src="/uploads/rules/best-sharepoint-navigation/sharepoint-nav-good.png"
/>
