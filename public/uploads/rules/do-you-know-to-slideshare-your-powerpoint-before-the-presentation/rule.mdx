Follow these steps to ensure you get as much coverage as possible before and after your presentation:

1. Prepare your PowerPoint as normal. Refer to [SSW Rules to Better Presentations](/rules-to-better-powerpoint-presentations)
2. Work on your presentation from SharePoint to allow sharing
3. Get your content [checked by a tester and a designer](/do-you-get-your-ppt-tester-to-do-a-test-please-preferably-a-designer))
4. Before you upload to SlideShare, add two slides: 1. On the last slide, add a generic SlideShare link such as slideshare.net/YourAccount - E.g. slideshare.net/SSWConsulting/ 2. On the first slide add a note that contains the version. This is so that you can compare easily what version is on SharePoint and what is on SlideShare

  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-to-slideshare-your-powerpoint-before-the-presentation/versionnumber.jpg"
/>


5. Upload to SlideShare – Make sure the title **doesn’t** have the version number on it
6. Go to “My uploads” and change the presentation title to have the version number

  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-to-slideshare-your-powerpoint-before-the-presentation/version-number-slideshare.jpg"
/>

7. Create a "\_OnSlideshare.txt" file with the Slideshare URL and add it to SharePoint on the same folder where the original PPT is
8. Now you can present!
