  system compared to labels, ensuring absolute certainty of changes and making it

Although labels are useful they can be changed after they have been created with no way to tell that they have been changed.

**Fact #1** : Creating a branch of 1GB of source code does not increase the size of your database by 1GB. It just adds a bunch of pointers. Only the differences are actually stored.
**Fact #2** : When you delete a branch it is not really “deleted”, you are just ending the history. You can undelete at a later time.

**Tip** : Find deleted items by ticking “Tools | Options | Source Control | Visual Studio Team Foundation Server | Show deleted items in the Source Control Explorer”
