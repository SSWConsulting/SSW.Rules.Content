  "Exit Sub" statements before "End Sub". This unnecessary code can hinder program
  functionality.
title: Do you know not to put Exit Sub before End Sub? (VB)
type: rule
uri: put-exit-sub-before-end-sub
---

Do not put "Exit Sub" statements before the "End Sub". The function will end on "End Sub". "Exit Sub" is serving no real purpose here.

<endOfIntro />

```vbnet
Private Sub SomeSubroutine()
'Your code here....
Exit Sub ' Bad code - Writing Exit Sub before End Sub.
End Sub
```
**❌ Bad example**  

```vbnet
Private Sub SomeOtherSubroutine()
'Your code here....
End Sub
```
**✅ Good example**  

We have a program called [SSW Code Auditor](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/Rules.aspx#ExitSub) to check for this rule.
