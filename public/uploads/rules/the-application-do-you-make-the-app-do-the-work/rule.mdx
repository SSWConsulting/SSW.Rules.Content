    Dear Mr Northwind,

Before installing your application, you need to
run this script by
first opening up SQL Management Studio.
Open the attached script, point it to Northwind and
execute the script.

Let me know if you have any issues...
We worked very hard on this release.

I hope you’re happy with it.

Regards,
Dave

    Dear Mr Northwind,

When you run the Northwind v1.0 (Rich Client) it will
automatically upgrade the database for you.

Just make sure you have dbo permissions ⚠️

Let me know if you run into any issues.

Regards,
Dave
