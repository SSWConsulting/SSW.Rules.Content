In the course of your employment, you may produce a number of videos for a project, a client, and/or for your profile.

<endIntro />

## Public company/product YouTube channel

Use the company/product/regional YouTube channel for best practices content.

Always upload to company main channel which has the most followers. 

E.g. [SSW TV channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBFgwtV9lIIhvoNh0xoQ7Pg)

For product-related content, collaborate with the product channel.

 E.g. [YakShaver](https://www.youtube.com/@SSWYakShaver), [TinaCMS](https://www.youtube.com/c/tinacms) or [SugarLearning](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBFgwtV9lIIhvoNh0xoQ7Pg)

For office-specific content (e.g. Office walkthroughs, Retreats), collaborate with the regional channel

E.g. [SSWEurope](https://www.youtube.com/@SSWEurope)

**Tip:** Create a playlist with your name in it, making it easier to find your videos over the years. These videos will help promote your profile, as well as the company's. 

E.g. [Adam Cogan  |  SSW](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpiOR7CBNvloVxgE0WiQioV6EuyfRtyUl\&si=KLu1CPtivxSEnrTW)

## Unlisted company/product YouTube channel

For [Done Videos](/record-a-quick-and-dirty-done-video) or content not intended for general audiences, upload them to the product or company YouTube channel as **unlisted**.

## Client YouTube channel

For important clients, upload the videos under an extra channel for that client project.

**Note: **Always to get approval from your client before uploading videos to Youtube. 

## Personal YouTube channel

In rare cases, for trivial content, you may [put them on **your own YouTube channel** under a dedicated playlist](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/57792) called "Work - COMPANY NAME". You can then look back to them a decade later and see how much you have improved fondly.
