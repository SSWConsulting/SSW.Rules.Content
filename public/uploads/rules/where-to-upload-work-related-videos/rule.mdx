In the course of your employment, you may produce a number of videos for a project, a client, and/or for your profile.

<endIntro />

## 🌍 Public company/product YouTube channel

Use the company/product/regional YouTube channel for best practices content.

* **All** - Always upload to company main channel which has the most followers. E.g. [SSW TV channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SSWTV)
* P**roduct-related content** - Collaborate with the product channel. E.g. [YakShaver](https://www.youtube.com/@SSWYakShaver), [TinaCMS](https://www.youtube.com/c/tinacms) or [SugarLearning](https://www.youtube.com/@sugarlearning)
* **Office-specific content** (e.g. office walkthroughs, retreats) - Collaborate with the regional channel. E.g. [SSWEurope](https://www.youtube.com/@SSWEurope)

    **Tip:** Create a playlist with your name in it, making it easier to find your videos over the years. These videos will help promote your profile, as well as the company's. E.g. [SSW TV | Adam Cogan SSW](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpiOR7CBNvloVxgE0WiQioV6EuyfRtyUl)

## 🔗 Unlisted company/product YouTube channel

For [Done Videos](/record-a-quick-and-dirty-done-video) or content not intended for general audiences, upload them to the product or company YouTube channel as **unlisted**.

## 🏢 Client YouTube channel

For important clients, upload the videos under an extra channel for that client project.

## 👤 Personal YouTube channel

In rare cases, for trivial content, you may put them on **your own YouTube channel** under a [dedicated playlist](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/57792) called "**Work - &#123;&#123; COMPANY NAME &#125;&#125;**". 

You can then look back to them a decade later and see how much you have improved fondly. E.g. [Adam Cogan | Work](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHfpOqYBdyCipla9YEHKcFyzarM9RbFLx).
