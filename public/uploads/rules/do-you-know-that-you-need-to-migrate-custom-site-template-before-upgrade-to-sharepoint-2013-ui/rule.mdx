If you have “custom site template” for your site, you can’t upgrade your site to the SharePoint 2013 UI unless you have a site template with the same name ready for new UI.

To fix this issue

1. Upgrade your site template’s **content** files and **definition** XML file to SharePoint 2013 (refer to SharePoint 2013 default site template for details).
2. Package the site template’s **content** files to map location “ **\{SharePointRoot}\Template\SiteTemplate** ”.
