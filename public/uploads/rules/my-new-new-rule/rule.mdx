AI coding tools like Claude Code offer several ways to extend their capabilities - skills, custom agents, subagents, MCP servers, and plugins. Each solves a different problem, and picking the wrong one leads to unnecessary complexity or limitations. Knowing which mechanism to reach for saves time and keeps your setup maintainable.

<endIntro />

## The quick decision guide

Before diving into the details, use this flowchart to find the right mechanism:

* **Need live data from an external system?** ➡ MCP Server
* **Need to teach the AI a workflow or procedure?** ➡ Skill
* **Need project-wide conventions always in context?** ➡ CLAUDE.md
* **Need parallel or isolated task execution?** ➡ Subagent
* **Need automatic reactions to lifecycle events?** ➡ Hook
* **Need to package and share extensions with your team?** ➡ Plugin
* **Need production automation or CI/CD integration?** ➡ Agent SDK

## What each mechanism does

| Mechanism | What it is | When to use it |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| **CLAUDE.md** | A markdown file loaded at the start of every session | Project conventions, coding standards, and context that should always be available |
| **Skill** | A folder with a SKILL.md file and optional supporting files (templates, scripts, examples) | Reusable workflows, domain expertise, slash commands like `/deploy` or `/review` |
| **Subagent** | An isolated AI instance with its own context window | Parallel research, heavy tasks you want out of your main context, enforcing tool restrictions |
| **Custom agent** | A reusable, task-specific agent definition with defined tools and instructions | Specialized roles like code reviewers or planners that get invoked across workflows |
| **MCP Server** | An external process that exposes tools and data via the Model Context Protocol | Connecting to databases, APIs, and SaaS platforms (GitHub, Jira, Slack, etc.) |
| **Plugin** | A distribution package that bundles skills, agents, MCP servers, and hooks together | Sharing a collection of extensions with your team or the community |

## Understanding the differences

### Skills vs MCP Servers

This is the most common source of confusion. The key distinction:

* **Skills teach the AI _what to do_** - they inject prompts, workflows, and domain knowledge
* **MCP Servers give the AI _access to data_** - they connect to external systems

They are complementary. A skill can instruct the AI to use tools exposed by an MCP server.

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    **Scenario:** You want the AI to create a GitHub issue with a specific format whenever it finds a bug.

    * **Skill** = defines the issue template, the labeling conventions, and the workflow steps
    * **MCP Server** = provides the connection to the GitHub API so the AI can actually create the issue
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Skills and MCP servers working together - the skill defines the workflow, the MCP server provides the integration"
  style="greybox"
/>

### Skills vs CLAUDE.md

Both provide instructions to the AI, but they load differently:

* **CLAUDE.md** is always loaded - every token counts against your context window from the start
* **Skills** load on demand - only the name and description are loaded at startup (~30-50 tokens each), with full instructions loading only when the skill is relevant

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    A CLAUDE.md file with 5,000 tokens of instructions for code reviews, deployment procedures, commit message formats, and PR templates - all loaded even when you're just asking a quick question.
  </>}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure="Putting everything in CLAUDE.md wastes context tokens on instructions that aren't needed for every task"
/>

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    A lean CLAUDE.md with project conventions (500 tokens), plus separate skills for `/review`, `/deploy`, `/commit`, and `/pr-template` that only load when invoked.
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="CLAUDE.md for always-on context, skills for task-specific workflows"
/>

### Subagents vs doing everything in the main conversation

Subagents run in their own context window. This means:

* Heavy search results don't clutter your main conversation
* Multiple subagents can work in parallel (up to 10 concurrently)
* You can restrict what tools a subagent has access to (e.g. read-only for reviewers)
* The main conversation only receives a summary of the work

Use subagents when the task is self-contained and doesn't need back-and-forth with the user.

### Plugins vs standalone configuration

Plugins are a **packaging format**, not a capability. A plugin bundles skills, agents, MCP servers, and hooks into a single installable package. If you're just customizing your own setup, configure each mechanism directly. Use plugins when you need to distribute a collection of extensions to others.

## The extensibility spectrum

These mechanisms form a spectrum from simple to complex. Start simple and only add complexity when needed:

1. **CLAUDE.md** - Static knowledge and conventions (start here)
2. **Skills** - Reusable, on-demand expertise with supporting files
3. **Hooks** - Event-driven automation (e.g. auto-format after edits, block destructive commands)
4. **MCP Servers** - External tool and data source integration
5. **Subagents** - Isolated, specialized execution contexts
6. **Plugins** - Shareable packages bundling all of the above
7. **Agent SDK** - Full programmatic agents for production systems

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    Think of it like a software project:

    * **CLAUDE.md** = your README and .env file - always-present configuration
    * **Skills** = your utility library - reusable, modular, loaded when needed
    * **Subagents** = your worker threads - isolated, parallel, focused execution
    * **MCP Servers** = your API integrations - connecting to external services
    * **Hooks** = your middleware - automatic processing at lifecycle boundaries
    * **Plugins** = your npm packages - distributable bundles for sharing
  </>}

## Practical adoption strategy

Don't try to adopt everything at once. Follow this progression:

1. **Start with CLAUDE.md** - Add your project conventions, build commands, and architecture overview
2. **Create skills for your top 3 repeated tasks** - Code reviews, commit messages, and planning are common first choices
3. **Add hooks for quality gates** - Auto-formatting, blocking destructive commands, requiring tests before stopping
4. **Configure MCP servers for external integrations** - Databases, GitHub, search APIs
5. **Build custom subagents for specialized roles** - Read-only reviewers, parallel researchers
6. **Package into plugins for team sharing** - When your setup is mature and others would benefit
