<introEmbed
  body={<>
In C#, backslashes in strings are special characters used to produce "escape sequences", for example \r\n creates a line break inside the string. This means that if you want to put a backslash in a string you must escape it out by inserting two backslashes for every one, e.g. to represent **C:\Temp\MyFile.txt** you would use **C:\\Temp\\MyFile.txt** . This makes the file paths hard to read, and you can't copy and paste them out of the application.

By inserting an @ character in front of the string, e.g. **@"C:\Temp\MyFile.txt"** , you can turn off escape sequences, making it behave like VB.NET. File paths should always be stored like this in strings.
