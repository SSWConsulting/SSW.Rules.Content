seoDescription: When you update a Product Backlog Item (PBI) to reflect a change verbally
  requested by the Product Owner, use the discussions feature and mention the user
  using "@username" instead of sending an email. This keeps track of the conversation
  and allows everyone involved to stay updated.
title: Do you use comments with @mentions to track changes in a PBI?

When the Product Owner makes a verbal change request or decision, you might consider sending an email and CCing others, but that limits visibility to only those on the thread.

A better approach is to **update the PBI** to document the change, making the conversation visible to the entire team. Use **comments** with **tags/mentions (@username)** to notify the Product Owner and any relevant team members. This ensures they receive email notifications about the update.

<endIntro />

## ✅ The benefits of using comments with @mentions on PBIs

* Quick and easy, no need to compose an email
* History is visible to anyone looking at the PBI (with email, if you don't CC them, they wouldn't have a clue)
* Easy to see all important information in one place, instead of digging through email

### How it works

Say the Product Owner asks you to prioritize and update PBI 1234.

### Format PBI comments like an email

Try formatting your mentions like an email to clarify both accountability and responsiblity and identify the current status of the project. This is especially useful when [requesting a "test please"](/request-a-test-please).

**Note:** You can and should use @mention on **pull requests** as well.
