External links should **open in a new tab** (by using HTML's **target="\_blank"**). Since browsers implemented tabs (replacing new window), it's considered a good practice to open external links in a different tab.

- Avoiding 'Back-Button Fatigue';
- Keeping 'User Flow';
- Keeping a good track of Analytics
