<endIntro />

* Read the [Wikipedia Unit test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) page and learn how to write unit tests on fragile code.
* Read Tim Ottinger & Jeff Langr's [**FIRST** principles of unit tests](http://agileinaflash.blogspot.com/2009/02/first.html) (**F**ast, **I**solated, **R**epeatable, **S**elf-validating, **T**imely) to learn about some common properties of good unit tests.
* Read Bas Dijkstra's [Why I think unit testing is the basis of any solid automation strategy](https://www.ontestautomation.com/why-i-think-unit-testing-is-the-basis-of-any-solid-automation-strategy/) article to understand how a good foundation of unit tests helps you with your automation strategy.
* Read Martin Fowler's [UnitTest](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UnitTest.html) to learn about some different opinions as to what constitutes a "unit".
* Read the short article [100 Percent Unit Test Coverage Is Not Enough](https://www.stickyminds.com/article/100-percent-unit-test-coverage-not-enough) by John Ruberto as a cautionary tale about focusing on test coverage over test quality.
* Read the [Wikipedia Test-driven development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) page (optional)
* Read the [SSW Rule - Test Please](/conduct-a-test-please-internally-and-then-with-the-client) - we never release un-tested code to a client!
