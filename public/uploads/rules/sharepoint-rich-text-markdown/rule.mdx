When creating a SharePoint Modern page, you can use many different webparts to enrich your content - Videos, Embedded PowerBI, and many more.

When you want to add plain text to a page, you have two choices: Text (or Rich Text) Webpart, or Markdown WebPart.

    preset: "default",
    figure: 'The two common types of Text WebParts - "Text" and "Markdown"',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}

Whenever possible, you should use the Text WebPart as it offers a much nicer editing experience, but more importantly provides a detailed Version History.


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'You can navigate to the page version history through "Page Details" | "Version History"',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/sharepoint-rich-text-markdown/version-history-nav.png"
/>

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: 'Good example - Turn on Highlight changes on this page so you can see the detailed changes in an easy-to-read format',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/sharepoint-rich-text-markdown/tick-the-highlight-switch.png"
/>

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: 'Bad Example - Markdown WebPart - No detailed history, all I can tell is that something changed on that component',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/sharepoint-rich-text-markdown/bad-example-md.png"
/>

<imageEmbed

  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: 'Good example â€“ Rich Text WebPart - I can very easily tell what\'s been added/removed from the content',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
