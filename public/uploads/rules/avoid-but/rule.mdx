The word "but" often sounds negative and creates friction—even when you're agreeing. Phrases like *"Yes, but...”* can come across as dismissive, subtly negating what was just said. This can make the other person feel unheard or contradicted.

Instead, try using *"Yes, and..."* to acknowledge the previous point and build upon it. This approach encourages collaboration and keeps conversations constructive.

In **written communication**, you can often replace "but" with a full stop and start a new sentence.

<asideEmbed

  body={<>
    “I agree with your idea, but it needs refinement.”
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: 'Bad example - Sounds dismissive, as the "but" undermines your agreement',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
/>

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    “I agree with your idea. It needs refinement.”
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: 'Good example - Keeps the tone neutral and supportive. Both thoughts stand on their own',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
/>

This small change keeps the tone neutral and professional while delivering the same message more effectively.

### 💼 Sales Tip

When a client questions the price, don’t say:

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    “Yes, but it’s expensive because we put a lot of effort into it.”
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: 'Bad example – Sounds apologetic and defensive.',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
/>

Instead, use confidence and the “yes, and” approach:

<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    “Yes, and that’s because we put a lot of effort into it.”
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: 'Good example – Acknowledges the concern and reinforces the value.',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
/>

Stand behind your value. The language you use shapes how your price is perceived.
