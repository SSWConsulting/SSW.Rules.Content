<introEmbed
  body={<>
The word "but" often sounds negative and creates friction—even when you're agreeing. Phrases like *"Yes, but...”* can come across as dismissive, subtly negating what was just said. This can make the other person feel unheard or contradicted.

Instead, try using *"Yes, and..."* to acknowledge the previous point and build upon it. This approach encourages collaboration and keeps conversations constructive.

    **Tip:** Remember to choose the **right words** and maintain a constructive **tone**.

In **written communication**, you can often replace "but" with a full stop and start a new sentence.

    “I agree with your idea, but it needs refinement.”
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: "Bad example - Sounds dismissive, as the \"but\" undermines your agreement",
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
/>



<asideEmbed

  body={<>
    “I agree with your idea. It needs refinement.”
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good example - Keeps the tone neutral and supportive. Both thoughts stand on their own",
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
/>


This small change keeps the tone neutral and professional while delivering the same message more effectively.

### 💼 Sales Tip

When a client questions the price, don’t say:


<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    “Yes, but it’s expensive because we put a lot of effort into it.”
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: "Bad example – Sounds apologetic and defensive.",
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
/>


Instead, use confidence and the “yes, and” approach:


<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    “Yes, and that’s because we put a lot of effort into it.”
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good example – Acknowledges the concern and reinforces the value.",
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
/>


Stand behind your value. The language you use shapes how your price is perceived.

## Handling Objections & Personal Attacks (AVR)

Sometimes the other person is flat-out wrong or takes a swipe at you.
Use **Acknowledge → Validate → Reframe (AVR)** to stay calm, correct the record, and move forward:

| Step | What to say | Why it works |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **1 Acknowledge** | “I hear this is frustrating.” | Naming feelings lowers defensiveness and arousal :contentReference[oaicite:2]\{index=2} |
| **2 Validate***(Feel–Felt–Found option)* | “Others **felt** the same at first…” | People feel heard when you show empathy :contentReference[oaicite:3]\{index=3} |
| **3 Reframe with ‘Yes, and’** | “Yes, **and** it sounds like the real issue is risk—let’s look at mitigations.” | Improv research shows “Yes, and” increases cooperation :contentReference[oaicite:4]\{index=4} |
| **4 Provide facts calmly** | “Our last three projects this size finished inside two weeks.” | Non-violent communication focuses on needs, not blame :contentReference[oaicite:5]\{index=5} |
| **5 Bridge & pivot** | “What might help is a weekly checkpoint—does that work for you?” | Bridging keeps the deal moving instead of bogging down in debate :contentReference[oaicite:6]\{index=6} |

### Quick scripts

**Price objection (sales call)**
*Prospect*: “That’s double our budget!”
*You*: “I get why that feels steep, and others felt the same. They found bundling discovery and the build cut re-work. Shall we unpack the value together?”

**Personal dig (internal)**
*Colleague*: “You always set impossible deadlines.”
*You*: “Sounds like the timing hasn’t worked for you, and I’d like to fix that. Let’s map the timeline and see where it slipped.”

### Why this works

* Validation makes people feel heard, reducing stress hormones :contentReference[oaicite:7]\{index=7}.
* Reframing steers the chat from blame to problem-solving :contentReference[oaicite:8]\{index=8}.
* Bridging and pivoting are proven objection-handling moves in sales playbooks :contentReference[oaicite:9]\{index=9}.

## Cheat-sheet

* Swap **“but”** for **“and”** or a new sentence.
* AVR for heat: **Acknowledge → Validate → Reframe**.
* Use **Feel-Felt-Found** if you need a quick empathy shortcut.
* End with a forward-looking question: “How does that sound?”
