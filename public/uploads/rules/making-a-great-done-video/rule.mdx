Although it can be daunting, creating a awesome 'Done Video' doesn't have to be hard. Luckily, we have you covered with these key tips to make your 'Done Video' great!

<endOfIntro />

## Content

1. **Generic** - Keep your video appealing and easy to understand for a global audience. The video should not directly discuss the specific tasks of a PBI, but rather address the new feature or change as a whole.
2. **Prepare** - Plan what you're going to say and open the browser tabs you'll show beforehand. This means you should practice what you're going to say, especially your Intro and Outro!
3. **Introduction** - Start by introducing yourself and what you will be talking about. E.g. *"Hi everyone, my name is Bob Northwind and today I would like to show you..."*
4. **Show the Pain** - Demonstrate the problem that your new feature will fix, then demonstrate your feature.
5. **Ending** - Finish with a strong closing that summarizes what you talked about and conclude with a compelling call-to-action (CTA). See the rule about [SSW.Rules | Production - Do you have a call to action (aka CTA)?](/production-do-you-add-a-call-to-action/)
6. **Quick** - Keep it short, concise, and don't repeat yourself! Ideally we want to keep the video under 5 minutes.
7. **Directing Attention** - Give people an idea of where to look by mentioning positions on the screen before taking actions. E.g. *"At the bottom of the screen" or "in the top right-hand corner."*
8. **Presentation** -  Present data from X to Y. E.g. for financial data start with the last month and then show the current month.

## Presentation

1. **Apparel** - If your company has branded clothing, make sure it's ironed, tidy and visible. Wear it proudly! Alternatively, wear clean, neutral color clothing. E.g. White, grey, or black shirt
2. **Framing** - Have your webcam height at eye level for engagement. Make sure there is sufficient headroom: not too little (don't cut off the top of your head in the frame) and no too much (the subject needs to fill the frame). Ensure your branded clothing is visible and the background is clean and tidy, also consider tilting the camera for a more dynamic background with depth instead of a flat background.

/>


3. **Lighting** - Ensure there is optimal room lighting and facial brightness. Consider a ceiling-pointing lamp for additional light. Avoid intense backlights to prevent silhouetting.
4. **One-Take** - Record it in one take, but start again if it's super bad. If something out-of-your control happens, try to be natural! If you mistype a word or click the wrong button, don't freak out and start again, incorporate it. E.g. *"Whoops, clicked build accidently. Let me just refresh and go again."*
   * **Note:** If your video is short (1-2 mins), then starting again may be optimal. However, if your video is long. E.g. 15-20 minutes, then try to incorporate any accidental errors and keep going.

5. **Clean UI** - When using a browser, IDE, or any relevant application, ensure a clean interface:
   * For your browser, hide the bookmarks bar and set the zoom to 125%. (You can easily get a clean browser by using a guest or incognito profile)
   * If presenting in Microsoft Office, hide the ribbon.
   * When using Outlook for presentations, clear any irrelevant reminders.

6. **Resolution** - Set your screen to 1080p (1920x1080).
7. **Recording** - Record both your screen and webcam.
8. **Audio** - Check your audio devices for the best quality and make sure your audio is clear and not distracting. E.g. Position the microphone close to your mouth.
9. **Be Friendly** - Interact with your webcam like it's a person, and smile at the Intro and Outro.
10. **No Edits** - Don't edit the video; use a picture-in-picture format and hotkeys to switch visuals.
11. **Do a Test Recording** - After all this effort to capture a great video this can catch any last-minute changes and cut down on potential re-recordings. E.g. Test your Intro hook and screen transitions.

Remember to watch some "Done" videos to get an idea of what a good "Done Video" looks like!
