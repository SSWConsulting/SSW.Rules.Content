Some clients really want a discount. Most will be happy with a discount for pre-paying. Others won't go ahead until they feel they have got something more.

If a client asks for a further discount, try to add value by offering something else.

Examples:

- One of your products at no charge
- A Senior Consultant for 2 hours to complete the following tasks:
  - Code Review
  - UI Review

Also bear in mind that offers like 2 for 1 are better than 50% discount because:

- You sell for the price you wanted instead of losing money - adding an extra person or a licence is inexpensive
- You are adding value to what you are selling e.g. more people will turn up to the event
