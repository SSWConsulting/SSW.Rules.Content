  body={<>
Phishing is a form of social engineering where an attacker tries to convince a victim that a resource they are in control of is a legitimate resource. This is usually achieved through the use of deceptive email messages or websites.

Attackers will often craft a website that looks like a legitimate one for the sole purpose of stealing your username and password (or some other sensitive information). They might, for example, build a website that looks exactly like LinkedIn, so that you think you are logging into LinkedIn, but are in fact giving an attacker your username and password.

A URL is made up of a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) and a path. The FQDN is the part between the **https://** and the next **/**. Anything after the **/** is part of the path and not the FQDN.

The FQDN is made up of a top-level domain (TLD), a domain, and then a subdomain or subdomains. These move from right to left, so for the address [https://www.ssw.com.au/](https://www.ssw.com.au/), **.com.au** is the TLD, **ssw** is the domain, and **www** is a subdomain.

For the address [https://www.ssw.com.au/people/](https://www.ssw.com.au/people/), **people** is the path. The path can include all kinds of other characters and parameters.

You should always check that the **domain** matches the service or website you are expecting.

If you are curious about a URL, and think it might be legitimate, you can [check the Whois record](https://whois.domaintools.com) to see who owns the domain.
