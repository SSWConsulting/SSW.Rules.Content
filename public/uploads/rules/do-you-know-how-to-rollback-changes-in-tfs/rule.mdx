There are two ways to do this:

**A.** If you haven’t checked in any files since you started modifying them then the process is simple:

* Right click your solution and **Undo Pending Changes**

  ![](/uploads/rules/do-you-know-how-to-rollback-changes-in-tfs/rollback1.gif)

**B.** If you aren’t so lucky and have made some commits along the way then the only option is to use the Rollback command:

To use this you will need to install Team Foundation Server Power Tools v1.2

* Find the revision before you started checking code in using the **History command**

  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'The last revision before Tristan made changes was 5367',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
  src="/uploads/rules/do-you-know-how-to-rollback-changes-in-tfs/rollback2.gif"
/>

* Open the Command Prompt in your current working directory and type **“c:\Program Files\Microsoft Team Foundation Server Power Tools\tfpt.exe” rollback /changeset:5367**

  ![](/uploads/rules/do-you-know-how-to-rollback-changes-in-tfs/rollback3.gif)

* Click  **Yes** and the rollback will proceed

It would be nice if there was a GUI for this tool so that I can just right click and select rollback.
