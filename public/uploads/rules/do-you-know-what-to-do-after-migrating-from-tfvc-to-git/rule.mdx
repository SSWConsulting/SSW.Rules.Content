After you [use the right tool to migrate from TFVC to Git](/do-you-know-the-best-tool-to-migration-from-tfvc-to-git), there's a few more things you need to do to clean things up for a new user joining the project. By default, if there is a TFVC repository, that will become the default in the UI.

Unfortunately, you can't kill the TFVC repository and make Git the default one, so there's a few steps you need to follow.

**❌ Figure: Bad Example - Can't delete the now deprecated TFVC repository**  

### Delete files from TFVC

Go into the repository, delete any existing files. Add a new document saying "\_Migrated_to_Git.md". This will stop people from getting the wrong code.

**Note** : All the source code is still there, it's just flagged as being deleted.

### Lock down TFVC

In the TFVC repository, click Security

**Figure: Configure the security of the TFVC repository

Then deny check-ins to **Contributors** , P **roject Administrators** and **Project Collection Administrators** . This should stop anyone from committing new code to the repository.

### Update the Dashboard

Next step is to update the dashboard to let new developers know.

**✅ Figure: Good example - Let new users know that the source control is now on Git**  

### Suggestions for the VSTS team

1. Give us the ability to hide a repository
2. Give us the ability to set a repository as the default for all users
3. Give us the ability to delete a TFVC repository

Having any of these suggestions will avoid the confusion on this screen
