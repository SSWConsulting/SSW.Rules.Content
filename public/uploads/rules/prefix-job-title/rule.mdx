Consistency is the most important part of branding. It leads to familiarity which builds brand recognition. 

A simple and effective method is prefixing job titles everywhere they appear with the company name.

<endIntro />

<boxEmbed
  style="info"
  body={<>
    **Note:** This applies to all platforms, including **LinkedIn**, **GitHub**, **X (Twitter)**, and others.
  </>}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure=""
/>

A job title on social media or other public place should **always** be:

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    **{{ COMPANY NAME }} {{ POSITION }}**
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="The right structure for your title. E.g. &#x22;SSW Software Engineer&#x22;"
  style="greybox"
/>

<boxEmbed
  style="tips"
  body={<>
    **Tip:** On LinkedIn you might put your title in 2 places:
    
    * Bio
    * Job experience
    
    In both places, you should use the correct format.
  </>}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure=""
/>

This is to maintain consistency across the company - the companies with strong branding have [consistency](https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34231/8-businesses-that-nail-social-media-brand-consistency.aspx)!
