Consistency is the most important part of branding. It leads to familiarity which builds brand recognition. A simple and effective method is prefixing job titles everywhere they appear with the company name.

  body={<>
    **Note:** This applies to all platforms, including **LinkedIn**, **GitHub**, **X (Twitter)**, and others..
  </>}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure=""
/>


A job title on social media or other public place should **always** be:

* **&#123;&#123; COMPANY NAME &#125;&#125; &#123;&#123; POSITION &#125;&#125;**
  E.g. "SSW Software Engineer"

  style="info"
  body={<>
    On LinkedIn you might put your title in 2 places (bio and job experience) **In both places, you should use the correct format!**
  </>}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure=""
/>


This is to maintain consistency across the company - the companies with strong branding have [consistency](https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34231/8-businesses-that-nail-social-media-brand-consistency.aspx)!
