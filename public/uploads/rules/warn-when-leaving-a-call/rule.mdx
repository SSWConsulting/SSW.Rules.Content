Group calls are made for important discussions to be had, and distractions can derail them. Ever been in a group call where someone just vanishes? It's confusing and can mess up the flow of conversation.

<endOfIntro />

## Taking a short break

If you have to take a break, **avoid interruptinons** and **keep things moving** by simply messaging 'BRB' and 'I'm Back' in the chat.

    Interrupting the flow of conversation to verbally tell everyone you have to leave.

    figure: "OK example - It's good to communicate, but still stops the chat for a bit",
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
/>

  body={<>
    Messaging in the group chat _"brb in X mins"_ ...
and then _"I’m back"_ when you return.
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good example - The call can continue smoothly and the team will know when you're back",
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
/>


## Leaving the call

If you need to leave the conversation, simply message that you have to go with the reason and without interrupting. Aim to give a few minutes notice.


<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    Messaging in the group chat _"Sorry, I have to go guys - Dinner time"_ and leave straight away
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "okExample",
    figure: "OK example - The call can continue smoothly and no one will be guessing where you went",
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
/>



<asideEmbed
  variant="greybox"
  body={<>
    Messaging in the group chat _"Dinner time - Will have to go in 5 minutes"_
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good example - The call can continue smoothly and people still have a chance to talk to you if they need",
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}
/>


This way the conversation doesn't need to pause if you are taking a break; and no one has to stop and wonder where you went.
