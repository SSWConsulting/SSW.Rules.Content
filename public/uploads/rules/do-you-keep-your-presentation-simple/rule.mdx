Making your presentation over-complicated is a very easy trap to fall into. Many speakers make the mistake of giving away too much information.

**KISS** - In its polite form, this stands for **K** eep **I** t **S** hort and **S** imple.

- In 20 minutes, you only have time for two major points
- In 30 minutes you might make three major points
- In 40-45 minutes you might be able to cover four major points, but three points and a longer time for questions would be a better alternative

Most experienced and talented TV presenters stick to making three points in half an hour - this is surely a lesson for anyone planning a presentation.
