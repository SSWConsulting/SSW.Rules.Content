Documenting your WebAPI is important but you don't want to spend a massive amount of time trying to keep documentation up to date. The solution is to use [Scalar](https://scalar.com/) or [Swagger](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md) ([Swashbuckle](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle)).
