seoDescription: Writing dates like 2/1/12 can cause misinterpretation or even fraud.
  Avoid short or ambiguous formats. Instead, use clear standards like ISO 8601 (2025-02-12)
  or 3-letter month formats (12 Feb 2025) to protect integrity and ensure global readability.

  body={<>
If you sign a document and write a date like `2/1/12`, you’ve left the door open for trouble. That shorthand can be **misread** (is it January 2nd or February 1st?) or even **tampered with** (someone could easily change it to `12/11/2012`), and you’d never know.

It's a small habit, but writing dates properly can prevent fraud, confusion, and embarrassment.

## ❌ Avoid short formats

* `2/1` is not helpful at all
* `2/1/12` is vulnerable to tampering and misreading

## ❌ Avoid ambiguous formats

* `08/09/25` could mean August 9, 2025 or September 8, 2025, depending on the region date format being used:

  * U.S. uses `MM/DD/YY`
  * Most of the world use `DD/MM/YY`

## ✅ Best options for clarity in documents

* **Formal / technical docs** - `2025-02-12` ([ISO 8601 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601))
* **Readable docs / mixed audiences** - `12 Feb 2025` (use a 3-letter month to avoid confusion)

### Format for clarity and integrity

* **Day** - Always two digits (`01` to `31`)
* **Month** - Use two digits (`01` to `12`) when you can't use letters
* **Year** - Always four digits (e.g. `2025` – unless you're from the future after year 9999)
* **Separators** - ISO 8601 prefers dashes (spaces if using 3-letter month)

> A document is only as reliable as the details on it. Don't let a shortcut make it questionable.

This rule isn't about style but about **trust**. Whether it's a legal contract, client invoice, or project brief, using full numeric dates to ensure:

* The date can't be easily altered
* Readers across regions (US, AU, EU) understand it clearly
* The document remains valid long into the future
