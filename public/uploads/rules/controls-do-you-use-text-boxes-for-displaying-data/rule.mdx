seoDescription: Use Textbox controls to display data and provide an intuitive user
  experience by making information easily copyable and selectable.
title: Controls - Do you use Text Boxes for displaying data?

Use Label controls to display static text of the application. Eg. "Customer ID:"
Use Text Box controls to display data (results of calculations, information, records from a database, etc.).

<endIntro />

The reasons are:

* users know it is data, not a label of the application
* users can copy and paste from the field

PS: One reason web UI's are nice, is that the information is always selectable/copyable.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure="Bad Example - Not only is the data cut off when you are using label, but you can't copy and paste the value"
  src="/uploads/rules/controls-do-you-use-text-boxes-for-displaying-data/BetterInterface_LabelCutOff.jpg"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Good Example - Using Textbox controls makes the data obvious to users"
  src="/uploads/rules/controls-do-you-use-text-boxes-for-displaying-data/GoodTextbox.gif"
/>


As you can see you'll barely know the difference, so start using Textboxes for displaying data, that's good practice.

#### More Information

When using TextBox controls in Windows Forms, set them up like this:


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure="Having the 'BorderStyle' Property set to Fixed3D is the best choice visually"
  src="/uploads/rules/controls-do-you-use-text-boxes-for-displaying-data/BorderStyle_1.gif"
/>



<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="none"
  figure="Make the text box Read-Only (users copying data is OK, changing is silly)"
  src="/uploads/rules/controls-do-you-use-text-boxes-for-displaying-data/ReadOnly_1.gif"
/>
