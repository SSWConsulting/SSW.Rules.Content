  Rule Summary page editing to synchronize with Site Title and Item Title.

When you want to update the Rule Title, please DO NOT update them in the list directly.
Click the URL near it, navigate to the Rule Summary page, and edit the Rule Summary Page Title, it will automatically update:

* Rule Summary Page Title
* Site Title
* Item Title in RuleCategoryLookupData List
