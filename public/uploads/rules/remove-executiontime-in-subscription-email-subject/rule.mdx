seoDescription: Remove @ExecutionTime from subscription email subjects to improve
  sorting and conversation threading in Outlook.
title: Admin - Do you remove @ExecutionTime in subject of subscription email?
type: rule
uri: remove-executiontime-in-subscription-email-subject
---

In subscription settings, @ExecutionTime should be removed from subject, because it ruins conversation threading in Outlook - You cannot sort them by subject.

So we always make subject of subscription exactly same as report name.
