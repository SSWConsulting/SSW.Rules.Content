  the format `<CompanyName>.<ComponentName>`, ensuring developers can quickly identify
  who developed the assembly and its purpose.

Assembly names should reflect the the functionality that it provides. For example,

<endIntro />

```cs
System.IO
```

contains all the classes that deal with inputs and outputs. As a general rule of thumb your assemblies should be named as follows:

&lt;CompanyName&gt;.&lt;ComponentName&gt; (e.g. SSW.Framework)

This allows a developer to know who developed the assembly and give the developer a general idea of what the assembly can be used for.
