seoDescription: Optimize your web pages with text instead of images for faster load
  times, better search engine visibility, and improved mobile readability
title: Do you use text rather than images where appropriate?
type: rule
uri: do-you-use-text-rather-than-images-where-appropriate
---

Using text rather than images has multiple advantages:

* Downloads faster - a users patience extends to about 7 seconds.
* Cheaper to update - a simple find and replace.
* Discoverable by search engines - if people can't get to your site, what's the point of it being there?
* Readable on an iPhone - Images will either be resized or require scrolling, which would create difficulties for readability.

```html
<img src="Images/Heading_Welcome.gif>
```
**❌ Bad Example - Using image for text header**  

```hcl
<h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>
```
**✅ Good Example - This text can be easily rendered by the browser and recognized by search engine**
