Using text rather than images has multiple advantages:

* Downloads faster - a users patience extends to about 7 seconds.
* Cheaper to update - a simple find and replace.
* Discoverable by search engines - if people can't get to your site, what's the point of it being there?
* Readable on an iPhone - Images will either be resized or require scrolling, which would create difficulties for readability.
