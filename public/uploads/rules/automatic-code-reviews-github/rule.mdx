Developers love submitting Pull Requests (PRs) but far fewer enjoy reviewing them. In particular, when Sprint Review approaches, developers get tunnel vision and only focus on tasks they've been assigned. By leveraging AI agents, you can catch many problems and gotchas in your PRs early, buying your senior devs more time (and sanity!) to review higher quality code.

In a perfect world,  reviewing a PR would simply be rubber-stamping perfect code. In reality, reviewers spend a lot of time flagging comments, typos, linting problems and, eventually bugs. This takes time away from focusing on more valuable concerns like scalability, maintainability, extensibility, and, ultimately the longevity of the code.

Enter AI agents. AI Agents such as [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) are great at improving code quality before putting the PR in front of a senior. By making your code more enjoyable to review, you'll find people won't disappear under a rock whenever you ping them with a PR.

There's a few agents developers can choose for their PR reviewing needs.

## GitHub Copilot Code Reviews ⭐ (recommended)

GitHub Copilot Pro users may request code reviews from GitHub Copilot manually, or configure automatic code reviews by GitHub Copilot whenever they make a Pull Request. Copilot will also suppress any reviews it generated with low confidence intervals, filtering out any code suggestions that are likely incorrect.

    **Tip:** If you still have your student status, you can get [GitHub Copilot Pro for free](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/manage-your-account/getting-free-access-to-copilot-pro-as-a-student-teacher-or-maintainer#about-free-github-copilot-pro-access).

  } }

In addition to leaving comments on PRs, GitHub Copilot can analyse the changes made by the developer and generate a useful description.

  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "PR description suggested by GitHub copilot",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/automatic-code-reviews-github/github-suggested-pr-description.png"
/>

GitHub Copilot can also be given specific instructions to follow when reviewing PRs. To set this up you can place custom instructions inside of a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file.

```markdown
// .github/copilot-instructions.md

When performing a code review, please finalize your review by saying "But what do I know, I'm just Cleverbot 2.0"
```

### Cursor's BugBot

Cursor's BugBot allows you to configure automatic code reviews for a specific repo within Cursor. If you're happy with the suggestions that Cursor has made you can click the **"Fix in Cursor"** button at the bottom of its comments to apply the fix in your Cursor IDE. In most cases BugBot requires a paid subscription. For more information, refer to [Cursor's documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/bugbot).

### CodeRabbit

[CodeRabbit](https://www.coderabbit.ai) works with VS Code as well as all of its forks (including Cursor) using an IDE Extension. Using the extension, developers can request code reviews before creating a PR. Similar to Cursor and GitHub Copilot, CodeRabbit can review PRs on GitHub. It comes with a generous 14 day trial.
