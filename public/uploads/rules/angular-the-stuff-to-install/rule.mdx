<introEmbed
  body={<>
If you want to get started with Angular, go to the [Angular Setup guide](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local).

The prerequisites are:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and  [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) (installed with Node.Js by default)
2. [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli)

The best practice for creating an Angular project and components is to use the [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) (command-line interface).

The Angular CLI is also used in the latest .NET Angular SPA template.
Read [Do you know that the ASP.NET Core SPA Template for Angular uses the Angular CLI?](/asp-net-core-spa-template-for-angular-uses-the-angular-cli)
  </>}
/>
Instructions for upgrading the Angular CLI of an existing project can be found on [update.angular.io](https://update.angular.io/).

### Getting errors?

If you get errors, follow instructions in the links:

* [Node gyp errors](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp)

* [Permission errors](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions)

### Which IDE should I use for developing Angular applications?

We recommend [VSCode](http://code.visualstudio.com). Read more on [Do you know the best IDE for Angular?](/how-to-get-your-machine-setup)

### Other tools to consider

In addition to the essential tools mentioned, there are several other useful browser extensions that can improve your development experience:

1. [Angular DevTools](https://angular.io/guide/devtools) for Angular 12+ applications.

Angular DevTools helps to debug and profile Angular applications by visualizing the component structure, inspecting component properties, inputs, and outputs and running a performance profiler.

2. [Redux DevTools](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools) when using state management libraries like NgRx or NgXs.

Redux DevTools allows for inspection, monitoring, and manipulation of the state of an Angular application.
