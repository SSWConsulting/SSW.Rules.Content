Automated and template-based emails are essential tools for businesses, but they often fall short in making data fields easily noticeable. Ensuring that important information stands out not only enhances readability but also improves user experience and efficiency.

Here are some practical tips for making data fields more obvious in your email communications:

* Use bold text to highlight key information
* Present items in lists for easy reading
* Place questions/tasks at the beginning to ensure immediate attention and action
