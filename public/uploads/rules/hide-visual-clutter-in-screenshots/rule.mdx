Screenshots are a very important part of websites these days. Ensure they are clean and free of distractions like browser tabs, toolbars, debug windows, and taskbars.

Tips:

* Use a region screen shot if appropriate (however the URL is generally helpful in most browser screenshots)
* Go full screen
* Always have the 'Auto-hide the taskbar' option checked
