Screenshots are a very important part of websites these days. Ensure they are clean and free of distractions like browser tabs, toolbars, debug windows, and taskbars.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  captionStyle="badExample"
  captionText={"Bad example - Screenshot includes personal tabs, toolbar, debug window, and taskbar"}
  src="/uploads/rules/hide-visual-clutter-in-screenshots/bad-screenshot-with-personal-data.png"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  captionStyle="goodExample"
  captionText={"Good example - Screenshot has been cropped to hide junks"}
  src="/uploads/rules/hide-visual-clutter-in-screenshots/good-no-personal-info.png"
/>


Tips:

* Use a region screen shot if appropriate (however the URL is generally helpful in most browser screenshots)
* Go full screen
* Always have the 'Auto-hide the taskbar' option checked

    Done Videos are an exception – it’s fine to include the full screen. See [Do you know how to record a quick and dirty 'Done Video'?](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/done-video/)
