So you should always put JavaScript in a separate file. Then the line numbers will stay consistent during debugging.
Keeping JavaScript in a separate file is also good for production as it improves performance due to browser caching.

**Note:** During development, remember to hit CTRL-F5 to force the browser to re-fetch the files from the server or you may be debugging old version of the JavaScript file.
