Sending a tender with inconsistent pricing, US spelling, or leftover placeholders undermines confidence fast. Even when the solution is strong, small errors signal a lack of care. A final QA pass ensures the document reflects the quality and attention to detail clients expect from SSW.

### Run a final QA pass before sending

Before any tender goes out, complete a deliberate, end-to-end quality check. This is not a skim—it's a structured verification against the points below.

### Numbers & money (zero tolerance for errors)

Pricing and quantities are the first things clients scrutinise.

* Use numerals, not number words (e.g. 10, not ten)
* Money must be dollars only \`$\` on the left
* No cents or decimals (e.g. \`$5,000\`, not \`$5,000.00\`)
* Ensure formatting is consistent
* Thousands separators used consistently
* Totals align correctly if shown
* Cross-check totals against line items

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    The project will run for ten weeks at a cost of $5000.00.
    
    Total estimated cost: $5,000
  </>}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure="Bad Example - Uses number words, includes cents, and formatting is inconsistent"
  style="greybox"
/>

<boxEmbed
  body={<>
    The project will run for 10 weeks at a cost of $5,000.
    
    Total estimated cost: $5,000
  </>}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Figure: Good Example - Numerals and money formatting are clear and consistent"
/>

#### Australian English only

* SSW tenders must read as locally written and reviewed.
* Enforce Australian spelling (e.g. organisation, optimise, colour)
* Remove US spellings and phrasing
* Fix spelling and grammar issues throughout

### Template compliance (SSW Word template)

Consistency in formatting signals professionalism and makes documents easier to review.

Use template styles only:

* Heading 1 / Heading 2 / Heading 3
* Normal
* Caption

No manual formatting (no bold-as-headings, no custom fonts)

Body text is 12pt or larger

Footer requirements:

* Page numbers right-aligned
* Includes ssw\.com.au
* Consistent across all sections

### Client specificity (no generic leftovers)

A tender must feel written for this client.

Client name is clear:

* Cover page
* Introduction
* Relevant sections throughout

Remove all placeholders:

* “TBD”
* "Client”
* “Lorem ipsum”

Validate references to:

* Client systems
* Industry context
* Project goals

### Readability and structure

Dense text hides good ideas.

Flag walls of text:

* Overlong paragraphs
* Sections that run for multiple pages

Improve readability by:

* Breaking content into headings and subheadings
* Using bullet points or tables where appropriate

Suggesting images or diagrams for:

* Architecture
* Process flows
* Timelines

### Communication quality (SSW standard)

How we communicate is part of the value we sell.

* Use audience-appropriate language
* Define acronyms and jargon on first use
* Start each major section with a plain-English summary, then provide detail

Keep tone:

* Constructive
* Precise
* Confident but not verbose

Remember: Consistency and attention to detail are quality requirements, not polish.

If it’s wrong or unclear in the tender, clients will assume it will be wrong or unclear in delivery too.
