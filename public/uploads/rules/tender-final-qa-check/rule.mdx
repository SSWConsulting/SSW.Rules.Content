Sending a tender with inconsistent pricing, US spelling, or leftover placeholders undermines confidence fast. Even when the solution is strong, small errors signal a lack of care. A final QA pass ensures the document reflects the quality and attention to detail clients expect from SSW.

### Run a final QA pass before sending

Before any tender goes out, complete a deliberate, end-to-end quality check. This is not a skim—it's a structured verification against the points below.

### Numbers & money (zero tolerance for errors)

Pricing and quantities are the first things clients scrutinise.

* Use numerals, not number words (e.g. 10, not ten)
* Money must be dollars only \`$\` on the left
* No cents or decimals (e.g. \`$5,000\`, not \`$5,000.00\`)
* Ensure formatting is consistent
* Thousands separators used consistently
* Totals align correctly if shown
* Cross-check totals against line items
