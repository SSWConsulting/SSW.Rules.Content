It is a good idea to create a dummy company to represent all clients on internal/external documentation, including a made-up name for the person behind that company.

For example, anytime you need to show a scenario of dealing with clients, use the made-up company called "Northwind" which is managed by the also made-up client "Mr. Bob Northwind", often referred to as just "Bob".

Most of documentation starts from a real-world situation, but you don't want to expose real clients' names.
