<introEmbed
  body={<>
When a prospective client gets a quote for a huge price it's like giving them a slap in the face. Break your proposals into a series of releases, where each is 1 or more Sprints, and clients can choose to proceed with a smaller financial commitment (such as just getting the mock-ups done) than if they were committing to the whole project. Often, small financial commitments will lead to bigger ones.

This approach also allows you to side-step common delaying tactics of prospective clients by making it easier to get the project moving. Break down the price:

1. A [Spec Review](/conduct-a-spec-review) price
2. Then a give a MVP (minimum viable product) price
3. Finally a total price
