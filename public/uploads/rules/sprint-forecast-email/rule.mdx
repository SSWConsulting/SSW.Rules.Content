After the [Sprint Planning meeting](/what-happens-at-a-sprint-planning-meeting), it is useful for the Development Team to send the Product Owner (PO) a Sprint Forecast email 📩 for the next Sprint. Doing this helps to improve common understanding in, and sometimes to enforce, the relationship between the PO and the Team.

This is simply an agreement between the Development Team and the PO for one Sprint and should be confirmed via an email at the beginning of every Sprint.

<endIntro />

> “The implementation team agrees to do its best to deliver an agreed on set of features (scope) to a defined quality standard by the end of the Sprint. (Ideally they deliver what they promised, or even a bit more). The Product Owner agrees not to change his instructions before the end of the Sprint.”

Each Sprint in a Scrum project can be considered a mini-project that has **time** (Sprint Length), **scope** (Sprint Backlog), **quality** ([Definition of Done](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/definition-of-done)) and **cost** (Team Size \* Sprint Length). Only the scope can vary and this is measured every Sprint.

You can improve the forecast by using AI tools 🤖 like Claude and Copilot to extract additional insights from a meeting transcript.
