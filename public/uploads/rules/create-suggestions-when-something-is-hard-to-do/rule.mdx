One of our goals is to make the job of the developer as easy as possible. If you have to write a lot of code for something that you think you should not have to do, you should make a suggestion and add it to the relevant page.

If you have to add a suggestion, make sure that you put the link to that suggestion into the comments of your code.

/// <summary>
/// base class for command implementations
/// This is a work around as standard MVVM commands
/// are not provided by default.

public class Command : ICommand
{
 // code
}
```

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={{
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: 'Figure: Bad example - The link to the suggestion should be in the comments',
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />
