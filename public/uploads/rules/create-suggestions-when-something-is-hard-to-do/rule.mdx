One of our goals is to make the job of the developer as easy as possible. If you have to write a lot of code for something that you think you should not have to do, you should make a suggestion and add it to the relevant page.

If you have to add a suggestion, make sure that you put the link to that suggestion into the comments of your code.

```cs
/// <summary>
/// base class for command implementations
/// This is a work around as standard MVVM commands
/// are not provided by default.
/// </summary>
public class Command : ICommand
{
 // code
}
```
**❌ Figure: Bad example - The link to the suggestion should be in the comments**  

```cs
/// <summary>
/// base class for command implementations
/// This is a work around as standard MVVM commands
/// are not provided by default.
/// </summary>
///
/// <remarks>
///  Issue Logged here: https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Rules/issues/3
///</remarks>
public class Command : ICommand
{
 // code
}
```
**✅ Figure: Good example - When you link to a suggestion everyone can find it and vote it up**
