Since .NET 5+, the choice between using String.Empty and "" is a stylistic decision for the team. In .NET Framework, "" is less efficient than String.Empty from a memory perspective which can result in better performance due to faster garbage collection.

From the team that worked on performance in .NET: [String.Empty vs "" in modern .NET language](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxIv8HnqTApTo6VOuEvBkAx3VnjY6RioCh)

```csharp
public string myString

{
 get
 {
 return ;
 }

}
```
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Figure: Bad code if used in .NET Framework. Low performance",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


```csharp
public string myString
{

 get

 {

 return string.Empty;

 }

}
```
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "Figure: Good code if used in .NET Framework. Higher performance",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


We have a program called [SSW Code Auditor](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/Rules.aspx#StringEmpty) to check for this rule.
