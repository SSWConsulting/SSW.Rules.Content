seoDescription: Ensure your tables have consistent row heights for a professional
  appearance in all reports.

type: rule
uri: consistent-height-of-table-row

Same height of table row across all reports gives users consistent and professional impression.

We use the default height of table row (0.63492cm) as a standard to make sure all tables in our reports have consistent row height.

This rule also applies to height of Textbox in all reports.
