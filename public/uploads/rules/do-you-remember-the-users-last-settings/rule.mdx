  </>}
/>
* Login forms - the last login name should be the Default selected and the cursor should be in the password box.

    figure: "Good Example - Last Username is saved",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/GoodFormLogin.jpg"
/>

* Report criteria forms - e.g. date start and date end fields should be automatically populated

How do I store the settings?

* .NET: Use the
  [Configuration Block](/do-you-use-configuration-management-application-block) to store the settings.
* Access: Use a local table called 'Control' with one record.
