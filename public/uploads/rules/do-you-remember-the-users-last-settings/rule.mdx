The user's last settings should be saved and should be selected as the Default the next time a form is opened in many instances. For example:

<!--endintro-->

* Login forms - the last login name should be the Default selected and the cursor should be in the password box.

:::

::: good

:::

* Report criteria forms - e.g. date start and date end fields should be automatically populated

How do I store the settings?

* .NET: Use the
  [Configuration Block](/do-you-use-configuration-management-application-block) to store the settings.
* Access: Use a local table called 'Control' with one record.
