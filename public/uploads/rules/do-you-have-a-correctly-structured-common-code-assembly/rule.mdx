Your common code assembly should be divided into the following sections:

 <endOfIntro />

- **Common** (e.g. SSW.Framework.Common)
  - Code which is not UI specific
  - Example: Code to convert a date into different formats
- **CommonWindows** (e.g. SSW.Framework.WindowsUI)
  - Example: Base forms which are the same for all products, wizard frameworks
- **CommonWeb** (e.g. SSW.Framework.WebUI)
  - Example: Generic XML-based navigation components
