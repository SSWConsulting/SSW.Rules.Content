If you find a mistake in a file hosted on GitHub, don’t just fix it blindly - check who made the change and why. This helps you understand the context and gives you the chance to inform the contributor if a correction is needed.

GitHub makes it easy to view a file's version history, compare changes, and even see discussions around each commit.

## Viewing changes to a file in GitHub

1. Navigate to the file in the repository on GitHub

   
<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "File within GitHub UI",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/view-file-changes-in-github/github-file.png"
/>

2. Click on the "History" button (clock icon) at the top right of the file view. You’ll see a list of commits that modified this file

   
<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "GitHub history button",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/view-file-changes-in-github/github-history-button.png"
/>

3. Click on a commit to view the **diff** - the [changes between two file versions](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/viewing-and-comparing-commits/differences-between-commit-views), showing what was added, deleted, or changed

   
<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "Select a commit from the list",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/view-file-changes-in-github/github-commit-viewer.png"
/>

   
<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "default",
    figure: "View the changes made",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/view-file-changes-in-github/github-diff-view.png"
/>

    If you're working locally, you can also run the following commands to view the exact changes within the terminal.

```shell
git log -- path/to/file
git show &lt;commit-hash&gt;
```
  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: "XXX",
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
