Intro

<endIntro />

When you develop a macOS application and distribute it outside the Mac App Store, users will often see a security warning the first time they try to open it. This happens because Gatekeeper cannot identify the application’s creator, so the app is treated as untrusted. While there are workarounds to bypass Gatekeeper, they require users to go through multiple manual and advanced steps, which is a poor user experience.

As the title suggests, removing this system warning involves two main steps:

1. Code signing (using a Developer ID Application certificate)
2. Notarization (submitting the app to Apple for automated security checks)

***

## Code-sign

To code-sign your application, you need to get a Developer ID Application certificate from Apple. The process starts by creating a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) using Keychain Access. The CSR proves ownership of a local signing key without exposing the private key itself. Apple uses this request to issue the Developer ID Application certificate.

### Preparation

Before you start, make sure you have:

1. Asked a SysAdmin to invite your SSW account to the SSW Apple Developer Team
2. A Mac with Keychain Access.app
3. Access to the Apple Developer Portal with the Account Holder's Apple ID (The main Apple ID of your orgnaization)

### Step 1: Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)

1. Use Spotlight to search for Keychain Access.
2. In the menu bar, select: Keychain Access → Certificate Assistant → Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority…
