  when it kicks in?

Of course, all your servers are on UPS - Uninterruptible Power Supply. If not they should be!

How do you know that all the money you paid for a UPS was worth it? How many times has it saved our servers? How long do the batteries last for before they go flat? Why was a server off when you came in in the morning?

<endIntro />

A UPS is a device that provides backup power to your servers and other critical equipment in the event of a power outage. It ensures that your systems can continue to operate for a short period, allowing you to save work and safely shut down equipment if necessary. UPS units also protect against power surges and other electrical disturbances.

If you get your UPS to email you when an event occurs then you will have answers to these questions.
The problem is that there is no uniform software that will work with all UPS's as they all have their own format.
All UPS's come with management software or hardware that can perform these actions. You just need to set it up.

For example, your company might use APC UPS' and they have physical management cards (hardware), which are able to send emails. The event categories are "severe", "warning" and "informational".
