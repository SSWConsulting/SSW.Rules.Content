Sometimes a potential client contacts you and you are not the right person to deal with them. You need to hand them over to a sales person. There is usually no reason to call them. You can respond via email with:
  </>}

1. A clear instruction for the sales person to follow up
2. One action item for the sales person to follow (more than one action item or asking the prospect to complete a task can cause confusion and delay)
