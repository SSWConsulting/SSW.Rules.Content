seoDescription: Organize your website structure to keep it clean and efficient with
  separate directories for images, downloadable content, include files, executables,
  shopping cart pages, client login, reports, maintenance, and validation checks.
title: Do you have a structured website?
type: rule
uri: structured-website

The following structure allows you to keep your website clean of clutter:

<endOfIntro />

- **/Images** - for all static images
- **/Images/Dynamic** - for all images used in dynamically generated pages
  Note: The reason we recommend 2 images directories is so we can exclude images used by dynamically generated pages from our link checking program. This is so we can work out the **true** orphan images (they multiply quickly...like coat-hangers)
- **/Download** - [downloadable content](/centralize-downloadable-files), like PDFs and documents
- **/Includes** - for all include files
- **/Bin** - for mdb's, dll's and udl's
- **/Shop** - for the shopping basket and related pages
- **/Clients** - for the client login page and related pages
- **/Reports** - for any SQL Server Reporting Services
- **/zsMaintenance** - for the administration section to modify website settings
- **/zsValidate**  - for all web server status and validation checks

The root directory should be clean, having only:

- **default (.aspx, .asp, .htm)**
- **global.asa**
- **application.sln**
