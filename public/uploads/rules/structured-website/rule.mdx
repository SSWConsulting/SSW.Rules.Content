The following structure allows you to keep your website clean of clutter:
- **/Images** - for all static images
- **/Images/Dynamic** - for all images used in dynamically generated pages
  Note: The reason we recommend 2 images directories is so we can exclude images used by dynamically generated pages from our link checking program. This is so we can work out the **true** orphan images (they multiply quickly...like coat-hangers)
- **/Download** - [downloadable content](/centralize-downloadable-files), like PDFs and documents
- **/Includes** - for all include files
- **/Bin** - for mdb's, dll's and udl's
- **/Shop** - for the shopping basket and related pages
- **/Clients** - for the client login page and related pages
- **/Reports** - for any SQL Server Reporting Services
- **/zsMaintenance** - for the administration section to modify website settings
- **/zsValidate**  - for all web server status and validation checks

The root directory should be clean, having only:

- **default (.aspx, .asp, .htm)**
- **global.asa**
- **application.sln**
