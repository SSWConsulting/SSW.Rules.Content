Microsoft 365 groups - When anyone sends an email to a Microsoft 365 group (Office365 groups) e.g: <SysAdmins@Northwind.com> they don’t receive a copy of their own email, which is different from normal distribution groups.

<endIntro />

To change the behavior the user can use the checkbox Outlook | Settings | Additional Settings | Groups | ‘Send me a copy of the email I send to a group’.

Note: This can be enabled on the server side by doing a PowerShell script. This feature is turned on by default. Users can turn it off manually using the above steps to not receive a copy of a email sent to a Microsoft 365 group.

```powershell
# Connect to Exchange Online
Connect-ExchangeOnline -UserPrincipalName user@northwind.com

# Get the mailbox message configuration for a specific mailbox
Get-Mailbox user@northwind.com | Get-MailboxMessageConfiguration | Select EchoGroupMessageBackToSubscribedSender

# Enable the option to send a copy of the sent message to the sender's mailbox
$mailbox = Get-Mailbox -Identity "user@northwind.com" | Set-MailboxMessageConfiguration -EchoGroupMessageBackToSubscribedSender $true
```
