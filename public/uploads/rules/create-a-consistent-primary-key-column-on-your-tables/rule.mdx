<introEmbed
  body={<>
Make sure you created a consistent primary key column named **Id** on your tables.
  </>}
/>
```sql
Employee.ID, Employee.EmployeeId, Employee.EmployeeID, Employee.Employee_Code, Employee.Employee
```
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Figure: Bad example",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


```sql
Employee.Id
```
<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "Figure: Good example",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


### Why?

- We shouldn’t capitalise ID (identifier) as it is an abbreviation not an acronym.
- Using the approach \[TableName\]Id, e.g. EmployeeId, is redundant as we already know the context of the Id.
