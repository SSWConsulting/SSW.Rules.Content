Market analysis studies the attractiveness and the dynamics of a special market within a special industry. Through all these analyses, the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of a company can also be identified.

Market analysis should cover: all trends happening in the market, your market share, a competitor analysis, your potential customers, strategy and ROI plan, last but not least, intellectual property monetization opportunities (for example patents or copyrighted materials, such as written materials like books, computer codes, designs, and more).
