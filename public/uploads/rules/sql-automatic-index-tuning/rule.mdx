In SQL Server 2022 there are lots of features that make day to day database management much easier. These were introduced in SQL Server 2017 and are continually being improved. The Automatic Tuning features can either be used to make recommendations of changes to indexes and query plans, or it can be allowed to take control and make the recommended changes without user intervention.

In small organizations without a dedicated database administrator, turning these features on is strongly recommended. Also for less important servers it can free up the database administrator's time to deal with only the most business critical databases and servers.

See [detailed information on this feature](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/automatic-tuning/?WT.mc_id=DP-MVP-33518).
