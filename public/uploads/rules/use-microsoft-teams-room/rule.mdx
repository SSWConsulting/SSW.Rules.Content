## The pain

* **Wasted Time** - We've all been there - you step into a meeting room, only to find that the TV is off or the settings are incorrect. The precious minutes spent troubleshooting can disrupt the flow of your meetings and impact productivity
* **Complexity** - Modern meeting rooms are equipped with a variety of devices and software, making it challenging to ensure everything works seamlessly. The juggling act of remote controls, apps, and cables can lead to confusion and frustration
* **Missed Opportunities** - In today's fast-paced business world, every second counts. A delayed start or technical glitches can result in missed opportunities, whether it's a crucial client call or a collaborative brainstorming session
* **User Discomfort** - Users may feel uncomfortable or overwhelmed by technology issues, affecting their confidence and overall experience in the meeting room

## The solution - Microsoft Teams Rooms

Now, imagine a solution that eliminates these pain points, making every meeting a hassle-free and productive experience. Microsoft Teams Rooms offers user-friendly options to transform your meetings into smooth and efficient interactions.

Find more information on [Microsoft's website for Microsoft Teams Rooms](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-teams/microsoft-teams-rooms).

### The hardware

Before you think about Microsoft Teams Rooms, you need different pieces of hardware to be able to use it. This generally consists of:

* An intelligent camera
* Good microphones
* Speakers
* A touchscreen to control your call
* A small computer to run Microsoft Teams Rooms on, or a built-in system, where all the above is connected to.

These are generally sold by Microsoft Teams Rooms partners like [**Logitech](https://www.logitech.com/en-au/video-collaboration/partners/microsoft.html)**, **Yealink**, **Poly**, **Dell**, **Cisco**; and they are generally sold in bundles by room size: huddle/small, medium, large/boardrooms.

You can check out certified Teams Rooms devices at [Microsoft Teams Rooms Packages and Systems](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-teams/across-devices/devices/category/teams-rooms/20)

After you've acquired the gear, then it's time to see how to use your Microsoft Teams Rooms setup. In the scenarios below, let's pretend that TeamsRoom@northwind.com is the email address set for your Teams Rooms device.

### Option 1 - Start a call from Microsoft Teams Room

2. Change the HDMI output on your TV to the Microsoft Teams Rooms device, if not already.
3. On the Microsoft Teams Rooms touchscreen, click "Meet" to start a call.
4. Invite participants as needed.
5. Utilize the touchscreen for meeting controls, such as sharing content and adjusting settings.

2. Add TeamsRoom@northwind.com to the call, like you would invite anyone else.

### Bonus - Share your laptop screen
