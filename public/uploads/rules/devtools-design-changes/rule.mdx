Designers often struggle to explain small UI tweaks to developers using just words or screenshots. A request like "make the button pop" or "this feels off" can be interpreted in many ways. Without clear direction, developers are forced to guess, which leads to delays, frustration, and wasted effort on both sides.

Sharing short recordings of you live-editing a website in the browser’s DevTools significantly reduces design–dev iteration time.

## Show, don't tell

Instead of describing your design tweaks, demonstrate them. Use your browser's DevTools (e.g. Chrome or Edge) to live-edit the UI.

You can adjust paddings, margins, font sizes, colors, and layout styles directly in the browser. While doing this, record your screen and voice so others can see exactly what you changed and why.

This method gives the developer precise information in context, reducing ambiguity and miscommunication.

    ### Hi Chloe
    
    Adjust the navigation and header layout by modifying margin and padding settings to improve alignment and spacing.
    
    1. The navigation bar should have a consistent top margin
    2. The heading element should align with the breadcrumb and text inside the box

**✅ Video: Good example - The designer demonstrates and explains the change, giving the dev everything they need to implement it**

## When to use DevTools recordings

This technique is best for **small, visual changes** like:

* Adjusting padding/margins
* Tweaking text, colors, or spacing
* Changing alignment or hierarchy
* Proposing alternate layout ideas

## Why this technique works

* **Clarity** – The dev sees the exact change in place, eliminating guesswork
* **Efficiency** – Avoids multiple rounds of clarification
* **Precision** – CSS values and HTML structure are visible – no ambiguity
* **Collaboration** – You're making the dev's life easier (and your own)

## Tips to record

* **Narrate your intent** – Speak while recording: *“I’m increasing the font-size from 24px to 32px to improve readability.”*
* **Keep recordings short** – Aim for 1–3 minutes. Focus on one issue per video
* **Speak their language** – Editing in DevTools doesn’t require deep coding knowledge, but learning the basics helps a lot
* **Be direct** – Developers love it when designers provide specific, actionable feedback

## Tools for smooth recordings

* **Browser DevTools (F12)** – Use the "Elements" and "Styles" panels to adjust HTML and CSS on the fly
* **[YakShaver](https://yakshaver.ai)** – An AI tool that records your screen and voice (e.g. using Microsoft Teams), and generates a task automatically. Super useful for quick handovers
* **Loom / Zoom / OBS** – Any screen recorder works if you just need the recording file

## What about complex changes?

If your changes are significant (e.g. new components or complex interactions), consider instead:

* Creating a wireframe in Figma and [handing over mockups to developers](/hand-over-mockups-to-developers)
* [Prototyping the functionality with AI-assisted code](/ai-for-prototype-development)
