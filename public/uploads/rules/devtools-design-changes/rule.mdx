Designers often struggle to explain small UI tweaks to developers using only words or screenshots. Requests like “make the button pop” or “this feels off” are subjective and can be interpreted in multiple ways. Without clear direction, developers are forced to guess, leading to delays, frustration, and wasted effort on both sides.

Sharing short recordings of live browser edits using DevTools significantly reduces design–development iteration time by making changes explicit and easy to understand.

## Show, don't tell

Instead of describing a change, it can be shown. Browser DevTools in Chrome or Edge allow live edits to the UI. Padding, margins, font sizes, colours, and layout can be changed directly in the browser. Recording the screen and voice while doing this shows exactly what was changed and why.

This gives developers clear context and removes confusion.

    ### Hi Chloe
    
    Adjust the navigation and header layout by modifying margin and padding settings to improve alignment and spacing.
    
    1. The navigation bar should have a consistent top margin
    2. The heading element should align with the breadcrumb and text inside the box

## When to use DevTools recordings

This technique is best for **small, visual changes** like:

* Changing padding or margins
* Adjusting text size, colour, or spacing
* Fixing alignment
* Testing small layout ideas

## Why this technique works

* **Clear** – The developer can see the change in place
* **Fast** – Fewer follow-up questions
* **Exact** – Real CSS values are visible
* **Helpful** – Makes the handover easier for everyone

## Tips for recording

* **Explain the reason** – Explain what is being changed and why, for example: *“The font size is increased from 24px to 32px to improve readability.”*
* **Keep recordings short** – Aim for 1–3 minutes and focus on one issue per recording
* **Speak their language** – Basic CSS knowledge is enough
* **Be direct** – Developers respond best to specific, actionable feedback

## Tools for smooth recordings

* **[YakShaver](https://yakshaver.ai)** – An AI tool that records your screen and voice (e.g. using Microsoft Teams), and generates a task automatically. Super useful for quick handovers
* **Loom / Zoom / OBS** – Any screen recorder works if only a video file is required
* **Browser DevTools (F12)** – Use the "Elements" and "Styles" panels to adjust HTML and CSS on the fly

## What about complex changes?

For larger changes (e.g. new components or complex interactions), this approach may not be enough. 

In those cases, it is better to:

* Create wireframes in Figma and [hand over mockups to developers](/hand-over-mockups-to-developers)
* [Prototype the functionality with AI-assisted code](/ai-for-prototype-development)
