When collaborating within teams, the current process involves soliciting individual updates or feedback, with one team member responsible for manually compiling this information. Unfortunately, this method presents several challenges:

* The need for manual compilation of feedback/updates
* Time-consuming process
* The individual providing the original feedback must verify it, as it has been consolidated into a single file
* Any subsequent updates may necessitate the creation of a new version (v2) of the compiled file

Fortunately, Microsoft Loop offers a solution by introducing interactive notes shared seamlessly across all Microsoft 365 products. This addresses the challenges by eliminating the need for manual compilation, streamlining the process, and ensuring that updates are instantly accessible to all stakeholders.
