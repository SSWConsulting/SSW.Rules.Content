Qantas has introduced a flight upgrade initiative called ["Bid Now"](http://www.qantas.com/travel/airlines/upgrade/global/en) that allows members of their frequent flyer program to place a "bid" to get their Economy class bookings upgraded to Business class.

To make a bid, follow these simple steps:

<!--endintro-->

- Within 7 days of flying, visit the "Bid Now" page (if you've booked more than 7 days in advance, [use FollowUp Then to set a reminder for yourself](/do-you-follow-up-emails-effectively))
- Enter your last name and booking reference into the field provided
- You will be asked to nominate a "bid" (set amount frequent flyer points and/money) for the upgrade, as you would in a blind auction
- Within 24 hours of the flight, you will be notified if your bid was successful
