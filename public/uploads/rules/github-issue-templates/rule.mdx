## GitHub Issue Forms

You can take this a step further by creating Issue Forms - these are awesome for non-technical people who aren't comfortable with Markdown.

Check it out on [GitHub Issue Forms docs](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-issue-forms)
