When you make a change to your website, whether it's a new layout, a rewritten headline, or an updated CTA, it’s important to validate its impact with real user data.

Use a combination of tools to gather both **quantitative data** (Google Analytics) and **qualitative insights** (Hotjar and Microsoft Clarity). This way, you're not guessing how the change performed - you're measuring it from multiple perspectives.

## What to do

1. **Note the date of the change**

   * Record when the change went live (e.g. in your task tracker or changelog)
   * Select a time range to compare results (e.g. 30 days before and after the change)
2. **Compare the data (Quantitative)**

   Use [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) to check:

   * Pageviews
   * Bounce rate
   * Time on page
   * Conversions
   * Explorations in GA4 (if deeper analysis is needed)
3. **Watch how users behave (Qualitative)**

   Use [Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com/) and [Microsoft Clarity](https://clarity.microsoft.com/) to:

   * View session recordings
   * Check heatmaps for clicks and scrolls
   * Identify issues like rage clicks or confusion
   * Collect feedback through short surveys
4. **Write a summary**

   * Combine insights from all 3 tools
   * Share what worked, what didn’t, and what you'll improve next

    **Tip:** Google Analytics shows what changed, Hotjar shows how users interact, and Clarity highlights shows pain points.
