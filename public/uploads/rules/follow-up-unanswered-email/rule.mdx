seoDescription: Following up on an unanswered email requires a gentle yet persistent
  approach. Use "(PING)" to initiate a response, and if needed, add context while
  still keeping the tone friendly.
title: Do you know how to follow up an unanswered email?
type: rule
uri: follow-up-unanswered-email

Sometimes the person you have sent an email to may not reply promptly. They might be too busy or just have forgotten about it.

<endOfIntro />

If you need an answer, remind them by:

1. Sending an IM with the words "**(PING) - &#123;&#123; EMAIL SUBJECT &#125;&#125;**"

If you still get no response, then:

2. Reply to the email thread:
   - Add "**(PING)**" in 1<sup>st</sup> line of the body
   - Feel free to include any other useful information, such as _"following-up as this is blocking another task"_ or _"need an answer before the end of the Sprint"_ or _"it's been 2 months and I'm wondering what is the status of this task"_
   - Remember to always reply to all
   - Make sure to **not** duplicate the task(s) - the person will see it in the history of the thread

Of course you should use a friendlier tone when following up a client or a third party compared with following up a colleague.

If it's really important and you need an answer you might like to [consider using the phone instead of email](/call-first-before-emailing).
