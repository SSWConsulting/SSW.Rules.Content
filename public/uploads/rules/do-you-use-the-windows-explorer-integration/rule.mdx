1. Install the TFS Power Tools
2. When you install this, make sure you do a 'Custom Install', and select the 'Shell Integration' option (this is off by default)

![Use Windows Explorer](/uploads/rules/do-you-use-the-windows-explorer-integration/TFS_WE_01.jpg) Figure: Using Windows Explorer for your source control is a dream (great for designers too - who don't want to use VS.NET)
Suggestion to the TFS Team: I didn't see blame annotate in the drop down - which is a bit odd.
