seoDescription: Silverlight applications should avoid using Thread.Sleep as it causes
  UI thread to sleep and application becomes non-responsive. Instead, use a Storyboard
  with a duration to delay execution of code.

  body={<>
Calling Thread.Sleep on your Silverlight application causes the UI thread to sleep. That means the application is not responsive.

If you want to delay something, you can use a [storyboard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.media.animation.storyboard?view=windowsdesktop-7.0&redirectedfrom=MSDN&WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-33518).

Thread.Sleep(5000);

this.Dispatcher.BeginInvoke(new Action(() =>
  {
    // Try to reconnect in the background
    Connect.Execute(null);
  }));

    Connect.Execute(null);
  }));
sb.Begin();
