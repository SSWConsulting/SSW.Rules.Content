Calling Thread.Sleep on your Silverlight application causes the UI thread to sleep. That means the application is not responsive.

If you want to delay something, you can use a [storyboard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.media.animation.storyboard?view=windowsdesktop-7.0&redirectedfrom=MSDN&WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-33518).

```cs
Thread.Sleep(5000);

this.Dispatcher.BeginInvoke(new Action(() =>
  {
    // Try to reconnect in the background
    Connect.Execute(null);
  }));
```

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "badExample",
  figure: "Code: Bad example - Using Thread.Sleep() causes your Silverlight application to freeze",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />


```cs
Storyboard sb = new Storyboard() { Duration = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5) };
sb.Completed += (ds, de) => this.Dispatcher.BeginInvoke(new Action(() =>
  {
    // Try to reconnect in the background
    Connect.Execute(null);
  }));
sb.Begin();
```

<figureEmbed figureEmbed={ {
  preset: "goodExample",
  figure: "Code: Good example - Use a Storyboard with a duration of the delay and once the Storyboard is finished running",
  shouldDisplay: true
} } />
