When managing dependencies in a javascript project, selecting the right versioning symbols like `^`, `~`, or `*` can make a big difference in your project's stability. This guide helps you understand what these symbols mean and how to use them effectively.

## Why version symbols matter

Dependency management is critical for maintaining stability, security, and compatibility in your project. Using the wrong symbol can result in unexpected updates, breaking changes, or missing out on important fixes.

## Semantic versioning (SemVer) refresher

npm uses **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**, structured as:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "react" : "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH"
  }
```

* **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
* **MINOR**: Backward-compatible new features
* **PATCH**: Backward-compatible bug fixes

Understanding SemVer helps you understand the common version symbols below. Learn more about [semantic versioning](/semantic-versioning)

## 🎯 Symbols cheat sheet

### 1. Caret (`^`)

Allows **minor** and **patch** updates.

**Example:** `^1.0.0` matches `>=1.0.0` and `<2.0.0`.

### 2. Tilde (`~`)

Allows only **patch** updates.

**Example:** `~1.0.0` matches `>=1.0.0` and `<1.1.0`.

### 3. Wildcard (`*`)

Matches **any** version.

**Example:** `*` installs the latest version.

## What happens behind the scenes?

When you run `npm install`, npm resolves the version of the dependency based on the range specified in your `package.json`. It installs the latest version that satisfies the range and then locks that exact version in the `package-lock.json` file. This ensures future installs use the same version, even if newer versions are released (unless you delete `node_modules` or the `package-lock.json` file and re run `npm install`).

## 💡 Best practices

* Use **`^` (caret)** only when you trust the package maintainers
* Use **`~` (tilde)** when you want only patch updates for bug fixes
* Avoid **wildcards (`*`)** for production projects
* Lock exact versions for critical applications to ensure stability

By understanding these symbols, you can avoid unexpected error and keep your project on track! 🚀
