There should never be a command line utility without a UI. Take an example of Visual Studio 2008:

<endIntro />

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="bad"
  figure="Bad example - In website project, Visual Studio does not have a UI for its command line"
  src="/uploads/rules/ui-for-a-command-line-utility/commandlinewithoutui.jpg"
/>


<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figurePrefix="good"
  figure="Good example - In web application project, Visual Studio provides a UI for its command line"
  src="/uploads/rules/ui-for-a-command-line-utility/commandlinewithui.jpg"
/>
