Using the Scrum template has its fair share of cool perks:

**Terminology:** The work item types and states are all in Scrum-speak, which helps everyone on the team get on the same page quickly.

**Consistency:** It keeps things uniform across projects, so jumping in and out or teaming up is a breeze.

Azure DevOps does have other templates like Agile and CMMI, but the Scrum template has a special spot. It sticks to the Scrum playbook, making it a go-to for teams keen on keeping the Scrum spirit alive. It's all about boosting agility, making chats flow easily, and letting new folks blend in without a hitch.
