A spanner might get a plumber through 90% of jobs, but he'll get stuck on the last 10% if he doesn't carry anything else.
Microsoft tools are the most important tools we have, but they only cover the first 90%. We may spend most time using Outlook, Visual Studio .NET, SQL Server Management Studio. However Microsoft tools don't do everything.

Rather than spending our time recreating the wheel, we should always look out for non-Microsoft options or extensions that will save us time.
