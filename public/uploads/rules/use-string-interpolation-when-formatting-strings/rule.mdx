String Interpolation - greatly reduces the amount of boilerplate code required when working with strings
Formatting strings on the fly was previously a task which required a stack of boilerplate code

<endOfIntro />

```cs
var s = String.Format("Profit is ${0} this year", p.TotalEarnings - p.Totalcost);
```

::: bad

```cs
var s = "Profit is ${p.TotalEarnings - p.Totalcost} this year";
```
