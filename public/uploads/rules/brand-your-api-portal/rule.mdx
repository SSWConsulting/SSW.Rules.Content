Azure API Management provides a **Developer Portal** where the automated API documentation can be provided using your own corporate branding.

If you are looking to sell access to your APIs, this is a fantastic feature because you can combine your corporate identity into the user interface that your customers will be seeing.

<endIntro />

The Developer Portal is open-source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/api-management-developer-portal) and you can even [host it yourself](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-developer-portal?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-33518).

Microsoft already provides a very nice [tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-developer-portal-customize?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-33518) for how to customize your API Management Developer Portal.

Watch Adam Cogan and William Liebenberg discuss the benefits.
