  body={<>
1. ~~If your app is built on Silverlight today.~~ Stop building things on Silverlight today.
  </>}
/>
2. Reasons are:
    * Time to market
    * Lower cost
    * Reuse MVVM
    * Reuse Silverlight controls
    * Reuse the Business and Data layer

3. The Biggest thing going for windows phone is:

    * .NET dev shops
    * Environment more productive than xcode

    Note: WP7 is built on Silverlight 3 (not Silverlight 4)
    Note: WP7 was built by a 'web team' not "Rich client app team', so some issues exist:

    * Bing map control relies on host page (authentication)
    * Avoid using System.Windows.Browser.dll in your Silverlight App (as it works only
                        OOB on desktop) and you will have to use a different control on Windows Phone 7
4. Others reasons are:
    * You can deploy your app without going through the appstore/market place. E.g. my SSW business app
