At a high level, the plan is:

<endIntro />

- Choose your SharePoint Online Plan (for most companies already included in o365 plan)

[Compare SharePoint Online options](https://products.office.com/en-us/sharepoint/compare-sharepoint-plans)

- Choose a migration tool to help you migrate the content online

i.e. at SSW we use Sharegate

- Install the migration tool

- Migration tool - Configure connections to your source and target SharePoint site collections
- Migration tool - Migrate your content
  - Structure migration and content (dry-run)
  - Analyse result reports
  - Fix potential errors and warnings (repeat until you get to zero - see rule #2)
  - Structure migration and content (for real)
- Remove permissions on your on-premises SharePoint site(s) and give access to SharePoint Online
- After a week, decommission your on-premises farm
