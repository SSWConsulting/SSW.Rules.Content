If your Power Apps solution has any environment-specific configuration items, then an Environment Variable in the Solution gives you a configurable input parameter. Environment variables avoid hardcoding configuration information and having to keep track of and change configuration data when importing a solution.

<endOfIntro />

Some of the benefits of using environment variables are:

* No need to manually edit configurable values in a production environment.
* Configure one or more variables in one place and reference like a parameter across multiple solution components.
* Enter different values while importing solutions to other environments.
* Update values without a code change.
* Granular level security managed by Common Data Service.
* Unlimited number of variables (max solution size is 29 MB).
* Service the definitions and the values independently or together.
* Supported by Solution Packager and DevOps tools enable continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).
* Support for localization.
* Can be used to control feature flags and other application settings.
