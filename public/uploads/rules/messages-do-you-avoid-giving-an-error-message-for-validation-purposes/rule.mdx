If you do a search and no matches are found, display a message indicating zero results were returned rather than an error message.

![Bad Example - No matches found on searching is not an "Error"](/InappropriateError.gif)
  </>}
/>
However, a user thinks that either:

1. They have done something wrong (i.e. they are incompetent) OR
2. The software is broken (i.e. your application is incompetent)

Forcing the user into this opinion is a good way to make them avoid using your software in the future.

Instead, use the term "Information" when validation is required.
