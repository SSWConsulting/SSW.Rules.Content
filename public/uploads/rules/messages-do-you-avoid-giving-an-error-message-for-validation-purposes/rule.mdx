If you do a search and no matches are found, display a message indicating zero results were returned rather than an error message.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "badExample",
    figure: "Bad Example - No matches found on searching is not an \"Error\"",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }

<endOfIntro />

However, a user thinks that either:

1. They have done something wrong (i.e. they are incompetent) OR
2. The software is broken (i.e. your application is incompetent)

Forcing the user into this opinion is a good way to make them avoid using your software in the future.

Instead, use the term "Information" when validation is required.

<imageEmbed
  alt="Image"
  size="large"
  showBorder={false}
  figureEmbed={ {
    preset: "goodExample",
    figure: "Good Example - Only use \"Error\" when appropriate",
    shouldDisplay: true
  } }
  src="/uploads/rules/messages-do-you-avoid-giving-an-error-message-for-validation-purposes/AppropriateMessage.gif"
