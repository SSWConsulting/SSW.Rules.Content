title: Do you have a nice video background?
type: rule
uri: video-background

You are likely to have constant Teams or Zoom video calls with clients or work colleagues. One of the first things you should think about should be how to have a nice background.

<endIntro />

## Home offices

For home offices, follow "less is more" - A neutral background, good lighting, and a clutter-free space can significantly enhance the quality of your video.

* Have a neutral wall or setup behind you or with minimal objects - you may be fond of family pictures or band posters, but the person on the other side may be distracted
* Check you don't have a pile of clothes to fold, boxes, or any mess that may be behind your desk
* [Good lighting](/have-good-lighting-on-your-home-office) can improve the general quality of your video
* If you want to go the extra mile, designate one wall as your company wall and keep it consistent with the company branding

## On-site offices

When you're in the office, it's easy to have a professionally branded background, which remains the most effective option.

### Virtual/Blur backgrounds (⚠️ not preferred)

Ideally you should have a clean, professional background (like in an office).

While **not** preferred, virtual/blur backgrounds can be used when your background has unavoidable clutter or distracting elements. The virtual/blur effect should be your last resort - only use it when your physical background is genuinely unprofessional.
