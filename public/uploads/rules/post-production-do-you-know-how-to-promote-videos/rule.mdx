4. **Contact strategic partners** - The best way to extend your reach and promote a video is through strategic partners. These are people, companies or websites which don’t compete with you but service the same audience. Examples of these types of partners are:

   * Blogger in your industry
   * Industry websites
   * If you are an accountant, partner with a financial planner, business coach, insurance salesman or prestige car dealer
   * Suppliers
   * Industry experts

   You should ask the partner to:

   * Email the video to their list
   * Write a blog post on their blog
   * Update their social media accounts with a link and description of the video

   You should have a list of these partners in a database with all their contact details to automate the process of promoting your videos.
