<introEmbed

When we configure networks we give all computers in the company a naming theme like:

- Buildings
- Cars
- Countries
- Colours
- Fruits
- Vegetables, etc
  </>}

    At SSW we have adopted the **animal kingdom**.

    figure: 'We name the PCs and label them - this one is "Great Pyrenees"',
    shouldDisplay: true
  }}

  </>}
  figureEmbed={{
    preset: "default",
    figure: 'XXX',
    shouldDisplay: false
  }}
/>

While you are attaching the label, it is also a good idea to affix a business card to the underside of the computer. This way if you lose your machine, anyone who finds it can easily contact you.
