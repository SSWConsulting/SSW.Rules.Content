Teams Meeting chats are **only** visible to people who were invited to the meeting. If someone joins late or isn’t invited, they won’t see the previous conversation.

If others need to be part of the discussion or you want to continue the conversation after the meeting ends, **create a group chat instead**. 

<!--endintro-->

Group chats should be used when you want to:

* Include anyone you choose to the chat, regardless of meeting attendance

  * This is especially needed for [reaction polls](/easy-questions/#ask-for-reactions-for-multiple-options), where you may want to gather extra opinions or continue the discussion later.
* Show the full message history to everyone in the group
* Stay accessible in the Chats list on the left side of Teams

**Tip:** Start a group chat before the meeting and paste the meeting link inside. That way, everyone stays on the same page and the conversation continues seamlessly.
