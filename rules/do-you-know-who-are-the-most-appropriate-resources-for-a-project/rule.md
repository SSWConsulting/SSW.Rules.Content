<p>Most companies have staff <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/standards/Forms/ConsultingOrderTermsConditions.aspx">varying in experience and price</a>. </p>
<p>
                    While all staff pass strict recruitment procedures including technical and communication assessments, all staff
                    have different skill sets. For example, some have a broader level of knowledge and some are more proficient at project 
                    management.

                    When determining which staff are appropriate for which projects you need to analyse​ the needs of the project.
                    Some may not require management skills, (for example if we are providing resources to another technical
                    organization), while some projects may require only a narrow field of knowledge,&#160;(e.g. creating reports).&#160;</p><p>                    For any major project, a broad spectrum of individuals may be required which will utilize each level of staff.
