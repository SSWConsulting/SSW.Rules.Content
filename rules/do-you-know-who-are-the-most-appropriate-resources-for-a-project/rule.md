Most companies have staff [varying in experience and price](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/standards/Forms/ConsultingOrderTermsConditions.aspx).

While all staff pass strict recruitment procedures including technical and communication assessments, all staff                     have different skill sets. For example, some have a broader level of knowledge and some are more proficient at project                      management.

When determining which staff are appropriate for which projects you need to analyse the needs of the project.                     Some may not require management skills, (for example if we are providing resources to another technical                     organization), while some projects may require only a narrow field of knowledge,Â (e.g. creating Xamarin forms).

For any major project, a broad spectrum of individuals may be required which will utilize each level of staff.
