<p>​While working in a team, there are three ways of seeing others' or team calendars.​<br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3" style="text-align:left;">Option 1: Using Outlook Calendar Permissions - See a person's calendar<br></h3><p>You can share your Outlook calendar with another person or a group in Outlook. This option is useful when you want to share your personal calendar with others.<br></p><p>See <a href=/calendar-do-you-allow-full-access-to-calendar-admins>https://rules.ssw.com.au/calendar-do-you-allow-full-access-to-calendar-admins</a> for step by step instructions on how​ to share your calendar or see another person's shared calendar.<br></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Option 2: Using the Dynamics 365 CRM Service Calendar - See everyone's calendar<br></h3><p>When you want to see what's your colleague is doing, you can use the CRM Service Calendar.<br></p><p>This can keep track of important things like client w​ork and leave. See <a href=/scheduling-do-you-know-how-to-book-developers-for-a-project target="_blank">Scheduling - Do you know how to book developers for a project?</a> on how to add a booking to CRM Service Calendar.<br></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The CRM Service Calendar is deprecated; Microsoft are now moving to Dynamics Universal Resource Scheduling <br><br><img src="ServiceCalendar.png" alt="ServiceCalendar.png" style="width:750px;height:454px;" /></p><dl class="image"><dd>Figure: The CRM Service Calendar shows everyone's booked in client work and leave</dd></dl><blockquote style="margin:0px 0px 0px 40px;border:none;padding:0px;text-align:left;"></blockquote><p> 
   <b>Note:</b> This will only show appointments that have been tracked in CRM. 
   <br></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3" style="text-align:left;">Option 3: Using SharePoint's calendars - See a team's calendar<br></h3><p>You can also create a calendar in SharePoint which will be shared with the team on that SharePoint site. By sharing a calendar using SharePoint, new developers who have just joined the team can immediately look at the project's events (e.g. Daily Scrum meeting).<br></p><p>In this scenario, the scrum master of "SSWSugarLearning" wants to share the calendar called "Team Calendar" with his team.<br></p><p>To share a team calendar, you just need to give the calendar URL to the person in your team.<br>​E.g. https://sswcom.sharepoint.com/sites/SSWSugarLearning391/Lists/Team%20Calendar/calendar.aspx</p><p>
   <strong>Tip: </strong>You can also connect the SharePoint calendar to your Outlook. Here's how to do that:

   </dt><dd>Figure: In SharePoint 2016: On the "Calendar" tab, click "Connect to Outlook" to show the calendar in your Outlook account<br></dd></dl>
