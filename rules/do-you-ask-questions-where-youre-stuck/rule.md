 <p>
                    Many developers sit with their faces to the screen, isolating themselves from
                    the team, trying to solve a problem on their own. If you're stuck on one bug for
                    more than an hour, ask someone to help.
                </p>

<p>No-one gets a medal for solving a problem
                    on their own in 2 days, when it could've been solved by 2 people in a couple of
                    hours.</p><p>​The <a href="/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/DailyStandUpScrum.aspx">Daily Standup</a>​ is a good time to bring up any ongoing issues or sticking points if you haven't already.<br></p>
