Imagine you see one port of a hub not working, what do you do?

When you see something not working like a phone or a power point, don't ignore it. Instead create a PBI or YakShave it and attach a short note showing the item is out of order and the PBI number.

<!--endintro-->

This shouldnt be a large task - prepare a quick note form that reminds you what is broken, who you have to call to fix it and any additional details that may required to ensure the item is fixed properly or replaced.

**Tip:** Sticky notes work great! ✏️

When reporting a defect, always make sure your message is **clear**, **complete**, and **actionable**.  

## Create a PBI (YakShave it)

At SSW we created a Maintenance Backlog to keep track of all defects.  

Read Rule: Do you know the best way to report an office defect?

* For traceability, **create a PBI (Product Backlog Item)** in your maintenance backlog titled “Defect – \[Brief Description]”  
* Link the PBI in your message so others can track progress and updates\
  **Example:** “Created PBI: [Defect – Broken window in backlog area](#)”
