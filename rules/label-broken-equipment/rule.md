Imagine you see one port of a hub not working, what do you do?

When you see something not working like a phone or a power point, don't ignore it. Instead, create a PBI (or even better [YakShave it](https://yakshaver.ai)) and attach a short note showing the item is out of order and the PBI number.

<!--endintro-->

This shouldnt be a large task. Prepare a quick note (sticky notes work great!) form that reminds you what is broken, who you have to call to fix it and any additional details that may required to ensure the item is fixed properly or replaced.

When reporting a defect, always make sure your message is **clear**, **complete**, and **actionable**.  

## Use a Maintenance Backlog

It is a good idea to create a **Maintenance Backlog** to keep track of all defects. Learn more on [the best way to report an office defects](/report-defects).
