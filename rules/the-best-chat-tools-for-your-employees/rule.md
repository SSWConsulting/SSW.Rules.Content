There are many tools used to communicate and collaborate online. The most efficient platforms for chats and calls are:

<!--endintro-->

* [**Teams**](https&#58;//products.office.com/en-ca/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software)
* **[Skype](https&#58;//www.skype.com/)**
* **[Slack](https&#58;//slack.com/)**


We think [Yammer](https&#58;//www.yammer.com/) could soon be decommissioned to reduce confusion.

In China:

* **[WeChat](https&#58;//web.wechat.com/)**  (personal)
* **[DingTalk](https&#58;//www.dingtalk.com/en)**  (businesses)
