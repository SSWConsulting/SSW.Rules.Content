Good quality automated tests can help your development to continue more quickly and with more safety.

Gating deployments on the successful outcomes of your automated test suites can prevent you from automatically pushing bad code into production.

Depending on your automated tests to make deployment/release decisions means that your test code must be of excellent quality.
