Good quality automated tests can help your development to continue more quickly and with more safety.

Gating deployments on the successful outcomes of your automated test suites can prevent you from automatically pushing bad code into production.

Depending on your automated tests to make deployment/release decisions means that your test code must be of excellent quality.

You're writing (automated test) code because you, legitimately, have doubts about other (product) code. This means that this automated test code is as important as the production code (maybe even more important!). 

The test code should be treated as a first-class citizens. So, all of your coding best practices (e.g. clean coding, maintainability, performing code reviews, etc.) applies to test code as well.

tips:
add to DoD
code review it
use skilled devs, not people whose job doesn;t normally involve writing production code
