It is essential to clarify the purpose and time of meetings.
 When you commence each meeting you should ask the following two questions:  
<!--endintro-->

1. What are the points you want to cover in this meeting?
2. How long will this meeting be?


By asking these two questions you define both the client's and your expectations from the meeting; eliminating one of the factors which contribute to time-wastage.
