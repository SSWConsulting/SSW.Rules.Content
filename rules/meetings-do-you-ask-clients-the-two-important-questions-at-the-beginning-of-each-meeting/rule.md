It is essential to clarify the purpose and time of meetings. When you commence each meeting you should ask the following 2 questions:

<!--endintro-->

1. What are the points you want to cover in this meeting?
2. How long will this meeting be?

By asking these 2 questions you define both the client's and your expectations from the meeting; eliminating one of the factors which contribute to time-wastage.
