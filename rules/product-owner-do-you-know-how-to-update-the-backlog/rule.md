The Product Owner is responsible for owning the Product backlog. See the video on ["Do you know how to be a good Product Owner?"](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=a91de77d-a8dd-40be-b61a-bd6305e7183f)

There are three options for how to add new PBI (Product Backlog item) to the backlog:

<!--endintro-->

1. **Emails** 

::: bad
Bad Example - This is a poor way to add a PBI as you canâ€™t order emails by the business priority

:::
2. **Azure DevOps** - E.g. https://ssw.visualstudio.com
 ![](AzureDevOpsBacklog.png)


::: good
Figure: Good Example - Azure DevOps allows you to enter an item into the backlog, in any priority order  
:::


Note: You can also create a PBI using Azure DevOps and attach an email directly if needed, without using Team Companion
