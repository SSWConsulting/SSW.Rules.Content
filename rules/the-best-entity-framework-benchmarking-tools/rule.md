There are plenty of good benchmarking tools for .Net solutions.

<!--endintro-->

* BenchmarkDotNet is good because it monitors memory consumption and timings.
* Bombardier is a simple CLI load testing tool.
* NBomber is good for automating load tests

Try these out and there are more available. Which one suits will depend on your solution and what information you want.
