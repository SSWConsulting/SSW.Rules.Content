Sometimes you can’t resolve an issue without seeing the users' PC.

Luckily you can easily [share screens](/do-you-share-screens-when-working-remotely) and control the users' computer when calling from **Zoom** or **Microsoft Teams** but the functionality on the platforms is limited.

A full remote control experience is [TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/en-us/).
