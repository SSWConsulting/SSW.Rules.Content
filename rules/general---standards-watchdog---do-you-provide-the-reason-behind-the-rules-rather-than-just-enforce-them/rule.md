<span class='intro'> <p>​​If you criticize&#160;your staff&#58;<br></p><ul><li>You don't make lasting changes<br></li><li>They will resent you, resulting in lower productivity and&#160;employee morale</li></ul> </span>

<p>For example&#58; If one of your responsibilities is to make sure all your developers sent &quot;test please&quot;&#160;emails, you can run around with a lot of authority telling them they'd better comply, but at soon as you're not around, they will resent you and not bother about it.</p><p>A better approach is, when you see developers not sending &quot;test please&quot;&#160;emails, explain that they save time by getting early feedback, allowing bugs to be fixed while it's still fresh in the developers'&#160;minds. Explain to them that the cost of a bug increases over time.​</p><div><dl class="image"><dt>
