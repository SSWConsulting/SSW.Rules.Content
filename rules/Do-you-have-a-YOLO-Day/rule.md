# Do you have a YOLO Day

Different businesses have different benefits for their staff. It is important to make sure employees hardwork is acknowledged and appreciated. 
Some businesses provide extra leave days or salary sacrifice options or free training. You should consider the environment and effectiveness of your benefit provided to staff.
Additionally, the benefit has to be cost effective for the business in order for it to be sustainable. 

For example, Zendesk provides a 3 months paid paternity/maternity leave for their staff however, not all small businesses can afford this level of benefit.  

A great work around that is both beneficial to staff and cost-effective for the business is to provide an encouraged day off work per financial year to promote a fun day out 
for the staff. At SSW, we have coined this YOLO Day based on the phrase 'You Only Live Once'. 

YOLO Day should be incentivised for staff to do something productive or fun (e.g. skydiving, windsurfing or house hunting). This is also a great way to allow for staff to share
their experiences with fellow colleagues or friends, whilst promoting the benefits available from their business.
