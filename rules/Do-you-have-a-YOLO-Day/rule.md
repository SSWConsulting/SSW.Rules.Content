# Do you have a YOLO Day

Different businesses have different benefits for their staff. It is important to make sure employee's hard work is acknowledged and appreciated. 
Some businesses provide extra leave days, salary sacrifice options or free training. You should consider the environment and effectiveness of your benefit provided to staff.
Additionally, the benefit has to be cost effective for the business in order for it to be sustainable. 

For example, Zendesk provides a 3 months paid paternity/maternity leave for their staff however, not all small businesses can afford this level of benefit.  

A great workaround that is both beneficial to staff and cost-effective for the business is to provide an encouraged day off per financial year to promote a fun day out. At SSW, we have coined this YOLO Day based on the phrase 'You Only Live Once'. 

Staff shouold be incentivised to use their YOLO Day to do something productive or fun (e.g. skydiving, windsurfing or house hunting). Then they can share their experiences with fellow colleagues or friends, whilst promoting the benefits available from their place of employment. 

An extra day of unaccruable leave ideally should not damage the business financially and in turn can be promoted within your Employment Procedures or Guidelines as part of recruitment or as a marketing tool for promoting work life balance.
