<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>It's very important that your links stand out from the background as well as the surrounding text. A solid underline and a contrasting color is the usually the best choice, but the exact method is not important as long as the end result stands out. A link should not only be discoverable upon accidental hovering.</p><p>Rollovers are important as they offer visual feedback to a user that this link that will take them somewhere. While there is a myriad of ways to do this; you can't go wrong with an underline or border-bottom.</p><dl class="badImage"><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">For more information on this, please <a href="https://www.ssw.com.au/" style="border-bottom:none;color:inherit;">go to SSW website</a>.<br></p><dd>Bad Example: The link is hard to recognize<br></dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">For more information on this, please <a href="https://www.ssw.com.au/">go to SSW website</a>. <br></p><dd>Good Example: This link is obvious<br><br></dd><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">​
