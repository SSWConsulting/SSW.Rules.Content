There are a myriad of video formats and codecs that exist for all project types. It’s important for your project to use the correct format depending on what it is you are doing and what you want to achieve with your video.
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
Most, if not all, modern video cameras sold today record at HD resolution. Many now record full HD (1080p) which allows you to get even greater detail. Also, modern compression types allow you to ‘squeeze’ the large amounts of data that would normally take up gigabytes of storage right down to something that can be streamed over the web, without too much loss of fidelity. Because of the ease of recording and compressing down HD video, it seems like a no brainer that videos should be produced in HD rather than SD. Once you have your videos recorded and edited using Adobe Premiere Pro, you need to choose an appropriate export setting. Assuming you’re making the video for web, here is what you need set as your pre-set for best quality ‘HD’ video while maintaining a small file size&#58; <ul><li>Select H.264 as your format</li>
<li>Since you're uploading to web, select 'YouTube Widescreen HD' as your pre-set</li>
<li>In the video tab, select &quot;Frame Rate&quot; and select '25'</li>
<li>In the same Video tab, under Bitrate Settings, make your Maximum Bitrate '5'</li>
<li>In the Audio tab, under Bitrate Settings, select a Bitrate of 192kbps</li>
<li>Save this pre-set and give it an appropriate name.</li>
<li>Lastly, click on the &quot;Queue&quot; tab at the bottom of the window to send your project to Adobe Encoder.<div class="ms-rtestate-read ms-rte-wpbox"><div id="div_6da05f43-9383-4c97-8edd-168957732bc1" class="ms-rtestate-notify  ms-rtestate-read 6da05f43-9383-4c97-8edd-168957732bc1"></div><span id="__publishingReusableFragment"></span>
