When an organisation expands to having multiple offices or operates on a consulting basis, corporate cards may be issued to various office managers to provide relevant amenities 
for their respective office or for client related costs. 

Issuing cards can be both an administrative and financial burden. Administratively, the accountant needs to be able to reconcile the costs used against the corporate card and ensure
they are of relevant business expenses. Financially, card limits and spend amounts needs to be checked and reviewed regularly to avoid overspending uneccessarily. 

To assist the accountant with any administrative burdens, the office manager (or the office assistant) should record or file all spend receipts to the accountant within a week of the card being used. The best way to file these receipts is to use the company's expense receipts app. This allows for the disposal of the receipts and to maintain a digital copy.

Depending on the rule of your organisation, office managers should have some level of approval powers e.g. up to $100 can be approved by the office managers. Other alternatives could be that 2 office managers together can approve up to $500 or alternatively everything must be approved by 1 person such as the accountant. Based on the rule, the expense app should be set up in that manner so expenses are reviewed and processed accordingly.

> By using an expense app, the accountant obtains the digital copy of the receipt which should match to the relevant transaction in the bank statement lines within the accounting system and allow for faster reconciliations.
