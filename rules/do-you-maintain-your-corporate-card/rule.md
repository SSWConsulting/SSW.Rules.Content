When an organisation expands to having multiple offices or operates on a consulting basis, corporate cards may be issued to various office managers to provide relevant amenities 
for their respective office or for client related costs. 

Issuing cards can be both an administrative and financial burden. Administratively, the accountant needs to be able to reconcile the costs used against the corporate card and ensure
they are of relevant business expenses. Financially, card limits and spend amounts needs to be checked and reviewed regularly to avoid overspending uneccessarily. 

To assist the accountant with any administrative burdens, the office manager (or the office assistant) should record or file all spend receipts to the accountant within a week of 
the card being used. The best way to file these receipts is to use the company's expense receipts app. This allows for the disposal of the receipts and to maintain a digital copy.



> Note: if your business does not use any mobile app for expense receipts, SSW has compared 3 apps for the purpose of small businesses. Review to determine which app may be best suited for your business

> By using an expense app, the accountant obtains the digital copy of the receipt which should match to the relevant transaction in the bank statement lines within the accounting system
> and allow for faster reconciliations
