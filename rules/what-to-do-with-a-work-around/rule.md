If you have to use a workaround you should always comment your code and reference. You should also make a Suggestion to [Product] if you think it is something that the product should do.

1. Comment in the code with URL to an existing or new Suggestion
2. Create a Suggestion to .NET 3 that points to blog post

### Exercise: Understand commenting


You have just added a grid that auto updates, but you need to disable all the timers when you click the edit button. You have found an article on Code Project (http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/39194/Disable-a-timer-at-every-level-of-your-ASP-NET-con.aspx) and you have added the work around.

Now what do you do?



```
protected override void OnPreLoad(EventArgs e)
{
     //Fix for pages that allow edit in grids
     this.Controls.ForEach(c=>
     {   
          if (c is System.Web.UI.Timer)
          {
              c.Enabled = false;
          }
     });
     base.OnPreLoad(e);
}
```
