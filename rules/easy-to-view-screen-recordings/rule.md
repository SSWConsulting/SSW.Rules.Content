Most developers like to set up their screen efficiently – often that means small fonts, visible bookmark bars and a huge amount of browser tabs and taskbar items. While this is great for efficiency, it is not very good for recordings or presentations, and the clutter should be removed.

<!--endintro-->

Before recording your screen reduce visual noise by:

1. ✅**Removing unnecessary tabs** - Open the tab in its own window
2. ✅**Avoiding small fonts** - Zoom in to 125% by holding Ctrl and scrolling up on the mouse wheel
3. ✅**Hiding the bookmark bar** 

   * Windows shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + b
   * Mac shortcut: Cmd + Shift + b
