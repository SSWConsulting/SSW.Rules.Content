<span class='intro'> <p>When visitors are navigating through your site and they need 
     to make a selection from a control with fixed values, it is 
     best to have the control automatically post back. This makes 
     navigating your site quicker as the user does not have to 
     click other buttons to see the changes which they have made. 
     It is also important to remember that controls which do not 
     have set values, such as text boxes, should have a &quot;Show&quot; 
     button available to click once the visitor is finished 
     entering their data.
                </p> </span>
