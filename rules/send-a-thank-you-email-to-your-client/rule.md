When you are about to finish a client project, it is a good idea to prepare a "thank you" email, have it checked and send it to your customer (usually product owner) on the last day. In this email include:

<!--endintro-->



1. Thank your product owner for the time and tell him the reason why you really enjoy your time on this project
2. Check to make sure you have completed all requirements
3. Prepare a list of future improvements you can think of that can be done





There are a number of reasons why this is important:

* It shows that you really care about your client/project
* Give them something to think about. they might get you back to fix the problems you have identified.
* Show him that you will be supporting him after the project ends (not disappearing forever)


Below is a template email you can use:

Hi &lt;ClientName&gt;,Â 

Thank you very much for your time for the last xxx weeks. I think you must be the best product owner I have worked with at SSW (always available for me when needed). I really enjoyed this little project.

I hope I have completed most (if not all) of your most important requirements. I had good look at the source code and while it's fresh in my mind, I thought I might send you the following suggestions that would make it easier for myself and other developers in future:

Improvement Area 1:
1. Do this: because of this
2. Do this: because of this
