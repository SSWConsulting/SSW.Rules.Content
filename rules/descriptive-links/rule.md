The way your inbound links are worded makes a big difference. They play an important factor for search engine results and for the users.

Having descriptive links with relevant words **improves your website SEO** and gives a **more friendly experience to users**.

<!--endintro-->

For example, if a website had millions of inbound links that described it as "Movies for Free", when someone searches for "free movies" on Google, it would point to this website.

So what does this mean? All those links that are pointing to pages on your website displayed as 'More', 'Link', 'This' or 'Click Here' aren't doing you any favors when it comes to increasing your Google rankings.

Also, if you make your the link the entire URL, it won't be very readable to users. You should replace it with a descriptive sentence using relevant words.

You can also use links to give people a chance to investigate further on a topic. In which case, give the hyperlink enough and consistent info so they know what exactly they're clicking on.
