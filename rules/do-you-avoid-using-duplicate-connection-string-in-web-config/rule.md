Since we have many ways to use Connection String in .NET 2.0, it is probably that we are using duplicate connection string in web.config.   
<!--endintro-->


```
<connectionStrings>
   <add name="ConnectionString" connectionString="Server=(local);
Database=NorthWind;" />
</connectionStrings>
<appSettings>
   <add key="ConnectionString" value="Server=(local);Database=NorthWind;"/>
</appSettings>
```

          Bad example - use duplicate connection string in web.config.
