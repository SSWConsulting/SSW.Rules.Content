**#Hashtags** are used when talking about something – a topic or keyword. Using a hashtag creates a link that leads to a page displaying an aggregated list of posts about that thing.

So if it is about the topic, then the hashtag is the way to go:

> Microsoft releases **#VisualStudio** 2013 Update 2

On the other hand, **@Mentions** are used when talking to or about someone (the user account of a person, brand, group, etc.). The link created by a mention goes to that user account. The user is notified when they have received a mention in a post so that they can respond.

So if you are talking to someone directly, or mention a specific user in your tweet, you should use the @mention:

> Thanks to **@visualstudio** for the map to Bill Gates’s house – I’m looting his safe right now!

The best tweets will use a combination of @mentions and #hashtags where appropriate to properly leverage the platform – that way readers can check out the people involved OR join the conversation about a topic.
