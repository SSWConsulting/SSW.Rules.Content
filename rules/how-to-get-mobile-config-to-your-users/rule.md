Getting configuration into the hands of mobile app users can be challenging, and you need to make it as seamless as possible. For web apps, this usually isn't a problem; for any given instance, you go to that instance's URL. But for mobile apps, they often don't even know which instance to connect to.

When all the users of your app will need a single shared configuration, that config can ship with your app. But when your app needs per-user, per-tenant, or per instance config, that can be tricky.

Check out the video above for the best way to magically provide your users with configuration. And for a write-up, check out [Automagic Tenant Config for Mobile Apps](https://goforgoldman.com/posts/automagic-mobile-config/).
