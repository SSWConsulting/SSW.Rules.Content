Tracking expenses can be a painful process of accumulating receipts and entering them into outdated systems… but there is a better way. 



Various apps help solve the above problem. Using a modern Accounting system such as Xero, some connected apps can be used in conjunction with the accounting system and they include:


* [Hubdoc](https://www.hubdoc.com/)
* [Expensify](https://www.expensify.com/)
* [Receipt Bank](https://www.receipt-bank.com/au/)


It may be difficult to determine which app would be best suited for your business so below is a comparison of some of the major features of each app.

 **Overall, Hubdoc is a clear winner.** Additional to the above, Hubdoc is allowed unlimited users when connected with Xero.



To improve on the function of these apps, it is recommended to set-up default receiving emails that users can either forward all invoices to that email or just take a photo with the app which is stored within the app.

We can also do the vis versa, so all invoices going to a hubdoc default email can be forwarded back to a company internal email for reference.

Expense apps are a timesaver, both for the day to day user, as well as the accountant receiving the expenses.

As a user, all you have to do is take a photo of the receipt from your mobile app and add a comment (all other data is pulled in via OCR “Smart-scan”), then all of these expenses get batched together and sent on a weekly basis to the accountant, who can then manage them in bulk. 
Best of all… for light users… it’s free! ![](2020-06-12_12-10-17.png)
