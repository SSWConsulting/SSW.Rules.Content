<span class='intro'> <p>The Initial Release Plan is a summary of the work required to complete the clients project and provides a ballpark estimate. The Initial Release Plan will contain the following elements&#58; </p> </span>

<ul>
<li>An architectural roadmap recommending technical solutions</li>
<li>Time allocated for further specification work to be included in each Release. At SSW we only create detailed specifications for 3 releases at a time</li>
<li>A breakdown of the required software application into its core components, likely to include the approximate number of main features (e.g. screens, reports or sitemap)</li>
<li>An integration plan</li>
<li>A deployment strategy</li>
<li>A 'future functionality' wish list - requiring the client to set the priorities for the project through defining what is in and out of scope</li>
<li>A detailed list of 'issues' associated with the existing system which impact future development and maintenance</li>
<li>Hardware and licensed software recommendations</li>
<li>A sample mock-up screen where the project is less than one month</li></ul>
<p><strong>Sample Initial Release Plan</strong> </p>
<ol>
<li>Release&#160;1 (1.5 man months) - Database schema design</li>
<li>Release&#160;2 (1.5 man months) - Development Module 1 Customers</li>
<li>Release&#160;3 (1.5 man months) - Development Module 2 Products</li>
<li>Release&#160;4 (1.5 man months) - Development Module 3 Orders</li>
<li>Release&#160;5 (1.5 man months) - Development Module 4 Suppliers</li>
<li>Release&#160;6 (1.5 man months) - Development Modules 5 Employees</li></ol>
<p>With the Initial Release Plan, the client can see whether SSW understands their business and the requirements for their software development project. The ballpark estimate allows them to decide whether the project is feasible for their budget and time-frame. </p>
