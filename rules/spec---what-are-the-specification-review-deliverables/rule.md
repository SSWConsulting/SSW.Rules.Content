<span class='intro'> Usually, a specification process is done with the client before beginning work on a project, just like you would never build a house without getting an architect to create a plan.<br>&#160;<br>As you might appreciate, it is not realistic to understand the complexity of your system and give you a realistic estimate after a brief meeting. Our experience tells us we will need to spend a few days to obtain and document the requirements from your project’s stakeholders. This will help you turn your ideas into a more detailed roadmap.&#160;<br> </span>
