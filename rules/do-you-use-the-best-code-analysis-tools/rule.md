<span class='intro'> <p>Whenever you are writing code, you should always make sure it conforms to&#160;your team's&#160;standards.&#160;The more pain a developer has when trying to check in&#160;the better, because&#160;there will be less left up to testers to find.<br></p><p>No matter how good a coder you are, you will always miss some of them some of the time, so it's a really good idea to have a tool that automatically scans your code and reports on what you need to change in order to improve it.</p>
<p>Visual Studio has a great Code Analysis tool to help you look for problems in your code. Combine this with Jetbrain's ReSharper and your code will be smell free.</p><p>The levels of protection are&#58;</p> </span>
