Generally you will add Javascript to the form to give client side validation.

<!--endintro-->

Given JavaScript is difficult to debug and doesn't get precompiled this can save           a lot of time rather than re-publishing all the form changes and having to reload           and refresh the forms manually.
           These events can be trigged using the Preview menu from the form customization environment.
<dl class="image">          &lt;dt&gt;
            <img alt="Test your Javascript via the Preview menu in the Custom Forms Designer" src="CRM_TestForm.jpg">&lt;/dt&gt;
          <dd>

        </dl>
