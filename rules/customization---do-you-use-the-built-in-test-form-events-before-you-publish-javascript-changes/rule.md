<span class='intro'> <p>
          Generally you will add Javascript to the form to give client side validation.
        </p> </span>

 <p>
          Given JavaScript is difficult to debug and doesn't get precompiled this can save
          a lot of time rather than re-publishing all the form changes and having to reload
          and refresh the forms manually.<br>
          These events can be trigged using the Preview menu from the form customization environment.
