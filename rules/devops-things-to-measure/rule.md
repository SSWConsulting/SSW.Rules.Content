Before you begin your journey into DevOps, you should assess yourself and see where your project is at and where you can improve.

<!--endintro-->

For any software team, understanding your current DevOps maturity is essential to delivering high-quality products faster and more reliably. By measuring the right areas, teams can pinpoint strengths, uncover gaps, and create a clear roadmap for improvement.

This comprehensive DevOps evaluation covers these critical domains:

### 1. Team Onboarding & Collaboration

Efficient onboarding and seamless collaboration set the foundation for high-performing teams. Key aspects to track include onboarding time for new members, quality of documentation, communication tools in use, team size, meeting cadence, and the presence of cross-functional skills.

### 2. Deployments

Deployment practices are a strong indicator of delivery capability. Teams should monitor their most recent deployment date, deployment frequency, downtime during releases, incident resolution times, the number of environments, and overall deployment cycle time.

### 3. Coding Practices

High-quality code starts with disciplined development habits. This includes the use of source control, effective branching strategies, peer code reviews, well-defined pull-request workflows, and regular updates of dependencies.

### 4. Development Process

A clear and consistent process helps teams deliver predictably. Evaluate the development methodology in useâ€”whether Agile, Scrum, Kanban, or hybridâ€”and how well the team identifies and manages technical debt.

### 5. Automation

Automation reduces manual effort and minimizes errors. Track automation in infrastructure provisioning, build pipelines, deployment workflows, and UI testing to ensure repeatable, scalable delivery.

### 6. Telemetry

Continuous monitoring is essential for proactive improvement. Measure how effectively your team tracks errors, monitors performance, and analyzes usage to inform both technical and business decisions.
