<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​Often, when a manager is called in to help out with a conflict situation, they don’t have all the context or details, so backchannels can help to fill the gap.​<br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p> 
   <b>Prior backchannels</b> - Have an &quot;off the record&quot; conversation with your manager or teammate before a client meeting. If your manager has no idea about an issue, when they’re put on the&#160;spot in a meeting, they then have to interrogate regarding processes followed, etc. It’s better to have them prepared before they go in.&#160;One way to do this is by asking good questions – see the video on how to ask good questions below.​<br></p><p> 
   <b>Live&#160;backchannels </b>-&#160;Assist in real-time with relevant information in an alternative private channel e.g. SMS or Teams. This can help the conversation flow and help to verify what is being said, and limits the need for phrases such as, “William, is that true?”</p><p> 
   <b>Post&#160;backchannels&#160;</b>– Debrief your manager or teammate how the call or situation was handled, outcomes, where it is at now, next steps, etc.<br><br>In general, use Teams for private information, or SMS&#160;as a last resort. Treat sensitive information or scenarios with care to ensure a good outcome for all parties.​<br><br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox"> 
   <b>Client&#58;</b> &quot;I told them we’d need blah&quot;<br><b>Manager&#58;</b> &quot;Oh that does sound reasonable.

   <b>Dev&#58;</b> &quot;Heads up, they might be sensitive about this part as they have been very clear with us about it from the start and I missed it.
