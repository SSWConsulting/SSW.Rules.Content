Getting application architecture right is super hard and often choosing the wrong architecture at the start of a project causes immense pain further down the line when the limitations start to become apparent.

Azure has 100s of offerings and it can be hard to know what the right services are to choose for any given application.

However, there are a few questions you can ask yourself to help narrow down the right services for each business case.

There are 2 overarching questions to ask when building out Azure architecture:

# 1. How do you run your app?
There are heaps of models on offer in Azure for running your app. So, to choose the right one you need to break this question down into 3 further parts:

## 1.1 How much control do I need?
* Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
   * Infrastructure provided but 
* Platform as a Service (PaaS)
* Logic as a Service (LaaS)
* Software as a Service (SaaS)

## 1.2 Where do I need the app to run?
* Azure 
* On-Premises
* Other Clouds e.g. AWS, Netlify, GitHub Pages
* Hybrid

## 1.3 How often does the app need to run?

* Occasionally
   * Serverless (Pay per execution)
* All the time
   * Classic (Pay per month)

## 1.4 Examples

### Scenario #1 


### Scenario #2

# 2. How do you store your data?
