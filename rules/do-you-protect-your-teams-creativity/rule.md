### Structuring Work to Encourage Creativity
Good time management and clear focus help teams come up with better ideas and solutions.

❌ Avoid these mistakes:

- Setting unrealistic deadlines
- Expecting your team to multitask excessively
- Allowing constant interruptions and fragmented tasks
- Organizing group calls with large number of participants


These mistakes:

- Cause fragmented days and mental overload
- Decrease creativity and produce weak solutions
- Cause frustration and burnout
- Lower productivity even after deadlines pass i.e. "pressure handover"

✅ Good ways to manage:

- Prefer collaborating one-on-one rather than in groups
- Reserve some time for learning, experimentation, and exploring new ideas. Use strategies like "innovation time" (e.g., [3M’s 15% rule](https://www.3m.co.uk/3M/en_GB/careers/culture/15-percent-culture/))
- Schedule uninterrupted work periods
- Set regular times when your team can work without distractions like meetings or messages. It helps the team dive deeper into their tasks and boosts creative problem-solving.
