It is important to regularly do a &quot;Get Latest&quot; to make sure you are using the most recent version of the code. In a team, if you go too long without doing a Get, you are more likely to encounter inconsistencies and will have to spend time merging your code.
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>As part of your team process, you should make sure all developers are doing a Get Latest on a regular basis for each project they are working on.&#160; This is in line with our <a href="/TFS/RulesToBetterVersionControlwithTFS(AKASourceControl)/Pages/TestDrivenProcess.aspx">Do you Follow a Test Drive Process</a> rule.</p>
<p class="ssw-rteStyle-Tip">Tip&#58; To find out when you or another developer last did a Get from TFS, you can use the Workspace Sidekick in <a href="http&#58;//www.attrice.info/cm/tfs/index.htm"><font color="#3a66cc">Team Foundation Sidekicks</font></a>. If you're the TFS Master, you should do this every couple of weeks to make sure your team is regularly retrieving files from TFS.</p>
