  <p>There are two reasons that a story can be removed from the sprint. 
</p>

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <ol>
    <li>Your team notices that they can’t get everything done, and agree with&#160;the product owner to remove the story. </li>
    <li>At the Sprint Review meeting the Product Owner rejects the story </li>
</ol>
<p>In both these cases the Story moves back to the backlog and&#160;any unfinished tasks left in the sprint are closed. The PO may decide to prioritise the story high enough to make the next Sprint, but he may not.</p>
