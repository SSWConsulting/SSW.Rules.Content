It's important to provide a physical space for each employee to store their stuff and as a bonus they can also receive packages and mail. Lockers should:

<!--endintro-->

* Be clearly labelled with the staff members name
* Ideally, should have a slot for mail
* Ideally should be half-height so you can hang a shirt or a jacket
* Encourage the goal of a clean desk policy
* Encourage the chucking of paper - it should not be a place to keep all of your scraps of papers. Paper tends to get lost and should be transferred to tasks as 'To Myself' emails and then chuck. See[Rules to better Email](/rules-to-better-email) for more information.

Figure: Bad example - Having a drawer and a mailbox takes too much space (2 different locations) and larger packages won't fit

::: good
Figure: OK example - Stepped lockers are great as they allow jackets (however missing the mail hole)

Note: At Microsoft Canberra and other offices, they call this "Keep your office in your bag". See the [5S methodology](/do-you-use-the-5s-desk-space-organization-system-invented-by-the-japanese) Rule for more details.
