When using two-way binding in Blazor with `@bind-Value`, you might want to execute code when the bound value changes. A common mistake is trying to use both `@bind-Value` and `ValueChanged` together, but this causes a compile error because `ValueChanged` is generated by the `@bind-Value` directive.

The correct approach is to use `@bind-Value:after` which triggers a callback after the value changes.

## ❌ Bad Example - Using ValueChanged with @bind-Value

```razor
<RadzenRadioButtonList TValue="bool?" 
    @bind-Value="Question.Answer.BoolValue" 
    ValueChanged="@(() => SaveQuestion())" />
```

::: bad
Figure: Bad example - This gives a compile error: "The component parameter 'ValueChanged' is used two or more times for this component ... The component parameter 'ValueChanged' is generated by the '@bind-Value' directive attribute
:::

## ✅ Good Example - Using @bind-Value:after

```razor
<RadzenRadioButtonList TValue="bool?" 
    @bind-Value="Question.Answer.BoolValue" 
    @bind-Value:after="@(() => SaveQuestion())" />
```

::: good
Figure: Good example - Using @bind-Value:after gives you two-way binding and control over what code is called when the value changes

## How @bind-Value:after works

The `@bind-Value:after` directive:

* Executes **after** the bound value is assigned synchronously
* Supports both synchronous and asynchronous delegates
* Works with any component that supports two-way binding
* Can be used with different binding events (e.g., `@bind-Value:event="oninput"`)

## Advanced Example

```razor
<input @bind="searchText" 
       @bind:event="oninput" 
       @bind:after="PerformSearch" />

@code {
    private string? searchText;
    private string[]? searchResult;

    private async Task PerformSearch() => 
        searchResult = await SearchService.FetchAsync(searchText);
}
```
