When guests come to an SSW Office, we provide them with easy Wifi access using a QR code. This saves people manually typing in a password and can have them up and running in a matter of moments.
QR codes can easily be created with services like [QR Code Monkey](https://www.qrcode-monkey.com/#wifi).
