When emailing external parties, it is a good idea to CC the other colleagues within your organization that may have an interest in the email. Some of the benefits of CC'ing others are:

* It can save time
* Gives the email more credibility if you have CC'd others in your organization
* Colleagues may correct your mistakes

::: info
**Note:** Don't cc people unnecessarily - it is another email problem!
:::

Some people might reply only to the sender of the email ('[little r](https://www.netlingo.com/word/little-r.php)'), ignoring the fact that there were other persons included in the original email. Obviously the original sender intended to keep everyone in the loop, so it would be polite to CC everyone included on the original communication ('Reply All').

## Exceptions

* If the sender requests a 'little r' reply
* If not all recipients need to be informed
* If the [opinions of some recipients do not matter](/email-add-or-remove-someone-from-conversation) as they are unlikely to disagree
* If the original email was to an alias with many subscribers, in general you should not Reply All

## What if the other person drops relevant people?

Sometimes the other person will 'little r' instead of 'Reply All' by mistake. This can be problematic as those dropped off the loop are needed as part of the decision making.

If you are still on the loop, you should reply to the thread as soon as possible, adding back all those dropped from the loop.
