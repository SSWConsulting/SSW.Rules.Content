This idea is different from the other rules in this category in that it strikes at the heart of our everyday behaviour, not just when a crisis is looming. [Jesus of Nazareth](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matt%205:41&version=NKJV%3b) said:

"And whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two."

While not everyone chooses to agree with everything He said, it's a valid point when it comes to creating a positive team environment. If you're willing to be proactive and help others above and beyond the call of duty, a whole ream of benefits flow:

<!--endintro-->

- People begin to share responsibility for work that traditionally is claimed as _"not my problem"_
- Others will return the favour when you really need it
- The sense of workplace isolation disappears
- Productivity lifts as tasks can be achieved more quickly

This rule particularly applies when a person is [blocked](/ask-for-help) â€“ as identified in their Daily Scrum.
