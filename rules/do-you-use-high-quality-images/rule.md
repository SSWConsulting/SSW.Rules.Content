<span class='intro'> 
  <p>Use high resolution images in your presentations. Never stretch small, low-resolution photos to make it fit. This degrades the resolution even further and the image will appear very coarse and granular on the projection screen.</p>

<p>The quality of your images is a subconscious message to your audience. If you use low quality pictures, then you unintentionally suggest the same message about your product.</p>

<p>For this reason, we encourage you to choose only high quality photos and to avoid cartoons and word art.</p> </span>
