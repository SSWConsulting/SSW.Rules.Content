<span class='intro'> 
  <p>Never stretch small, low-resolution photos to make it fill up the space. This degrades the resolution and the image will appear very coarse and granular on the projection screen.</p>
<p>The quality of your images is a subconscious message to your audience. If you use low quality pictures, then you unintentionally suggest the same message about your product.</p>
<p>For this reason, we encourage you to choose only high quality photos and to avoid cartoons and word art.</p>
