<span class='intro'> ​You need to log a record on success so you can check for backups that have failed. <br> </span>

<dl class="badImage"><dt><img src="backup_notification_bad.jpg" alt="backup_notification_bad.jpg" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Bad example - an email is sent on completion</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt><img src="backup_notification_good.jpg" alt="backup_notification_good.jpg" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good example - a record is logged on completion</dd></dl><p>​​​Now you are able to be aware of missing backups. You can make automatically notification based on above table e.g.&#160;<a href="https&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/KB/KB.aspx?KBID=Q1455840">by SQL Reporting Services data-driven subscription</a></p>
