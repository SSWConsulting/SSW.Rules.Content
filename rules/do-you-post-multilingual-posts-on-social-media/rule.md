<div>​​​If you have an office in more than one country, a great way to show your diversity and connect with your different audiences is&#160;through posting&#160;multilingual social media​.​​&#160;<br></div><div><br></div><div>Building and maintaining a multilingual social media presence is not an easy undertaking, but ​when done properly it is well worth the time and effort. It allows you to truly connect with your audience regardless of which language they speak. International customers will appreciate the fact that your brand has taken time to communicate with them in their native tongue, it will also&#160;help establish their&#160;trust in your ability to understand them,&#160;and shows that&#160;you don't have to rely on dodgy automatic translations that often&#160;go wrong.&#160;​<br>&#160;<br></div>

<p>​For example, at SSW, we have an awesome office in Hangzhou, China,&#160;that offers a&#160;<a href="https&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Chinafy-App.aspx">Chinafy Consulting Service</a>&#160;to help&#160;Western companies adapt to the Chinese business environment. It is important for us to show that we understand our customers, and their target audience​ -&#160;our social media reflects our ability to do this.<br></p><div class="ms-rtestate-read ms-rte-wpbox"><div class="ms-rtestate-notify  ms-rtestate-read 8fb64ff3-208f-465e-9391-9b9aac4680f3" id="div_8fb64ff3-208f-465e-9391-9b9aac4680f3" unselectable="on"></div><div id="vid_8fb64ff3-208f-465e-9391-9b9aac4680f3" unselectable="on" style="display&#58;none;"></div></div><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">​​​​​Goo​​d example&#58;&#160;SSW China&#160;post their social media in&#160;both English and&#160;Chinese ​中文, because&#160;it helps&#160;establish&#160;trust with our audience that we understand them,&#160;helps us target a wider audience, and proves that&#160;we can help bridge&#160;the language&#160;barrier.&#160;​<br><br></dd><br>
