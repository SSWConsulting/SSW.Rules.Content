Often pages have 2 or 3 links pointing to the same page - all fairly close to each other, like in one or two paragraphs. It is a good idea to never have multiple links to the **exact** same page for the following reasons:

* Every link distracts the user from reading the main text content
* They confuse the user as they have to decide which link to click first (and then end up to the same place anyway)
* They are annoying when the user is trying to be thorough and read the related content and they are repeatedly directed to the same page
