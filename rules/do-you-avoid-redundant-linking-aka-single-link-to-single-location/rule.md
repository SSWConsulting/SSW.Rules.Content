<span class='intro'> <p>
                    Often pages have 2 or 3 links pointing to the same page - 
     all fairly close to each other, like in one or two 
     paragraphs. It is a good idea to never have multiple links 
     to the *exact* same page for the following reasons&#58;
                </p><ul><li>Every link distracts the user from reading the main text 
     content</li><li>They confuse the user as they have to decide which link 
     to click first (and then end up to the same place anyway)</li><li>They are annoying when the user is trying to be thorough 
     and read the related content and they are repeatedly 
     directed to the same page</li></ul> </span>
