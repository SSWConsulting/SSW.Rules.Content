Often pages have 2 or 3 links pointing to the same page -       all fairly close to each other, like in one or two       paragraphs. It is a good idea to never have multiple links       to the \*exact\* same page for the following reasons:

* Every link distracts the user from reading the main text 
     content
* They confuse the user as they have to decide which link 
     to click first (and then end up to the same place anyway)
* They are annoying when the user is trying to be thorough 
     and read the related content and they are repeatedly 
     directed to the same page
