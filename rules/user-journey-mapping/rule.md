User or customer journey mapping is an important tool that allows the capture and communication of user needs in a helpful and visual way.
            
<!--endintro-->

These artifacts should be used at the beginning of a project during the early stages of research and design. This allows user requirements to properly inform design decisions made during development, and can help teams build a strong common understanding of a project. Capturing feedback in a journey map during or even after development can provide high value - pain points discovered in this way can reveal opportunities for immediate improvement. 

Helpful tools for user journey mapping include: 
- FigJam 
- Miro 
- A whiteboard and a stack of sticky notes.
