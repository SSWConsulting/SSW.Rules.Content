User or customer journey mapping is an important tool that allows the capture and communication of user needs in a helpful and visual way.
            
<!--endintro-->

These artifacts should be used at the beginning of a project during the early stages of research and design. This allows user requirements to properly inform design decisions made during development, and can help teams build a strong common understanding of a project. Capturing feedback in a journey map during or even after development can provide high value as well. Pain points discovered in this way can reveal opportunities or areas for immediate improvement. 

Helpful tools for user journey mapping include:

- [Miro](https://miro.com/index/) 
- A whiteboard and a stack of sticky notes.
