Understanding basic video terminology allows for better communication in video creation. Using basic video terminology can make our video content more engaging. It's important and useful for anyone involved in video production to know the basic terminology.

## Filming Terminologies

### Primary footage (AKA main video)

Primary footage is the footage that "tells" the story. It's the main audio and video that often consists of one or more people discussing a topic or narrative. Primary footage is the predominant format for most documentaries, broadcasts, talk shows, or TV shows.

For example, on the SSW TV YouTube channel, this video mainly consists of the primary footage.

**Video example: The [interview footage](https://youtu.be/mQyzt4CV_Jw?t=38) drives the story of the video**

Primary footage can be greatly enhanced by using additional footage known as B-roll.

### B-roll footage

B-roll is used to visually support the primary video in telling the story. For example, if the primary footage talks about the office, the B-roll might be the employees, the team meeting etc.

For example, when the main video/primary footage comes to “our developers are working really hard”, the B-roll footage is the developer at work.

**Video example: [B-roll](https://youtu.be/BioFgITYAFY?t=63) of 2 developers discussing**

## Editing Terminologies

### Overlay



Overlay clips are used to enhance the visual story and add detail to what is being described on screen.


For example, when you talk about a meal and cutting to a clip of that delicious meal.


### Cutaway

The cutaway shot is a filmmaking and editing technique. It is a supplementary shot that “cuts away” from the main action.

For example, when watching a car chase in a film, and during the scene of the racing cars, we "cutaway" to someone having coffee at a roadside cafe, and the cars fly past. Then we resume the cars chase sequence.

### Sequence


A Sequence is a series of clips that are edited in a linear or non-linear order to deliver a story or message.

**Video example: [Sequence clips](https://youtu.be/g4_MnAZJpxg?t=318) often to used to give context to a scene**

### Montage

Montage is piecing together separate sections of a video to form a new idea or meaning. This helps reveal the connections between things and show the nature of what's happening over time.

For example, montage clips can be used in the intro of a video, both to highlight the content of the video and make it visually appealing.

**Video example: The [intro](https://youtu.be/Em_kgd3R_gw) of the NDC video uses montage**
