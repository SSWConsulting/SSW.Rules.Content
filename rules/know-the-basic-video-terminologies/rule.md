Understanding basic video terminology allows for better communication in video creation. Using basic video terminology can make video content more engaging. It's important and useful for anyone involved in video production to know the basic terminology.

## Filming Terminologies

### 1. Primary footage (aka. main video)

Primary footage is the footage that "tells" the story. It's the main audio and video that often consists of one or more people discussing a topic or narrative. Primary footage is the predominant format for most documentaries, broadcasts, talk shows, or TV shows.

For example, the interview here is the “primary footage” which drives the story.

**Video: Primary Footage - Talking Head - [0:38 - 3:05](https://youtu.be/mQyzt4CV_Jw?t=38)**

Primary footage can be greatly enhanced by using additional footage known as B-Roll.

### 2. B-Roll footage

B-Roll or B roll is any supplemental video that considered to be secondary to your primary footage. It is used to visually support the primary video in telling the story. 

For example, the video here use B-Roll footage - developer at work, to supplement the primary footage audio "our developers are working really hard".

**Video: B-Roll - Developer at work - [1:01 - 1:04](https://youtu.be/BioFgITYAFY?t=63)**

B-Roll and overlay are common terminologies for footage that is placed over the top of other footage to help break up the video for the viewer.

## Video Editing Terminologies

### 3. Overlay

An overlay is technically any visual effect (or even a LUT) that alters the appearance of footage without actually changing the footage itself. 

For example, when you talk about a meal and cutting to a clip of that delicious meal.

### 4. Cutaway

The cutaway shot is a filmmaking and video editing technique. It is a supplementary shot that “cuts away” from the main action.

For example, when watching a car chase in a film, and during the scene of the racing cars, we "cutaway" to someone having coffee at a roadside cafe, and the cars fly past. Then we resume the cars chase sequence.

### 5. Sequence

A Sequence is a series of clips that are edited in a linear or non-linear order to deliver a story or message.

**Video: Sequence - give context a scene - [5:18 - 5:23](https://youtu.be/g4_MnAZJpxg?t=318)**

### 6. Montage

Montage is piecing together separate sections of a video to form a new idea or meaning. This helps reveal the connections between things and show the nature of what's happening over time.

For example, montage clips can be used in the intro of a video, both to highlight the content of the video and make it visually appealing.

`youtube: https://www.youtube.com/embed/Em_kgd3R_gw`

**Video: Montage - Video intro - [0:00 - 0:14](https://youtu.be/Em_kgd3R_gw)**

### 7. Title Sequence (aka. Opening Sequence, Intro)

A title sequence (also called an opening sequence or intro) is the method by which films or television programmes present their title and key production and cast members, utilizing conceptual visuals and sound (often a opening theme song with visuals, akin to a brief music video).

### 8. Outro

As the word suggests, intros are visuals that mark the beginning of a video. Likewise, outros are the closing visuals that appear at the end. 

`youtube: https://www.youtube.com/embed/k7bQ320vOj0?t=202`

**Video: Outro - [3:22 - 3:44](https://youtu.be/k7bQ320vOj0?t=202)**

### 9. Lower Third

A lower third is a combination of text and graphical elements placed in the lower area of the screen to give the audience more information.

For example, the lower third here point out the key words of the video.

`youtube: https://www.youtube.com/embed/https://youtu.be/2Ff6NQrWMsY?t=1`

**Video: Lower third - show the key words - [0:01 - 0:10](https://youtu.be/2Ff6NQrWMsY?t=1)**

### 10. PIP (Picture-In-Picture)

(PIP) video effects allow you to overlay one video onto another, displaying both videos simultaneously.

For example, the interview here is use PIP effect.

`youtube: https://www.youtube.com/embed/https://youtu.be/uUI6pllk6TA?t=22`

**Video: PIP - [0:22 - 1:34](https://youtu.be/uUI6pllk6TA?t=22)**

### 11. Video scrubbing

Moving the cursor or playhead across the video timeline manually is called video scrubbing. On a video editor, video scrubbing can be done by moving the cursor forwards or backward through the timeline or moving the scrubber at the bottom of the timeline.
