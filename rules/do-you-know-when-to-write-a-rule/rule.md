The purpose of a rule is to effectively establish and record a process to guide employees in their day to day activities.

<!--endintro-->

Rules facilitate:

* Consistency
* Coherent instruction
* A high standard of documentation
* Better understanding of processes
* Efficiency improvements


Only write a rule after the situation has happened more than once – chances are it will happen again and a rule/standard should be created.
