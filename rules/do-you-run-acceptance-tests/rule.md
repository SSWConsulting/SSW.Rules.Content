<span class='intro'> <p>Once the coding doing is done by the developers, the&#160;functionality must&#160;then be stepped through in the&#160;required browsers.&#160;You can do this manually or&#160;step it up&#160;by using a great tool like Microsoft Test Manager.</p>
<p>This is how you run Acceptance Tests&#58;</p> </span>

<p><img alt="run acceptance tests" src="/SoftwareDevelopment/RulesToBetterUserAcceptanceTests/PublishingImages/run-acceptance-tests-1.jpg" />&#160;<br><strong>Figure&#58; Run each 'test case' with a prescribed configuration</strong></p>
<p>&#160;<img alt="run acceptance tests" src="/SoftwareDevelopment/RulesToBetterUserAcceptanceTests/PublishingImages/run-acceptance-tests-2.jpg" /> <br><strong>Figure&#58; As you progress through each step, 'Pass' or 'Fail' the expected results. Take screen captures or video&#160;as appropriate.</strong></p>
<p>&#160;<img alt="run acceptance tests" src="/SoftwareDevelopment/RulesToBetterUserAcceptanceTests/PublishingImages/run-acceptance-tests-3.jpg" /> <br><strong>Figure&#58; Bad Example -After checking all the ‘Expected’ results in your MTM test, do not forget to Pass or Fail the Test Case </strong></p>

<p><strong>Figure&#58; Good example - After all 'Test Steps' have been checked off, choose the overall status for the test. Otherwise it will continue to show as 'Active' on the reports.</strong></p>
<p>&#160;<img alt="run acceptance tests" src="/SoftwareDevelopment/RulesToBetterUserAcceptanceTests/PublishingImages/run-acceptance-tests-5.jpg" /> <br><strong>Figure&#58; Bad Example – No Tests should remain as 'Active' or 'Failed' at the end of a Sprint</strong> </p>
<p><img alt="run acceptance tests" src="/SoftwareDevelopment/RulesToBetterUserAcceptanceTests/PublishingImages/run-acceptance-tests-6.jpg" />&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Figure&#58; Good Example – every test is 'Passed'. <br></strong>Tip&#58; You can pass a test from the test list. Select the Test menu, then the Test Suite. Choose the Test Case to pass and then click the green button ‘Pass Test’</p>
