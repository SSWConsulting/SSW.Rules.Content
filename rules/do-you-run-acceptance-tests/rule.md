Once the coding is done by the developers, the functionality must then be stepped through in the required browsers. You can do this manually or automating it using a great tool like Microsoft Test Manager.

The 1st step in getting automated tests, is to setup Acceptance Tests:

**Tip:** You can pass a test from the test list. Select the Test menu, then the Test Suite. Choose the Test Case to pass and then click the green button ‘Pass Test’.
