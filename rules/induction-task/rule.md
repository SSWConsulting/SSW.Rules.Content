## Heading of the test rule - Jimmy

When I create SSW Rules I need to choose the right format to use 

They are including:

<!--StartFragment-->

1. This is the first format used
2. This is the second format used
3. This is the third format used

<!--EndFragment-->

Examples and markdown cheatsheet can be found at [Example Rule + Markdown Cheatsheet](https://ssw.com.au/rules/rule#unordered-list). This is an example rule to show you what is possible for a rule. You will see everything you need to create an awesome page.

<!--endintro-->

## The good example of rule

Good rules should consider to include following:

<!--StartFragment-->

* This is the first item of an unordered list
* This is the second item of an unordered list
* This is the third item of an unordered list

  * This is the first item of an unordered list inside another
  * This is the second item of an unordered list inside anothe

<!--EndFragment-->
