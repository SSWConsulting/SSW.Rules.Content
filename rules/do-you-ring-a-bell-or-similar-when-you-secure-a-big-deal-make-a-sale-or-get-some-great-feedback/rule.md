<span class='intro'> 
  <p>A great way of motivating your staff is to have some form of recognition in place; happy employees are good employees! One of the simplest ways to achieve this is by having a bell located within the office for employees to ring when they have made a large sale, secured a big deal or some important news to announce. By showing appreciation to your employees you encourage all your staff to perform.<br></p>

<p>At SSW whenever a big new project is signed up, we sell an enterprise license for one of our products, or we release a project into production we send an email to all staff and then ring the bell, which is located in the middle of the office.</p>

<p>Similarly, when we get some feedback we will send around an email.<br></p><p>As a company owner or manager, you might want to see who of your employees&#160;are contributing to this feeling of appreciation around the office, and you can do that by querying your Exchange Server for threads with &quot;Ring the Bell&quot; in the subject<br></p>
