When a new programmer on your team needs to get up and running on the SharePoint image you know the right and wrong way to say it.


::: greybox
Sit with John Liu and he will get you up on our SharePoint image
:::

Bad Example: Explain how to run the SharePoint image

::: greybox
Get the URL to the standard from our intranet, if the standard is unclear, check your changes with John Liu and then make them
:::

Good Example: Refer to SharePoint rules
