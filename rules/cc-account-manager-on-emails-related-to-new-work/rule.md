Once a project gets underway, it is not uncommon for the development team to take over a lot of the project management workload. Since they are the people most in contact with the client, sometimes new work will be organized through them instead of the Account Manager.

When this is the case, the "As per our conversation" email should CC the Account Manager so he is always aware of all work being done, and can create a [new CRM opportunity](/data-entry-do-you-know-how-to-create-new-opportunities) if required.

**Note:** If an [initial meeting](/meetings-do-you-know-the-agenda-for-the-initial-meeting) is required for the new work, the Account Manager should be in attendance where possible to help continue the relationship.
