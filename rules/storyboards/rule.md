Storyboarding can quickly and easily capture user requirements. Crafting your UX storyboard does not require artistic skill, it only needs to show the sequence of events visually. 

Storyboards can provide more clarity than bulky design documents. They help developers and stakeholders understand what the UX and user scenarios will be, and are usually included in Spec Reviews. 

Storyboarding first became popular as a tool in motion picture production.

In the world of software development, using images makes the story quick to understand at first glance and easy to remember.

### Why does storyboarding matter in software development?

Many people use UML (Unified Modeling Language) to specify, construct, and document the various aspects of software systems. However, UML can be hard for clients to understand.

On the other hand, Storyboarding is an effective way to capture, convey, and explore different user experiences.
