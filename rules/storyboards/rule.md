Storyboarding can quickly and easily capture user requirements. Crafting your UX storyboard does not require artistic skill, it only needs to show the sequence of events visually. 

Storyboards can provide more clarity than bulky design documents. They help developers and stakeholders understand what the UX and user scenarios will be, and are usually included in Spec Reviews. 

Storyboarding first became popular as a tool in motion picture production.

In the world of software development, using images makes the story quick to understand at first glance and easy to remember.

### Why does storyboarding matter in software development?

Many people use UML (Unified Modeling Language) to specify, construct, and document the various aspects of software systems. However, UML can be hard for clients to understand.

On the other hand, Storyboarding is an effective way to capture, convey, and explore different user experiences.

### The 3 elements of a storyboard

There are 3 common storyboard elements: a User Story, visuals, and captions.

1. **User Story:** Storyboards are based on a specific scenario. The role that corresponds to that scenario must be clearly specified. A short text description of the scenario or story must be clear enough that a team member or stakeholder could understand what is depicted before looking at the visuals.

2. **Visuals:** The scenario is visually depicted in a sequential manner using sketches or photos. These images can range from quick, low-fidelity drawings to detailed, high-fidelity artifacts, depending on the purpose and intended audience of the storyboard. The visuals include relevant details such as the user’s environment or a sketch of the device being interacted with.

3. **Captions:** Each frame should include corresponding descriptions of the user’s actions, environment, device, and so on.

### How to create a storyboard

Creating a storyboard can feel like a daunting task. However, remember they are most valuable as a low-fidelity artifact and don’t need to take a long time to create.

Effective storyboarding follows 4 key high-level steps:

1. **Define the audience and purpose** 

It's important to have a clear goal before creating the storyboard. Understand the context in which your storyboard will be set. Identify the specific situation or scenario that your user will encounter, and define the characteristics and needs of the user persona involved.

2. **Aim for low-fidelity** 

You can use paper, a whiteboard, or digital tools depending on your preference. Understand the aim is to establish a shared understanding, rather than a polished artifact. Storyboard is meant to tell a story. Don’t spend too much time polishing the visuals unless you have to.

   Learn more on [Creating mockups and prototypes](/mockups-and-prototypes).

3. **Create visuals and add captions**

Begin sketching the visuals for each step of the storyboard. Use sketches to quickly depict a sequence or scene during brainstorming. Focus on capturing the essential elements that represent the users' actions and environment.

4. **Present storyboard**

Share your storyboard with the intended audience, which can be your internal team or project stakeholders, to effectively communicate your ideas and concepts.
