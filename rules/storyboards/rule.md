Storytelling plays a large role in software design and development. A story captures attention, provides clarity, and inspires teams and stakeholders to take action. 

Storyboards is a good way to visually communicate stories to teams and stakeholders.
A storyboard is composed of a linear sequence of graphics or illustrations combined to create a visual story.

Used as a tool, storyboards first became popular in motion picture production.

In the world of software development, storyboards is used to provide additional context to teams and stakeholders. Using images makes the story quick to understand at first glance and easy to remember.

### Why does storyboarding matter in software development?

Storyboarding is one of the cost-efficient ways to capture, convey, and explore different user experiences during the software design process.

### The 3 elements of a storyboard

There are 3 common storyboard elements: a User Story, visuals, and corresponding captions.

* **User Story:** Storyboards are based on a specific scenario. The role that corresponds to that scenario must be clearly specified. A short text description of the scenario or story must clear enough that a team member or stakeholder could understand what is depicted before looking at the visuals.

  **Learn more:** [Do you use User Stories format when appropriate?](/spec-do-you-use-user-stories/)
* **Visuals:** The scenario is visually depicted in a sequential manner using sketches or photos. These images can range from quick, low-fidelity drawings to detailed, high-fidelity artifacts, depending on the purpose and intended audience of the storyboard. The visuals include relevant details such as the user’s environment or a sketch of the device being interacted with.

* **Captions:** Each visual should include corresponding s to describes the user’s actions, environment, device, and so on.

### How to create a storyboard

Creating a storyboard can feel like a daunting task. However, remember they are most valuable as a low-fidelity artifact and don’t need to take a long time to create.

Effective storyboarding follows 5 key high-level steps:

**1. Define the purpose:** 

It's important to have a clear goal before creating the storyboard. A clearly-defined goal will help determine the scenario and user persona who should be involved in the storyboarding process. To make sure the storyboard aligns with its intended purpose and effectively communicates.

**2. Determine the fidelity level** 

You can use paper, a whiteboard, or digital tools depending on your preference. Understand the aim is to establish a shared understanding, rather than a polished artifact. Storyboard is meant to tell a story. Don’t spend too much time polishing the visuals unless you have to.

**3. Define the user persona and scenario**

Understand the context in which your storyboard will be set. Identify the specific situation or scenario that your user will encounter, and define the characteristics and needs of the user persona involved.

**4. Create visuals and add captions**

Begin sketching the visuals for each step of the storyboard. Use sketches to quickly depict a sequence or scene during brainstorming. Focus on capturing the essential elements that represent the actions, environment, and emotions of the user.

**5. Present storyboard**

Share your storyboard with the intended audience, which can be your internal team or project stakeholders, to effectively communicate your ideas and concepts.

### What are the best tools?

### Summary

Crafting your UX storyboard does not require high drawing skills design. The goal is to rely on the proper sequence of events presented visually. 

:::info
Storyboards help to create more clarity than bulky design documents.

They can:
* Take the focus off our internal bias and help us empathize with our users
* Help clients and stakeholders understand and remember specific user scenarios
* Help dev teams understand what drives user behavior
