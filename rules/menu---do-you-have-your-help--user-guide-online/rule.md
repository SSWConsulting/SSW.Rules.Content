<span class='intro'> <p>Users who are finding your application a little hard to use will always look for a user guide. The first thing they would do is to reach for the help menu. The &quot;About&quot; button can provide a link to the product website, but this is not very handy and obvious for a user who needs quick help. A link to the user guide must be in the &quot;Help&quot; menu.</p> </span>

â€‹<div>There are benefits of having your user guide online&#58;</div>
<ol><li>Easier to keep up-to-date and maintain</li>
<li>Stats on usage</li>
<li>Allows community commenting</li></ol>
