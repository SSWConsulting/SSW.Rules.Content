<span class='intro'> ​Maintaining a public profile on sites such as Facebook and LinkedIn is a free and easy way to connect with users and keep them updated&#160;your products, services or events. The downside to this is that not all who want to connect with you and your groups are real people – some are spammers or bots who will clog up your group, forum or event listing with unwanted advertisements or even links to sites that contain malicious code.<div><br></div><div>&#160;Before approving a membership request, consider&#58;</div> </span>

If you're experiencing ongoing problems with spammers,&#160;this might be a good option to use&#160;as it keeps your site friendly and professional, and gives you the final word on what content is shared with your members or followers.&#160;<br></p>
