<span class='intro'> ​​​Maintaining a public profile on sites such as Facebook and LinkedIn is a free and easy way to connect with users and keep them updated&#160;your products, services or events. The downside to this is that not all who want to connect with you and your groups are real people – some are spammers or bots who will clog up your group, forum or event listing with unwanted advertisements or even links to sites that contain malicious code.<div><br></div><div>​Before approving a membership request, consider&#58;</div> </span>

<div><ul><li>
         <span style="line-height&#58;1.5em;">How old is the account?</span><br></li><li>
         <span style="line-height&#58;1.5em;">Is the account profile properly filled out?&#160;</span><br></li><li>
         <span style="line-height&#58;1.5em;">Do the name and picture match the listed gender?&#160;</span><br></li><li>
         <span style="line-height&#58;1.5em;">Does the profile picture look “real” (as opposed to a picture of a model that the spammer has stolen from elsewhere)?</span><br></li><li>
         <span style="line-height&#58;1.5em;">Does the account show real status updates or are they gibberish?</span><br></li><li>
         <span style="line-height&#58;1.5em;">Are they a member of many incongruous groups that don’t fit with their location?&#160;</span><br></li></ul></div><div><b>Note&#58;</b>&#160;These are only&#160;guidelines, not a hard and fast rule. Use your initiative when approving membership requests.&#160;</div><div>
   <br>
</div><div>For groups on Facebook, there is now a tool that allows admin to ask up to 3 preset questions of all users wishing to join. This can be helpful in establishing in separating spammers from legitimate users.<br></div><div>​​<br></div><dl class="image"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/facebook%20screening%20questions.jpg" alt="" style="width&#58;800px;" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Asking a screening question is a good way to separate real people with a genuine interest from those who just want to spam the group<br></dd></dl><dl class="image"><dt>​<img src="/PublishingImages/suspicious-profile.png" alt="Example of a suspicious profile" style="width&#58;800px;" /></dt><dd> Figure&#58; an example of a suspicious profile</dd></dl>
<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Some sites will allow you moderate comments so that only approved posts are displayed. If you're experiencing ongoing problems with spammers,&#160;this might be a good option to use&#160;as it keeps your site friendly and professional and gives you the final word on what content is shared with your members or followers.&#160;<br></p>
