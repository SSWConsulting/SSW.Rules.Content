Getting difficult work done requires focus and there are many techniques to do that. This is why you should use the Pomodoro Technique.

<!--endintro-->

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that was developed in the late 1980s by Francesco Cirillo. It is used to break up your work into intervals. By using a timer, you separate work intervals with short breaks. Each interval is known as a **pomodoro.**

A 25-minute Pomodoro session is considered by most long enough to get a little work done but not so long that it feels painful or overwhelming. However, it is possible to [experiment with the length of your pomodoros](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique#experiment-with-the-length-of-your-pomodoros).

**The traditional technique uses 6 steps:**

1. Decide on the task to be done.
2. Set the pomodoro timer (Typically 25 minutes)
3. Work on the task.
4. End work when the timer rings and take a short break (Typically 5-10 minutes).
5. If you have fewer than three pomodoros, go back to Step 2 and repeat until you go through all three pomodoros.
6. After three pomodoros are done, take the fourth pomodoro and then take a long break (traditionally 20 to 30 minutes). Once the long break is finished, return to Step 2.

A great application that encourages the use of the Pomodoro Technique is **Forest**.
