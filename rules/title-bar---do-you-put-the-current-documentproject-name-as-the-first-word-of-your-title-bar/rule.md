<span class='intro'> <p>Too many developers never change the Title Bar. The Title Bar should reflect the current document in the same way that Microsoft Word, Notepad, etc do.</p> </span>

â€‹<div>Imagine if every email that Microsoft Outlook opened didn't change the title bar. When you were to open a few emails and then take a look in the Taskbar, they would all look the same.</div>
<div>Therefore change the Title Bar to have the current document/customer/job/project/product name that the user is working on. It should be in the format &quot;Document - Program Name&quot;, i.e. 'Northwind - SSW Data Renovator'</div>
