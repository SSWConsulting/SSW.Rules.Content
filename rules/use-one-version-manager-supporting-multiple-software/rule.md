Managing software versions can be a complex and time-consuming task, especially when you're dealing with multiple applications across various platforms. In today's fast-paced digital landscape, having a unified solution that supports multiple software packages is invaluable. Imagine a single version manager that streamlines the process, ensuring that all your software remains up to date effortlessly. Let's explore the advantages and possibilities of using a version manager capable of handling multiple software applications, simplifying your workflow and enhancing your software management experience.

Every programming language or framework build upon it has its own version managers in community, such as NVM for Node.js, RVM for Ruby, and Pyenv for Python.

However, it is not a good idea to use different version managers for different software. It is better to use one version manager supporting multiple software.

### Option A: asdf (recommended)

✅ Reproducibility - Same package installation process yields the same output  
✅ Declarative configuration - Nix uses a declarative configuration format to describe packages and their dependencies  
✅ Extensibility - Developers can extend its functionality through plugins and custom builders

❌ Steep learning curve  
❌ Intrusive  
❌ Linux/Mac/WSL only
