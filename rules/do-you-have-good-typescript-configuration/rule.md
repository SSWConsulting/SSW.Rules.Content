<span class='intro'> <p>TypeScript is a powerful language that transpiles to JavaScript, and provides much desired type-safety and IDE refactoring support.&#160; But without good configuration, a lot of the benefits can be lost.</p> </span>

<h3>Use tsconfig.json</h3><p>Putting a “tsconfig.json” file in your project tells the typescript compiler where the root of your project is, and provides a centralized place to configure the compiler.&#160; This config is read by IDEs and the compiler and can be utilised by the build scripts to ensure configuration is consistent.</p><dl class="image"><dt> <img src="goodtypescriptconfig1.png" alt="goodtypescriptconfig1.png" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; A tsconfig.json file with great configuration</dd></dl><h3>Disable implicit “any”</h3><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">The primary benefit of TypeScript is type-safety, and attempting to escape from the type-safety should be a conscientious decision by the developer.&#160; So ensure that noImplicitAny is true, and keep your code type-aware and able to be refactored.</p><h3>Exclude external files</h3><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">By default, the compiler will compile everything ending in .ts.&#160; This means things inside node_modules and even typings will be parsed and included. &#160;Ensure you exclude these files to reduce your compile time and, more importantly, reduce your reported errors.&#160;</p><h3>Don’t rely on TypeScript for bundling</h3><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">TypeScript should compile in-place, and a single file input should produce a single file output.&#160; This reduces compile time, and puts bundling in the hands of a system that knows more about the modules – the module loader.&#160;</p>
<h3>Hide generated files from your IDE</h3><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Files generated from typescript get in the way – you don’t want to scroll through .d.ts, .js and .js.map files all the time.&#160; So hide them in the IDE.<br>In VSCode this can be done via the “files.exclude” key in the settings.json file.&#160; For a shared experience across the team, check this file into source control.</p><dl class="image"><dt> <img src="goodtypescriptconfig2.png" alt="goodtypescriptconfig2.png" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; VSCode settings.json file that hides generated files </dd></dl>
