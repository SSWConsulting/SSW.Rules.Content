Sometimes, ChatGPT may require more context or clarification to provide a helpful response. Encouraging the model to ask questions when it needs more information can improve the quality of its answers and prevent misunderstandings.

<!--endintro-->

Here are some tips for prompting ChatGPT to ask for more context:

* Invite ChatGPT to ask for clarification in the initial prompt if necessary
* Emphasize that it's okay to ask questions if the model doesn't have enough information
* Be prepared to provide additional details if ChatGPT requests them
* Consider adding "On each prompt, let me know roughly how many questions are left", to gauge if you want to answer all questions
* If you’re feeling lazy or short for time, you can even get it to only ask you multiple choice questions.
