The Power App Community Plan gives developers a dedicated environment with access to:

<!--endintro-->



* Power Apps (Canvas and Model-Driven)
* Premium Connectors
* Power Automate
* Common Data Service and more…

Best of all it’s completely free, yes there are some restrictions but they’re quite reasonable. The main ones being the environment is restricted to a single user and no ability to share apps.
