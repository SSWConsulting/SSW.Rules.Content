The prefix is used to give context to your blog posts (or other type of content), so users know what to expect.

<!--endintro-->

Example 1: Use "**CODE:**" when your blog post is about coding or "**VIDEO:**" when it has a video.

You should also use prefixes (based on the content, like lists) for grouping and a better scanning:
