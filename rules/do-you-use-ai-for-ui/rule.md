For the longest time we have been caring about mocking up the UI quickly before writing any code. We have an extensive [storyboarding](./storyboards) rule, and you all know about the [Michael Jackson](/ask-clients-approval) rule to get the Product Owner's initials before you start coding in anger.

When a web developer is handed design images, it can be a drag to spend the next few hours (or days/weeks) building the baseline components, HTML, and CSS before getting to the fun stuff.

Thankfully, AI-assisted tools are beginning to help with the more mundane aspects of this process, and sites such as [v0.dev](https://v0.dev) can produce React components (with the code) you can drop into your project to give you a huge headstart on the work!

## Boilerplate

Upload your designers' images and tweak the output with a few prompts to get ready-made components for your app. Just be careful - these tools will often take "creative liberties" with the designs, so keep an eye out.

## DIY devs

If you're a dev that likes (or is forced) to moonlight as a designer these tools can be a great timesaver in creating professional looking web components in a short amount of time. These tools aren't a substitute for actual designers, but if your choice as a developer is between these tools or MS Paint, then you'll get a lot of value from them.

## PoCs and Inspiration

Generative UI tools can be a great way to collaborate with stakeholders in realtime, as you can generate ideas and iterate over them using natural language prompts. This can give developers or designers a useful starting point and frame of reference to build a highly polished design.
