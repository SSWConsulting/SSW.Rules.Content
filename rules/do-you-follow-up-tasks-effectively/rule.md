<p>Sometimes you're not able to complete a task right away or anytime soon. In this case, people usually just say:<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">"I can't do this week, but I should have it done by the end of next week"<br></p><p>Another scenario is when the task should be done or will expire after a period of time. For example: </p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">"Send Google Analytics data after a month" or "Remove course banner after the course is completed"<br></p><p>Efficient people don't rely on their memory and instead, use some way to make sure they don't forget to do that task. The most common ways are to either make a note in a paper diary, stick a post-it note to his screen. But there are better ways.​<br><br></p>
