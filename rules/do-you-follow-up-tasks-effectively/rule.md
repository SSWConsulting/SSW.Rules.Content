<span class='intro'> <p>Sometimes you're not&#160;able to complete a task right away or anytime soon. In this case, people usually just say&#58;<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">&quot;I can't do this&#160;week, but I should have it done by the end of next week&quot;<br></p><p>Another scenario is when the task should be done or will expire after a period of time. For example&#58;&#160;</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">&quot;Send Google Analytics data after a month&quot; or &quot;Remove course banner after the course is completed&quot;<br></p><p>Efficient people don't rely on their memory and instead,&#160;use some way to make sure they don't forget to do that task.&#160;The most common ways are to either make a note in a paper diary, stick a post-it note to his screen. But there are better ways.​<br><br></p>
