Pure HTML pages are the fastest website around.  However, server-side scripting languages enable richer functionality. Static sites solve this problem by providing the best of both worlds. Static sites are

*	Cheap
  
*	Easy to use
  
*	Fast

On the other hand, complex functionality can be a bit more limited and time consuming to implement.

Two examples of static sites in action are [SSW People](https://www.ssw.com.au/people/) and [SSW Rules](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/).

There are a few hosting options to choose from including:

*	[Azure static web apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/static/) (recommended)

*	[Cloud Flare](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)

*	[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

*	[Surge.sh](https://surge.sh/)

There are also many different static site generators:
  
*	[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) (recommended)

    *	React based
  
    *	Lots of plugins
    
    * Data handling via GraphQL
    
    * Works natively with GitHub as a Datasource.
  
*	[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
    
    * Liquid based [(Shopifyâ€™s templating language)](https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/115244038-an-overview-of-liquid-shopifys-templating-language)
    
    * Simple to setup
    
    * Out of the box integration with GitHub pages
    
    * Scales poorly
    
    * [Windows is not supported](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/)
  
*	[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
    
    * React based
    
    * Server-side rendered pages but can be exported as a static site
    
    * Provides full control over which data handling technology you use
    
    * More scalable than conventional static site generators
