Pure HTML pages are the fastest website around.  However, server-side scripting languages enable richer functionality. Static sites solve this problem by providing the best of both worlds. Static sites are

*	Cheap
  
*	Easy to use
  
*	Fast

On the other hand, complex functionality can be a bit more limited and time consuming to implement.

Two examples of static sites in action are [SSW People](https://www.ssw.com.au/people/) and [SSW Rules](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/).

There are a few hosting options to choose from including:

*	[Azure static web apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/static/) (recommended)

*	[Cloud Flare](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)

*	[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

*	[Surge.sh](https://surge.sh/)

There are also many different static site generators:
