Pure HTML pages are the fastest website around.  However, server-side scripting languages enable richer functionality. Static sites solve this problem by providing the best of both worlds. Static sites are

•	Cheap
  
•	Easy to use
  
•	Fast

On the other hand, complex functionality can be a bit more limited and time consuming to implement.

Two examples of static sites in action are [SSW People](https://www.ssw.com.au/people/) and [SSW Rules](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/).

There are a few hosting options to choose from including:

•	[Azure static web apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/static/) (recommended)

•	[Cloud Flare](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)

•	[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

•	[Surge.sh](https://surge.sh/)

There are also many different static site generators:
  
•	[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) (recommended)

  o	React based
  
  o	Lots of plugins
    
  o	Data handling via GraphQL
    
  o	Works natively with GitHub as a Datasource.
  
•	[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
    
  o	Liquid based [(Shopify’s templating language)](https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/115244038-an-overview-of-liquid-shopifys-templating-language)
    
  o	Simple to setup
    
  o	Out of the box integration with GitHub pages
    
  o	Scales poorly
    
  o	[Windows is not supported](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/)
  
•	[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
    
  o	React based
    
  o	Server-side rendered pages but can be exported as a static site
    
  o	Provides full control over which data handling technology you use
    
  o	More scalable than conventional static site generators
