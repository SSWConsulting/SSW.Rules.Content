Usually, in small companies, there is one key stakeholder who approves everything. This system works great when the company is small because that person keeps the organisational vision and strategy aligned. However, as the organisation scales that person becomes a bottleneck causing issues throughout the company.

Luckily, there are ways to address this problem and keep the organisation running smoothly. One strategy is to create an employee responsibility which lists the people responsible for a specific approval.

<!--endintro-->

## How to assign an employee responsibility
1. The first step is to identify approvals for improvement. Look for an approval where people are getting stuck waiting for a bottleneck.
e.g. people are getting stuck waiting for approval for completing induction
2. Once an approval is identified, create a list of people who are experts on the topic who will be responsible for that approval.
3. Assign each person a priority. The original approval should be the lowest in priority to reduce their involvement as much as possible.
4. Induct each person in the list by having them do the approval with the original approver at least 3 times. This step ensures they understand the goal.
5. Record the list in a central repository with the name {{ APPROVAL }} Masters. They are now the ones responsible for that approval.
e.g. the Induction Masters are responsible for the approval of induction
6. Update the standard so that instead of contacting the original approver, they now they contact the list in order until they reach any 2 of the {{ APPROVAL }} Masters. If they get the go ahead from 2 approval masters, they are good to go!
Note: Why do they need 2? Having 2 people helps instill confidence in the process for the original approver.

Tip: if you think the approval may be controversial, it's a good idea to add in the original approver, so they don't get a rude shock.

## Benefits of this process
✅ Huge time savings for the original approver

✅ Less blockages for people seeking approval

✅ Maintained consistency and quality of approvals

## Communicate the new process
Ideally, this process should be added to as many bottlenecks in the business as possible. However, it can be difficult to know which approvals in the business are causing the most pain. 

That's where crowdsourcing comes in. Communicate this new approval process to the entire company, and ask people to be on the look out for places where it should be implemented.

Hopefully this communication results in feedback about where to put the approval process in place.
