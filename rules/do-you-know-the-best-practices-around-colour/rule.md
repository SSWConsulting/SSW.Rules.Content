Using colour in reports can bring them to life, or else make them confusing and noisy, so make sure you’re intentional with them.<br>

<h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">​Semantic colours</h3><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Remember that some colours have a shared understanding of their meaning.&#160;</p><ul><li>
      <b>Red</b> means pay attention or danger.&#160;</li><li>
      <b>Green</b> often means good.&#160;<br></li><li>Traffic lights can be used for showing 3 levels.&#160;</li><li>Cold, Warm, Hot should have appropriate colours that make sense without having to look at the legend</li></ul><dl class="badImage"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/colours-powerbi-bad.jpg" alt="colours-powerbi-bad.jpg" style="width&#58;746px;height&#58;352px;" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Bad example – non-semantic colours cause confusion</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/colours-powerbi-good.jpg" alt="colours-powerbi-good.jpg" style="width&#58;750px;height&#58;342px;" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; good example – obvious colours used for Cold, Warm, and Hot</dd></dl><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Tufte minimalism</h3><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Edward Tufte is often quoted as saying that, on a report where you want to draw the eye to exceptions or out of bounds data, colour should only be used to highlight what you want the user to see.&#160;</p><dl class="goodImage"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/tufte-good.png" alt="tufte-good.png" style="width&#58;750px;" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good Example – the black stands out as everything else looks translucent</dd></dl><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Consistent Palette</h3><p>Make sure you stick with one colour palette, so if you use one pastel colour, make them all pastel. If you have one bold colour, make them all bold</p><dl class="badImage"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/pallete-bad.jpg" alt="pallete-bad.jpg" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Bad Example – inconsistent palette feel like the colours clash</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/pallete-good.jpg" alt="pallete-good.jpg" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good Example – consistent colour palette</dd></dl><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Colour Blind palette</h3><p>Just to be difficult, it is worth noting that red/green colour blindness is the most common type, which may make standard semantic colours sometimes less desirable. In this case, use blues and oranges for contrast instead.<br></p><br><br>
