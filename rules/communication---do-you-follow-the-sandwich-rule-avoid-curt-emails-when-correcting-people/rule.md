<p>
                    The sandwich rule approach is an effective way to provide feedback to other team
                    members and clients.</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<ol>
                    <li>Start with positive feedback</li>
                    <li>Give your recommendations for improvement</li>
                    <li>End with some additional positive feedback (you may repeat #1)</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    This optimistic approach allows you to maintain a healthy relationship with your
                    team members and clients.</p>
