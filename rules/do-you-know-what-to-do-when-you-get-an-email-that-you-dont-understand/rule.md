Sometimes a task will not be clear, or you won't have sufficient context to understand what is required.

A bad approach is to simply delete the email or to reply with “?” and then delete it.

<!--endintro-->

What you should do is call the sender and ask for specifics, then reply to the email with an [as per our conversation](/Pages/DoYouAlwaysSendAnAsPerOurConversationEmail.aspx), documenting your new understanding of the task.

If you can't get hold of the person, email them back asking specifics of what you don't understand.
