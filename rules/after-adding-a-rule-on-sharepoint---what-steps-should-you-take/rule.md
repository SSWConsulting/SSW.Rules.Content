<ol><li>Check the rule in Office Word for <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/standards/rules/RulesToBetterTechnicalDocumentation.aspx#WordSpellingAndGrammarChecker" shape="rect">spelling or grammatical errors</a>&#160;(Warning&#58; Select the “Paste Plaintext” when pasting from Office Word to SharePoint&#160;or you will have a lot of work later to clean up the automatic generated HTML code by Office Word)</li>

    <li>Check the report and fix the errors</li>
    <li>Check in the page and repeat steps 2-3 until Link Auditor has all green ticks (alternatively, you can use &quot;Check my links&quot; app of Google Chrome to find the broken links)</li></ol>We also have a rule&#58; <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterWebsitesDevelopment.aspx#StepsAfterAddRuleOnAspxPage" shape="rect">Adding a rule in as px</a> <dl> <dt><img src="SPedit.jpg" class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" alt="" /> </dt> <dd class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; SharePoint as a content management system </dd> </dl>
