<p>When a user looks at a search result, they expect to see a list of items to look into. If there are no results, don't give them noisy text <span style="line-height:20.7999992370605px;">because it can be taken as a search result. An</span> icon also can be understood as a broken page. Your "no results" page should be clean.​</p>
