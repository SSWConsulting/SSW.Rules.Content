To see how to create a campaign and to use it effectively, please read [Rules to Better Google Ads](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=7d7a18e3-efa2-42ba-a335-d063c462efd7).

At SSW we use Google Ads before known as Google Adwords, to advertise our company, products, training, and events. It is a paid advertising product that promotes your business whenever people are searching Google. You only need to pay when someone clicks on your ad, which is known as cost-per-click (CPC) advertising. It is a great tool for directing more traffic to your website and expanding your brand awareness.

On the first business day of every month, it is recommended that you should send out a Google ads report to the relevant stakeholders with screenshots of your Marketing Dashboard (we use Power BI).

Make sure to cover:



* Number of opportunities vs. number of conversions that came through our Google ads.
* Compare results for the month in the current and previous year: clicks, impressions, the average cost per click, and cost. Explain why it increased or dropped.
* Add information about best campaigns and keywords, if any of them had a special improvement or was on 'the spotlight' during that month.
* Mention in percentage where sessions on our website came from. They could come from: Direct, organic, referral, paid ads, social media, and emails (newsletter). You can find at Google Analytics | Acquisition | Overview
* Add graphics to illustrate your report. Use Google ads or Power BI for cool screenshots.
* If you feel like you should add more relevant information, feel free to do it.
