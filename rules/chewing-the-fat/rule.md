No matter how well adapted your business and processes are, there's always room to improve and learn.
Once you've built a fantastic team of experts, it's important to actively listen to their opinions and ideas to continue building a great place to work and deliver more value to your customers.

In the highly dynamic space of software development, there's new frameworks, features and languages constantly being released, hyped, maturing and sunsetting.
No-one has the time to keep up with everything that's going on, so it makes sense to gauge the opinions of your team - there's a good chance that at least one of them has an opinion!

Setting up a regular schedule to collect everyone's opinion is great to build up a habit and ensure that you've always got new ideas coming in.

# Chewing The Fat
Gathering and actioning these opinions is a relatively straight-forward process which can be referred to as "Chewing The Fat" (CTF).
While it may be tempting to stick to only business oriented topics, it's a good idea to remember that this process works well to spread knowledge around your team and upskill everyone!

A typical CTF cycle has three core steps:
1. Publish an article on a new technology or process that you'd like to explore as a team
2. Send out a survey to everyone on the team, asking them to review the article and give their feedback
3. Review the results and implement feedback

## 1. Publish an article
If you're excited about a shiny new technology or process change that you've read about, choosing a topic for the article will be easy.
Sometimes it may be a bit more difficult, this is where your team could contribute ideas that they want discussed.

Write up an article and publish it somewhere appropriate for your team to access.
Make sure to include [bad and good examples](/use-bad-and-good-examples) to really get your point across.

## 2. Send out a survey
Once the article is published, send out a survey to your team and set a deadline for submissions.
Without a deadline, it's difficult to start the review process as responses can come in well after you've moved on to the next CTF cycle.

In the survey, ask for the team's ideas on 

## 3. Review results
Once the deadline has passed

# Stay Regular
It may sometimes be tempting to skip a scheduled CTF, but to maintain habits, it's important to try to send one out anyway.
One simple idea for a CTF that could be used in times when you may not have anything else to talk about is how you implement your CTF process itself.
This way you can get feedback from your team on what they think of the process and any changes (or ideas for future editions) they may have.
