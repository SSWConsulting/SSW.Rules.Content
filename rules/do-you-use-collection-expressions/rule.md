Do you know collection expressions can make your code cleaner? They can be used to create arrays, lists, and other collections in a single line of code.

<!--endintro-->

```cs
var numbers1 = new List<int> {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

```cs
var numbers2 = new[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
```

::: ok

:::

```cs
List<int> numbers3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

Another advantage of collection expressions is that they can be passed into methods accepting different types of list collections. The compiler is smart enough to determine the correct underlying type.

```cs
Foo([1,2,3]);
Foo2([1,2,3]);
Foo3([1,2,3]);

void Foo(IEnumerable<int> numbers)
{
    // Do work
}

void Foo2(List<int> numbers)
{
    // Do work
}

void Foo3(int[] numbers)
{
    // Do work
}
```
