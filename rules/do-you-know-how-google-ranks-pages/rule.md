<span class='intro'> <h4 style="margin&#58;15px 0px 0px;font-family&#58;verdana, sans-serif;font-size&#58;12px;color&#58;#000000;line-height&#58;21px;"></h4>What makes Google so successful?&#160;The answer to that is Google's Page Rank Algorithm. You can read about the early days of the page rank algorithm here&#58;&#160;<a href="http&#58;//infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html">The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine.</a><div><br>The actual Page Rank algorithm looks like this&#58;&#160;<b>PR(U) = (1-d) + d * sumV(PR(V)/N(V))</b>.&#160;Here PR = Page Rank, U is the page we're looking at, d is a constant damping factor and V is a page that links to our page.<br>The basic premise that comes from this algorithm is&#58;<br></div><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">When I link to your page, I'm casting a vote that your page is good and the more links (votes) that are received the better the page is.​<br></p> </span>

<p>​​<span style="line-height&#58;20px;">This statement alone sent shockwaves through the webmaster community and sent many webmasters on an endless quest for links. All pages begin with an equal page rank, which is then moved around based on the internal and external links to and from that page.</span></p>It's important not to forget that Page Rank is not the only factor involved in a search. Essentially Google completes the following steps when you perform a search&#58;<br><ol><li><span style="line-height&#58;20px;">Finds all pages matching the keywords of the search</span><br></li><li><span style="line-height&#58;20px;">Rank accordingly using &quot;on the page&quot; factors (proximity between words, frequency, repetition etc.)</span><br></li><li><span style="line-height&#58;20px;">Calculate the relevancy of&#160;inbound anchor text</span><br></li><li><span style="line-height&#58;20px;">Uses the page rank to decide what order to display the results in</span><br></li></ol>So looking for people to link to your site will only become important if you've got the first three discriminating factors nailed.<br>
