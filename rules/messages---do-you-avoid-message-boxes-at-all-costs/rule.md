<span class='intro'> <p>Now, if you can't get rid of message boxes; try again.</p>
<p>There is nothing quite as annoying as persistent pop up message boxes, demanding your attention. Imagine you are working on a train, you are in between two fat people and your elbows are tucked in. Not only that the trackpad barely works and the user does not know that [spacebar] works on a message box.</p>
<p>Now think of that scenario every time you give a user a message box.</p> </span>

â€‹<div>Exception&#58; Only use them in the following scenarios&#58;</div>
<ul><li>Confirming the deletion of a record</li>
<li>Kicking off a long running process that cannot be cancelled</li></ul>
