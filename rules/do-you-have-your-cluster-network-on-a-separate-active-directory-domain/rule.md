Being able to communicate with the domain is so important for Hyper-V and clustering. To protect yourself from Active Directory problems, you can completely separate your primary Active Directory domain. 
<!--endintro-->

Having a separate Active Directory domain will allow your Hyper-V machines to run without problems in the case that your main Active Directory domain fails for any reason.

When you setup a new Active Directory domain for your Hyper-V cluster, create a trust between to 2 domains.
