Your focus when bidding is dependent on your campaign goal.

Focus points to consider:

<!--endintro-->

* **Clicks**  – if you want people to visit your website
* **Impressions** – if you’re looking into increasing brand visibility
* **Conversions** – if you’d like a specific action on your website (e.g sale!)
* **Views** – consider it for videos only
* **Engagements** – looking for interactions with your ad? Clicks or calls would be the right answer (general clicks, calls, ask for directions, etc)
