<span class='intro'> <p>​​User-schema separation allows more flexibility​ by adding another level of naming and shifting ownership of database objects to the schema, not the user. So, is it worth doing? Unless you are working with a very large database (100+ tables), the answer is &quot;no&quot;. Most smaller databases have all objects with owner &quot;dbo&quot;, which is fine in most cases.​<br></p> </span>
