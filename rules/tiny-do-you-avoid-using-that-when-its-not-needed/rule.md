<span class='intro'> <p>​</p>'That' is occasionally an unnecessary addition to a sentence, especially if it's a title that would benefit from being short and punchy. As such, avoid using &quot;that&quot; in a title wherever possible.<div><p class="greyBox">&quot;Building Software that People Understand&quot;</p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad">Figure&#58; Bad Example - unnecessary &quot;that&quot;</dd><p class="greyBox">&quot;Building Software People Understand&quot;</p><div><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Figure&#58; Good Example - without the &quot;that&quot;, the setence is concise and&#160;has more punch</dd>​</div></div> </span>
