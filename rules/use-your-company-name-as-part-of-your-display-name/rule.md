Using your company name as part of your display name has the double advantage of firstly branding, and secondly, indicating to other parties that your IM account is for work purposes.

Keep in mind that while you can change your display name, you may not be able—or want—to rename your actual account. That’s why it’s best to use your **full name**. If you go by just "Peter," others may have trouble telling you apart from the three other Peters they know.

**Tip:** If you travel around, people often will ask you _"Where are you?"_. You can avoid this by putting the square brackets where you currently are. E.g. [SSW Brisbane] or [Cisco Melbourne].
