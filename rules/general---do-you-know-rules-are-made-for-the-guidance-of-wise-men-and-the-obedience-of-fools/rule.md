  <p><strong>​​​Standards should *not*&#160;be followed blindly. Aim for continual improvement.</strong></p>
<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Whenever you're doing something more than once there should be a clear procedure. We call them “standards” or “rules”. That means that there should be lots of standards.​<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">But there are pros and cons to having standards.<br></p>
