Attention to detail plays a vital role to effective communication. Spelling and syntax errors, though seemingly minor, can significantly affect the clarity and professionalism of your writing.

<!--endintro-->

### Common language pitfalls

Embracing the modern standard not only keeps your writing current but also ensures consistency in your communication.

* Use **"email"** not _"e-mail"_ or _"EMail"_
* Use **"cannot"** not _"can not"_
* Use **"website"** not _"web site"_
* Use **"username"** not _"user name"_
* Use **"taskbar"** not _"task bar"_
* Use **"aka"** not _"a.k.a"_
  
  **Note:** Although Wikipedia considers multiple ways to spell the acronym for "also known as", the convention is simply "aka" - All letters are in lowercase and letters are not separated by dots/spaces.

### Syntax changes the meaning of certain words

Often when writing technical documents, you will instruct the reader to 'set up' his PC or run a 'setup' file.

* **"Setup"** is a noun, basically meaning an 'arrangement'(e.g. _"The software setup"_)  
* **"Set up"** is a phrasal verb, most commonly meaning 'to establish something.' (e.g. _"To set up a computer"_)

How can you remember this? Mentally replace "setup" or "set up" with "setting up". If the sentence still basically makes sense, use two words. If it doesn't, use the single word. For example, the sentence _"...he is setting up the shop"_ makes sense. _"The setting up was all wrong"_ does not.

### Be careful with homophones

Words like “verses” and “versus” are homophones, meaning they are pronounced the same but have different spelling and different meanings. Always ensure you are using the correct word. If you're not, it won’t be picked up by spell checkers.

* **“Verses”** refers to lines of poetry or bible passages (e.g. "Matthew 5:41 is one of my favourite bible verses")
* **“Versus”** refers to 2 or more parties in opposition to one another, especially in sports or legal situations (e.g. "Floyd versus Mayweather")

::: info
“Versus” can be shortened to “vs.”, which is common in sporting situations, or “v.”, which is the standard abbreviation for legal scenarios.

#### More examples

* **"Their"** shows possession (e.g. _"It's their car"_)
* **"There"** indicates a place (e.g. _"It's over there"_)
* **"They're"** is a contraction for **"they are"** (e.g. _"They're going to the party"_)

* **"Principal"** can refer to a person who leads a school or organization or can mean the original sum of money (e.g. _"The school principal is retiring" or "The principal amount of the loan"_)
* **"Principle"** refers to a fundamental truth, rule, or value (e.g. _"Honesty is a guiding principle in their company"_)

* **"Weather"** relates to the state of the atmosphere (e.g. _"The weather is sunny today"_)
* **"Whether"** is used to introduce choices or possibilities (e.g. _"I'm uncertain whether to attend the meeting"_)
