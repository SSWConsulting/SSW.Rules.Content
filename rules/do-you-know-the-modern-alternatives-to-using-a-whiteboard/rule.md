<p>A great way of collaborating a team or presenting a new solution to a client is using a visual display of&#160;your recommendations. Using a&#160;whiteboard is a great way of collaborating and brainstorming which&#160;works quite well. But a physical&#160;whiteboard is a large ugly object that takes up a fair amount of room, often isn’t kept clean, and doesn’t allow for people to collaborate remotely. There are modern alternatives that work even better, let's have a look at them.&#160;<br></p><p>Software consultants often use architecture diagrams to present a solution to the client. These&#160;graphical representations are used to&#160;help all of the stakeholders, the developers, the designers and the clients visualise the high-level&#160;structure of the system&#160;or application&#160;to ensure it covers all of the client requirements.&#160;<br></p><dl class="image"><dt><img src="/SiteAssets/modern-alternatives-to-using-a-whiteboard/architecture_diagram.png" alt="architecture_diagram.png" style="width&#58;750px;height&#58;356px;" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Architecture diagram exist on established projects after many discussions​<br></dd></dl><dl class="image"><dt><img src="/SiteAssets/modern-alternatives-to-using-a-whiteboard/hand-drawing.png" alt="hand_drawn_diagram.png" style="width&#58;750px;height&#58;456px;" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; When working with people online, drawing on some paper, taking a photo, and emailing it… is the *least* collaborative way to work</dd></dl>

They’re not a sign of a modern office.<br>Sometimes they are useful and I know some people really like them (generally older people).<br>I have seen the digital whiteboards (usually targeted at teachers) but I think they are horrible to use.<br>The common scenario is for a spec review. I am always happy when I see devs using their device and casting to the TV. And the subsequent notes get saved to Microsoft Teams.</p> ​
