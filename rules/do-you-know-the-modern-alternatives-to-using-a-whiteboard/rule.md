<span class='intro'> Many people like to use a whiteboard for collaborating and brainstorming, and this works quite well. But a whiteboard is a large ugly object that takes up a fair amount of room, often isn’t kept clean, and doesn’t allow for people to collaborate remotely. There are modern alternatives that work even better&#58;<br> </span>

They’re not a sign of a modern office.<br>Sometimes they are useful and I know some people really like them (generally older people).<br>I have seen the digital whiteboards (usually targeted at teachers) but I think they are horrible to use.<br>The common scenario is for a spec review. I am always happy when I see devs using their device and casting to the TV. And the subsequent notes get saved to Microsoft Teams.</p> ​
