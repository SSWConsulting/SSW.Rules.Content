When creating URLs, it's important to stick to lowercase letters. Some search engines and servers see URLs as case-sensitive, which means you cant use uppercase and lowercase URLs interchangably.
This is especially problematic when URLs that only differ in case lead to the same page, this can hurt your site's search ranking as search engines often penalize duplicate content.

Also, using mixed case URLs can add confusion for users.

If you need to use uppercase letters, make sure they're used consistently across your site to reduce potential issues.
