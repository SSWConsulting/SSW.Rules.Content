When creating URLs, it's important to stick to lowercase letters. Some search engines and servers see URLs as case-sensitive, which can lead to problems. For example, a URL with mixed casing might not be recognized correctly. This is especially problematic when URLs that only differ in case lead to the same page, causing duplicate page issues. This can hurt your site's search ranking as search engines often penalize duplicate content.

Also, using mixed case URLs can make it harder for users to type them in accurately.

If you need to use uppercase letters, make sure they're used consistently across your site to reduce potential issues.
