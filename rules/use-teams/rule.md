You can use teams within a repository to manage a whole group's permissions instead of setting permissions for each new member of the organisation.

See [Organizing members into teams](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/organizing-members-into-teams).

Correctly configuring your organisation's teams structure will make it easy to give members the permissions level that they need. You can add teams to repositories to manage their roles.

Another benifit of using teams is that you can metion a whole team in a discussion instead of individual members. See [Mentioning people and teams](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#mentioning-people-and-teams)
