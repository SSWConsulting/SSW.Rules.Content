<span class='intro'> Using Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) lets you use one account to log into multiple systems, through Single Sign-On (SSO).<br> </span>

<p>â€‹ADFS is built upon SAML 2.0 protocol (Security Assertion Markup Language), allowing secure exchange of authentication data.</p><p>With ADFS, you can use only one account (generally created on your on-premises Active Directory (AD) server) to log into multiple systems e.g. Dynamics 365 CRM, Office 365 and many others.</p><p>This implementation gives you security over which users are acessing which application with which accounts, and also reduces the surface for attacks on having many accounts with many different passwords&#58;</p><p><img src="sso.png" alt="sso.png" style="margin&#58;5px;" />&#160;</p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Figure&#58; Good Example - Using one account on many systems</dd><dt><br></dt><dt>ADFS also gives you a solution in other corner cases&#58;</dt><dd><br></dd><dd>&#160; 1.
