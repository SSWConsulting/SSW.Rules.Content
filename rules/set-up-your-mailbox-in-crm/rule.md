   - **Allow to Use Credentials for Email Processing:** No
   - **User Name:** `UserName@company.com`
   - **Server Profile:** Microsoft Exchange Online
   - **Incoming Mail:** Server-Side Synchronization or Email Router
   - **Outgoing Mail:** Server-Side Synchronization or Email Router
   - **Appointments, Contacts, and Tasks:** Server-Side Synchronization

If you need more guidance on setting it up, you can find more on Microsoft documentation: [Set incoming and outgoing email synchronization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/admin/set-incoming-outgoing-email-synchronization).

After this is done, you should [install the Dynamics 365 App for Outlook](/dynamics-crm-install-the-dynamics-365-app-for-outlook).
