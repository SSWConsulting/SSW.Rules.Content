<span class='intro'> <p>It is impossible to exactly remember every configuration setting in an MSCRM install. A historical log of the installation is hugely valuable when there are problems after installation is completed and helps to correctly re-install if required. The easiest and most convenient way of doing this is to take screen captures of every screen and paste them into a Word document. E.g. _InstallSteps_CRM2011.docx<br></p>
                 </span>

<p>You will also need this because you are going to do this in a Dev, then Test and then Production environment aren't you &#58;-)</p>
                <dl class="image">
                    <dt><img alt="DevErrors in web.config" src="/PublishingImages/CRM-screen.jpg" /></dt>
                    <dd>Figure&#58; This is the last dialog before it installs. So you want a screen capture of everything up to here - so you can replay it for the Test and Production servers</dd>
                </dl>
