<span class='intro'> Backlinks are a big part of Google's ranking algorithm, and one way to take advantage of that is to make sure that you always comment on people's blogs... this could be to ask a question, or just to say thanks, but make sure you add a link back to your company website after your name.<br><br>Example&#58;<div><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">Thank you, that worked for me<br>Ulysses Maclaren <a href="https&#58;//ssw.com.au/">www.ssw.com.au​</a>&#160;<span style="background-color&#58;#ffffff;">​</span></p></div> </span>

<p>On the management side, you can see if your employees are doing this by googling (in this case) &quot;Ulysses Maclaren www.ssw.com.au&quot;&#160;during annual reviews to see how much google juice they are adding to your website.</p>
