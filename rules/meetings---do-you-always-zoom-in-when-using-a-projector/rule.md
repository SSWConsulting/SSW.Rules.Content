<span class='intro'> <p>It is a common problem that people will tend to use the default screen resolution when displaying something on a projector for a room full of people to read. This is difficult for people to see because of the distances involved.</p> </span>

<p>It is always better to zoom in by holding down the CTRL button and scrolling up on the mouse.</p>
