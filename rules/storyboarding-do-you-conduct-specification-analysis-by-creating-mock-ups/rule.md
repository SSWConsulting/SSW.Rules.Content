​​​Complex documentation can waste time. Many user requirements can be best encapsulated in screen mock-ups. Spend more time on mockups compared with time on documentation. <br><br><br>

<p>Storyboarding is a technique taken from movie production.&#160;</p><dl class="image"><dt> <img src="/PublishingImages/movie-storyboard.jpg" alt="Movie Storyboard" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Movies are expensive to produce, so directors do storyboards first and then the product designer, costume designer, lighting people etc. all know what they need to do for each scene</dd></dl><p>There are five primary types of mockups&#58;</p><ol><li> 
      <b>Hand drawn Mockups</b></li><li> 
      <b>Wireframe Mockups</b></li><li> 
      <b>Developer HTML Mockups</b></li><li> 
      <b>Designer HTML + CSS Mockup</b></li><li> 
      <b>Designer Photoshop Mockups&#160;</b>(recommended)<br></li></ol><p>Often it's best to start with some hand-drawn ones to get started. Then&#160;if you have access to designers,&#160;complete a couple of full 'Designer Photoshop Mockups' for &quot;look and feel&quot; approval,&#160;then complete the balance as wireframes.</p><h3>Hand drawn Mockup</h3><p>'Hand drawn Mockups' are recommended to be done with the customer. Since it doesn't deal with any styling/color issues, 'Photoshop Mockups' will be needed after.</p><dl class="image"><dt> <img src="/PublishingImages/Hand-Drawn-Mockup.jpg" alt="Hand drawn Mockup" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; A 'Hand drawn mockup' example.

   <strong>Tip&#58;</strong> The tools to develop a wireframe depend on your skillset and the front end technology chosen.

      <strong>Warning&#58;</strong> Don't go down the track of giving a customer a few concepts (on some projects we gave 2 or 3 completely different concepts by different designers). There becomes too much mixing and matching when they see them. Once the images are approved, then the designers slice them up and turn them into HTML (slicing is the exporting of each image).</p></div><dl class="image"><dt> <img src="/PublishingImages/1d6c03_PSMockup.jpg" alt="Designer Photoshop Mockup" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Designer Photoshop Mockup example - recommended as quick to change, when changes happen </dd></dl><p> 
   <strong>More information – Add notes at the bottom</strong></p><p>Wireframes should include numbers (in orange circles) and notes at the bottom, explaining features and/or indicating priority.</p><dl class="goodImage"><dt> <img src="/PublishingImages/wireframe-with-notes.jpg" alt="Wireframe with Notes" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; This wireframe indicates priorities of features </dd></dl><p>Mock-ups notes should also include the business rules that apply to the page.

An example of a throwaway prototype is when you design screens in Access, but the application will be HTML. So design the screens you and the customer are happy with the technology you will be using, and then use them in the app.</li><li>It is best to have a designer and developer and customer working together.</li><li>Get the mock-ups <a shape="rect" href="/Pages/AskClientsToInitialYourWork.aspx">physically initialed</a>, especially if you are performing a fixed-price contract. Yes, paperless is great - but not in this case.</li><li>If you can't get mock-ups initialed, then page by page approval over email is the 2nd best option.</li><li>A tip I picked up from Tom Howe was to&#160;always add a client's branding into the mockup - it makes a big impression</li><li>Mock-ups should follow <a shape="rect" href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterInterfaces.aspx">standard interface rules</a> </li><li>Write the related business rules at the bottom of each screen - and turn into unit tests.<br></li></ul></div><h3>Related Rules</h3><ul><li>
