Complex documentation can waste time. Many user requirements can be best encapsulated in screen mock-ups.

There are 3 levels of mockups:

1. **Low Fidelity Mockups** 
2. **High fidelity Mockups** (recommended)
3. **Interactive Mockups**

Often it's best to start with a low fidelity mockup to get started. Then  complete a high fidelity mockup for "look and feel" approval, and if time permits create an interactive storyboard.

### Low Fidelity Mockups

Creating a low fidelity design mockup can be achieved through various methods including wireframes, paper prototypes, and other similar techniques. It can be valuable to have the product owner on call when creating a low fidelity mockup to get immediate feed back and direction.

Start by identifying the key features and functionality that product should have. This will help you focus your efforts and ensure that your mockup accurately represents your intended product.

Then create a basic wireframe of your design. A wireframe is a visual representation of the layout and structure of your website or app. You can use software tools like Figma , Adobe XD, or Sketch to create digital wireframes. Alternatively, you can use paper and pencil to sketch out a rough wireframe by hand.

Next, add more details to your wireframe by adding boxes and labels for different features and elements. For example, you can add boxes for buttons, input fields, and images. You can also label each box with a brief description of what it represents.

Once your low-fidelity design mockup has been approved, you can use it as a reference point for creating a high-fidelity mockup. 

### High Fidelity Mockups

A high-fidelity mockup is a more detailed version of a design that includes visual design elements such as typography, colors, and images. It is created using specialized design tools such as Adobe Photoshop or Sketch and takes more time to create than a low-fidelity mockup.

**Warning:** Don't go down the track of giving a customer a few concepts (on some projects we gave 2 or 3 completely different concepts by different designers). There becomes too much mixing and matching when they see them.

Use a design tool such as Adobe Photoshop or Figma to create a high-fidelity mock-up of the website or app's interface. This will include detailed designs of individual UI elements such as buttons, forms, icons, and typography.

**Incorporate branding:** It's important to incorporate the brand's visual identity into the design of the website or app. This includes using the brand's color scheme, typography, and logo in the design.

### Interactive Fidelity

To make the mock-up more realistic, add interactivity to it. This includes designing how different elements will respond to user input, such as hovering over buttons or clicking on links and being taken to new pages.

### Tools

* [Figma](https://www.figma.com) (Reccommended)
* [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) (Mac Only and for UX designers)
* [Moqups](https://moqups.com/) (HTML5 based App)
* [UXPin](http://uxpin.com/) (more sophisticated, helps you create responsive designs)
* Adobe photoshop

### Summary

Mock-ups have more clarity than bulky design documents.

For example, to communicate that “a customer has many phone numbers”, a storyboard/wireframe of how that relationship will appear in the user interface is highly more likely to be understood by the client.

Clear communication of the message is more important than the medium used to convey that message.

Here are some more hot tips on mock-ups:

* It is best to have a designer and developer and customer working together.
* Get the mock-ups [physically initialed](/tasks-do-you-know-to-ensure-that-relevant-emails-are-attached-to-tasks), especially if you are performing a fixed-price contract. Yes, paperless is great - but not in this case.
* If you can't get mock-ups initialed, then page by page approval over email is the 2nd best option.
* A tip I picked up from Tom Howe was to always add a client's branding into the mockup - it makes a big impression
* Mock-ups should follow [standard interface rules](/rules-to-better-interfaces-general-usability-practices)
* Write the related business rules at the bottom of each screen - and turn into unit tests.
