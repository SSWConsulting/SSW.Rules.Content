When you are presenting, you should always do a tech check before you start. This will ensure that you are ready to go and that you don't have any technical issues during your presentation. Ideally, this happens the day before an event.

When you are ready to do the tech check, call the AV team and ask them to walk you through what to check.

Some common things to check are:

- Mics
- Speakers - Audience can hear the prestenter and computer audio
- Displays
- Cameras
- Lighting
