Passwords are a legacy technology that is not fit for the purpose that we use them today. We're working our way towards a post-password world, in particular the [FIDO alliance](https://fidoalliance.org), and many biometric technologies, including fingerprint and face recognition that you may have in your phone. But for now, passwords are something we all need to live with.

<!--endintro-->

We're used to seeing lists of password requirements, such as:

- Minimum length
- Complexity (e.g. must include upper and lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters)
- Minimum age (e.g. you canâ€™t change it more than once in 24 hours)
- Maximum age (e.g. you must change it every 30 days)

The most important of these is **length**.

Look at this graphic:

This table clearly shows that adding complexity (mixing upper and lower case, adding numbers, adding symbols) **does** increase the time it takes an attacker to brute forces your password, but not by much, and **only** in conjunction with a password of sufficient length.

In 2022, 10 characters should be the **absolute minimum** for a password. 12 characters is a better baseline, and 16 is what you should aim for.
