You should reply like this:
Dear Peter 

If it was a quick 5 mins I would do it straight away. However I need to do a little investigation - maybe a couple of hours. 

If that is OK then here is a [link to purchase 2 hours](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Shop/BasketInsert.aspx?ProductID=SUPP2) and I will spend that time on this and let you know how I go.
