When a company is small, Annual Employee Reviews start as a fairly informal process. The head of the company might take employees for a walk, or generally have a chat about different topics.

As the company grows and more people join, 2 problems start to occur:
1. Reviews start to get longer as scope increases.
2. Other people need to start doing reviews but aren't clear on the processes.

For these reasons, it's important for all the review managers to get aligned about what topics and performance indicators need to be covered, and to ensure scope is limited.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are a tool for standardizing how performance is measured at a company and ensuring employees are aware of what they need to focus on. Then the manager can use the KPIs as a waypoint when doing the Annual Employee Review.

### How KPIs should be used
KPIs are a tool for evaluating employee performance during an Annual Employee Review. 

There should be a standardized list of KPIs that the Review Manager uses to collate scoring data about how well the employee is doing in each area.

Each KPI would have a weight denoting how important it is, and a score denoting how well the employee has done.

The result is a final score and % showing the performance of the employee.

### Benefits of KPIs
KPIs are beneficial because they provide:
* Standardized metrics for measuring performance
* Clarity around expectations for employees
* Quicker Annual Employee Review

#### Qualitative vs Quantitative KPIs
While many organisations opt for quantitative KPIs, it's difficult to build a system that factors in all the nuance of performance. 

Qualitative KPIs provide more room to make a subjective judgment.

::: warning
KPIs are just 1 indicator of performance, and they do not represent an employee's entire value. Additionally, they may not fit every employee well. Make sure to use KPIs as a talking point and combine it with your personal judgment to perform the final evaluation.

### Metrics to measure
