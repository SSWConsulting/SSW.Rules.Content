We know that the way your inbound links are worded does make a difference, they play an important factor when Google searches are made by search engine users. Google uses the words between your &lt;a href&gt; tags to decide which websites are the most relevant to the search terms.

Having these relevant words on links also gives a more friendly experience to the users.

<!--endintro-->
 For example, if SSW had a million inbound links that described the site like this...  
&lt;a href="http://www.ssw.com.au"&gt;Movies for Free&lt;/a&gt;
...when someone searches for "free movies" on Google, it would point to us.  
So what does this mean? All those that are pointing to pages on your website that are displayed as 'More', 'Link', 'This' or 'Click Here' aren't doing you any favors when it comes to increasing your Google rankings.
