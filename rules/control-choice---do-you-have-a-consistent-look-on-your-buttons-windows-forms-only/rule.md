Question: What is wrong with this Picture?
<dl class="image">&lt;dt&gt;<img alt="Inconsistent Button FlatStyles" src="../../assets/InconsistentButtonStyles.jpg">&lt;/dt&gt;
<dd>Figure: What is wrong?</dd></dl>
<!--endintro-->

 **Answer:** There are three different types of buttons in the Application:

* *Next >* - Default Window Style
* *Preview* - .NET Flat Style
* *Cancel* - Window XP Style

<dl class="image">&lt;dt&gt;<img alt="bad divider" src="../../assets/BadDivider.gif">&lt;/dt&gt;
<dd>Figure: Even labels need to use FlatStyle.System. Can you spot the wrong label?</dd></dl>
