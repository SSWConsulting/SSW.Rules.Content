The problem with emailing a task, is that no one knows how important that email is, in relation to all their other emails. So, what is the solution?

<!--endintro-->

There are the 3 ways people can send tasks:

1. Send an email only.

2. Put the task straight into the backlog, and send no email:

3. Send an email, the recipient reviews it and places it into the backlog, based off the specified Business Value. Developers often prefer this method if they like control over their backlog.

### The perfect email workflow


Before you email a task to someone, think about how important it is to you.  Then draft your email, add the Business Value using the same scale that you would use to estimate your PBIs.

**Q:** What if you need to write an email to multiple recipients?
 **A:** Assign each person a Business Value. In the case of "To Myself" emails, you can also add the amount of 'Effort' required too.
