Generally you will add Javascript to the form to give client side validation.

<!--endintro-->

Given JavaScript is difficult to debug and doesn't get precompiled this can save           a lot of time rather than re-publishing all the form changes and having to reload           and refresh the forms manually.
           These events can be trigged using the Preview menu from the form customization environment.
