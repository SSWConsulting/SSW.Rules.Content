### What is salary sacrificing for electronic devices

In Australia, salary sacrificing is when your employer agrees to pay for your device(s) with your pre-tax salary, therefore you pay less tax.

Most companies will let you salary sacrifice FBT-exempted ([Fringe benefit tax](https://www.forgov.qld.gov.au/finance-and-procurement/finance-travel-and-assets/taxation-and-financial-management/manage-taxation/fringe-benefits-tax-fbt)) portable electronic devices that:

* Are used predominantly for work-related purposes
* Are easily portable and designed for use away from an office environment
* Are small and light
* Can operate without an external power supply
* Are designed as a complete unit

This provides you with a wide variety of work-related devices that you could salary sacrifice and save money on. Some devices such as laptops, tablets, phones, and headphones are just some of the examples.

Accessories (such as cases and chargers) can be included in a salary sacrifice arrangement only if they are necessary for the basic operation of the electronic device. Accessories bundled into the price by the retailer can be included in the arrangement.

### The benefits of salary sacrifice

Salary sacrificing has many awesome benefits:

✅ You pay for your devices in pre-tax dollars (a saving of approximately 30% depending on your tax bracket)

✅ You don’t pay GST (saving you another 10%)

✅ Less admin - Nothing for you to do at tax time

✅ You get to choose your device - and you own it

✅ You can get something with more powerful than you could have without the savings

**Tip:** As an added benefit, both you and your company can coordinate to [incorporate some branding into the asset](/brand-your-assets) through salary sacrifice.
