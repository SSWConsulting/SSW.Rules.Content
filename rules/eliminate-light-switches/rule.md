Manual light switches create friction. Someone has to remember which rooms need bright light, mood light, or darkness. Worse, the last person out might forget to turn everything off, so the office burns energy all night.

<!--endintro-->

With a smart automation system you can manage the whole office from a phone or tablet. The Control4 app lets you adjust scenes, set schedules, and monitor energy use without leaving your seat.

## Why eliminate wall switches

1. Reduce energy waste by scheduling lights to turn off when meeting rooms are empty
2. Improve accessibility for people who cannot reach traditional switches
3. Keep the office looking clean without plastic plates on every wall

## How to roll it out

1. Map each office zone in the Control4 app so every light has a clear name
2. Create default [Control4 scenes](https://docs.control4.com/help/c4/user/userguide/content/topics/lighting/lighting_scenes.htm) for events such as daily open hours, after hours cleaning, and client presentations
3. Give staff a short introduction so they know how to launch the app and trigger a scene

::: bad
Figure: Bad example - Light switches everywhere. Visitors guess which button controls the boardroom and employees leave lights on accidentally
:::

::: good
Figure: Good example - Control4 app - named rooms, timers, and remote access so you keep the office lit perfectly without touching a wall plate
:::

Finish by scheduling routine checks. Once a quarter, confirm the Control4 scenes still match how the office is used and update names or schedules as needed.
