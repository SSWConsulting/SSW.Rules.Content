Microsoft Azure SQL Database has **built-in backups** to support self-service Point in Time Restore and Geo-Restore for Basic, Standard, and Premium service tiers.

<!--endintro-->

You should use the built-in automatic backup in Azure SQL Database versus using T-SQL.

T-SQL: CREATE DATABASE destination_database_nameAS COPY OF[source\_server\_name].source_database_name

Azure SQL Database automatically creates backups of every active database using the following schedule: Full database backup once a week, differential database backups once a day, and transaction log backups every 5 minutes. The full and differential backups are replicated across regions to ensure the availability of the backups in the event of a disaster.

### Backup Storage

Backup storage is the storage associated with your automated database backups that are used for Point in Time Restore and Geo-Restore. Azure SQL Database provides up to 200% of your maximum provisioned database storage of backup storage at no additional cost.

| Service Tier | Geo-Restore   | Self-Service Point in Time Restore | Backup Retention Period | Restore a Deleted Database |
| ------------ | ------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Web          | Not supported | Not supported                      | n/a                     | n/a                        |
