​When you encounter a bug in your application you should never let the same bug happen again. The best way to do this is to write a unit test for the bug, see the test fail,&#160;then fix the bug and watch the test pass. This is also known as Red-Green-Refactor.<br><div><br></div><div>Tip&#58; you can then reply to the bug report with&#160;&quot;Done + Added a unit test so it can't happen again&quot;<br><br></div>
