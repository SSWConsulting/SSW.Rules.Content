It is not a good idea to have spaces in a folder or file name as they don't translate to URLs very well and can even cause technical problems.

Instead of using spaces, we **recommend**:

- **kebab-case** - using dashes between words

Other **not recommended** options include:

- **CamelCase** - using the first letter of each word in uppercase and the rest of the word in lowercase
- **snake_case** - using underscores between words

This rule should apply to any file or folder that is on the web. This includes Azure DevOps Team Project names and SharePoint Pages.
