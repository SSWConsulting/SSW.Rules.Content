Whenever you need a number from a system you should think of how you can create a report, so next time you can press a button to get the result.

<!--endintro-->

If you found yourself doing ad-hoc reports, or random SQL queries, a few years ago, the best thing to do was to make sure the boss knows you could not find the data you needed, so he could commission a new report to be built.

Since 2015, the best practice is instead to jump into Power BI and build the report yourself.

 **Subject: Report needed** 

Dear boss,

Today I needed to find xxx and so I had to write a query to find it. You can find it at \\server\Reports\_Adhoc\SalesByRegion.xlsx

I suggest adding this into our Performance Point Cube so I could find it at a URL.
