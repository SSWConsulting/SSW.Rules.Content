<p>If you find yourself doing adhoc reports, or random SQL queries you should make sure the boss knows you could not find the data you needed.</p>
                    <dl class="goodImage">
                    <dt>
                        <img alt="Eg. Email your boss to ask a number" src="/PublishingImages/CreateReport.JPG" />
                    </dt>
