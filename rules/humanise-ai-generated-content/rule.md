Creating content that sounds human is essential for engaging readers and meeting quality standards. AI-generated content can sometimes feel robotic, lacking the natural flow and personal touch that human writing possesses.

We can use specific techniques to make ChatGPT's content more human-like, improving its readability and relatability.

<!--endintro-->

## 1. Use personas

Assign ChatGPT a specific role, such as a friendly advisor or an expert in a particular field, to guide the tone and style.

**Prompt example:** _"As a seasoned travel blogger, describe the best destinations for solo travelers."_

## 2. Incorporate personal experiences

Share personal anecdotes or opinions to add authenticity.

**Prompt example:** _"Include this story about my favorite childhood memory related to the topic: {{ ADD STORY }}"_

## 3. Fact insertion

Add relevant and recent facts to make the content more informative and credible… Things that the AI’s cut off date mean it couldn’t know.

**Prompt example:** _"Include these statistics on the current market trends for this industry: {{ ADD FACTS }}"_

## 4. Perplexity

Avoid common AI phrases and terms that make the text sound unnatural. Perplexity measures the complexity and unpredictability of text. To make AI-generated content sound more human, avoid overused and predictable phrases. This enhances the natural flow and makes the content more engaging.

**Prompt example:** _"Don’t always use the most natural words. Use the following words fewer than three times on this page: unique, ensure, utmost, meticulous, meticulously, navigate, navigation, digital era, art of, secrets of, ever-evolving, unlock, bespoke, realm of, utilize, synthesize, conceptualize, paradigm, leverage, pivot, robust, synergy, optimize, utilize, orchestrate, cultivate.”_

## 5. Burstiness

Vary sentence and paragraph lengths to create a dynamic flow.

**Prompt example:** **"Mix short and long sentences to enhance readability."**

## 6. Unfluffing

Ensure every sentence provides value and is actionable, removing unnecessary filler content.

**Prompt example:** _"Eliminate vague statements and focus on specific, useful information."_

## 7. Adding flavor

Make the content more engaging and conversational by adding humor, anecdotes, and a conversational tone.

**Prompt example:** "Engagement is the highest priority. Be conversation, empathetic, and occasionally humerous. Use idioms, metaphors, anecdotes, and natural dialogue."

## 8. Targeting specific audiences

Tailor the content to the preferences and needs of your target audience.

**Prompt example:** _"Adjust the tone and vocabulary to match the reading level and interests of a young adult audience."_

## 9. Training on your writing style

Provide samples of your own writing to train ChatGPT to mimic your unique voice.

See [Do you know how to train an AI to write in your style?](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/train-ai-to-write-in-your-style) for a deep dive into how to do this effectively.

## 10. Avoid em dashes (—)

Too many em dashes make text feel mechanical and AI-generated. Instead, use commas, colons, or full stops for a more natural flow.

**Prompt example:** _"Write this without using em dashes. Replace them with commas, colons, or periods where appropriate."_
