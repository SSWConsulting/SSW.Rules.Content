It can sometimes be hard to work out when to use a lead vs a contact and company, or even an opportunity.

**Figure: There is only one scenario where you would use a lead** 


It is better to have all your contacts in one place rather than split over 2 separate           tables. Leads are not needed except as a data entry tool to help you link new contacts,           companies, and opportunities. See [Quick Way to create an opportunity, contact and account in one step](/Pages/Leads-can-be-converted-to-Opportunities-Contacts-and-Accounts.aspx).

The only legitimate use of leads is for completely unqualified data, e.g.

* You buy a contact database (too large to be able to contact each one of them to qualify)
