On occasion, you may be asked in the morning or even halfway through the day to pause your work by the client. Scenario:

1. Developer X shows up in the morning and starts working on feature Y as per CRM Service Calendar
2. Client calls and says “We’re sorry but we have to pause the development of feature Y because XYZ”

The reaction from Developer X should be:

“OK, I will call my Account Manager and make sure *future* bookings are cancelled until further notice. 
For today, is there anything else I can work on so you get the best value out of the rest of my day?”

Note: Same-day cancellations still incur that days costs. If there is nothing more you can work on and the client is unhappy, refer the client to your Account Manager.
