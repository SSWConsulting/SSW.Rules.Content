On occasion, you may be asked in the morning or even halfway through the day, to pause your work by the client.

Scenario:

1. Developer X shows up in the morning and starts working on feature Y as per CRM Service Calendar
2. Client calls and says “We’re sorry but we have to pause the development of feature Y because XYZ”

The reaction from Developer X should be:

> “OK, I will call my Account Manager and make sure _future_ bookings are cancelled until further notice.
> For today, is there anything else I can work on so you get the best value out of the rest of my day?”

**Note:** Same-day cancellations still incur that day's costs. If there is nothing more you can work on, and the client is unhappy, refer the client to your Account Manager.
