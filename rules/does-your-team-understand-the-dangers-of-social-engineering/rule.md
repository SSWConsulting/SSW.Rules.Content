<span class='intro'> <p>As developers when we think security we commonly become fixated with issues in the code, out of date software versions or incorrectly configured firewalls. However, we miss one glaring vulnerability which there is no patch for... our users. <br></p><p>Social engineering is a technique which mixes art and science to exploit common human behaviours to compromise information systems. The following is a classic example of social engineering performed over the phone. <br></p><div class="ms-rtestate-read ms-rte-embedcode ms-rte-embedil ms-rtestate-notify"><iframe width="760" height="428" src="https&#58;//www.youtube.com/embed/DB6ywr9fngU?rel=0" frameborder="0"></iframe>&#160;</div><p>​<br></p> </span>

<p>There are numerous examples of social engineering ranging from phone calls, attackers posing as friends on social media, all the way to sophisticated attempts at phishing users with near-perfect clones of popular websites.</p><dl class="image"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/social-eng.png" alt="social-eng.png" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; <a href="https&#58;//www.troyhunt.com/its-time-that-you-vulnerable-human/">‘Do you think the average consumer could spot the phishing site?’</a> Source&#58; Troy Hunt</dd></dl><p>The only solution to social engineering is to train properly and prepare users about the dangers presented by and common techniques used by malicious individuals. For useful information on the topic reference the document ‘<a href="https&#58;//www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014">Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks’ by the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team </a>&#160;or the Pluralsight course <a href="http&#58;//app.pluralsight.com/courses/ethical-hacking-social-engineering">Ethical Hacking&#58; Social Engineering by Troy Hunt </a>.</p><p class="p1">With the above in mind, it is important to review regularly the information availed via search engines and standard operating procedures. Furthermore, it can be useful to test the readiness and alertness of staff by performing mock social engineering attacks.</p><p class="p1">Take the following situation as an example&#58; the CEO is out of town and decides to use an employee’s laptop left in the office on the weekend, the employee in question is messaged via Skype for their domain password. If the employee is aware of the risks, this poses the company then they would not send the requested credentials and follow proper procedure around reporting a suspected incident.</p>
