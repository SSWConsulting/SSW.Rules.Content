When users fill out a form to make an appointment or download an ebook, it's common for businesses to collect basic contact details. Unfortunately, many forms neglect to ask for a phone number, or if they do, they don't make it a required field. This oversight can lead to missed opportunities for follow-up and converting a lead into a customer.

By collecting phone numbers and following up with a phone call, you can significantly increase your chances of converting online leads into customers. Make sure your forms are designed to gather all necessary contact information, and prioritize personal, immediate follow-ups to build trust and engagement with your prospects.

⚠️To comply with [privacy laws](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/your-privacy-rights/your-personal-information/consent-to-the-handling-of-personal-information), forms that collect personal information must include a distinct, unselected consent checkbox. This checkbox allows individuals to opt in for additional communications beyond the original purpose for which the data is being collected.

## The importance of phone follow-ups

Following up with a phone call can dramatically increase the likelihood of converting a lead into a customer. A phone call adds a personal touch, builds trust, and allows for immediate engagement and clarification. In fact, a majority of sales are completed over the phone, highlighting the importance of this method.

### Key points

* **Instant connection:** A phone call provides a direct line to the prospect, allowing you to answer questions and address concerns in real-time
* **Personal touch:** Hearing a human voice can create a more personal connection than an email or text message
* **Immediate feedback:** You can gauge the prospect's interest and adjust your approach based on their responses

Most forms only ask for an email address, leaving out the phone number. This limits the ways you can follow up with a lead.

Even when forms include a phone number field, it's often optional. This results in incomplete contact information for many leads.

Include a phone number field in all your forms and make it a required field. This ensures you have the necessary information to follow up with leads effectively.

### Boost your sales team’s proficiency

Train your sales team to **prioritize phone calls when following up with leads**. Here are some important elements to focus on for training sales teams to make effective follow-ups via phone calls:

* **Script development:** Structured call scripts provide salespeople with key talking points and responses to common objections, ensuring consistency and effectiveness in communication
* **Role-playing exercises:** These simulate real-life scenarios and help salespeople practice and refine their pitch and response skills, preparing them for actual calls
* **CRM utilization:** Training on how to use CRM tools effectively helps sales teams track interactions, set reminders, and access customer data, ensuring timely and informed follow-ups
* **Personalization techniques:** Encouraging personalization of follow-up messages based on previous interactions makes the communication more relevant and engaging for prospects
