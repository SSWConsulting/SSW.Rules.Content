<span class='intro'> <p>
                    Be prepared for the initial meeting because first impressions are the most important.
                    Preparation cements your professionalism and underscores SSW's eye for detail and
                    capacity to deliver.

<p>Preparing for the meeting includes&#58;                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensuring the sales staff attending the meeting are familiar with the relevant technologies.</li>
                    <li>Reviewing the clients website or other available information, taking special note
                        nature of the clients business. It's also useful to remember the office locations
                        (e.g. one office, nationwide or international) and the year of commencement of business</li>
                    <li>Reviewing any specification documents the client may have provided. You may conclude
                        the current specs are incomplete and further work is required to develop a Release
                        Plan</li>
                    <li>Have the standard SSW sample apps VPC to show SSW developed websites, windows apps
                        and our products (Client Demo VPC)</li>
                    <li>Having a wireless card to access the Internet if you cannot connect to the clients
                        network. In fact it is preferred you do not connect to the clients network due to
                        time and security issues</li>
                    <li>Having the <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/SSW/Company/SSWPresentation_ver4-5.pptx">
                        standard sales presentation</a>. Remember, while clients don't want to
                        think this is you first job, they rarely like to listen to how many CommBanks, NRMAs
                        or Pfizers you've done work for. Clients generally prefer the focus of the meeting
                        to be their business. You will however consider any previous projects which bear similarities
                        to the project on offer, you do need to prove our competency</li>
                    <li>Have all the information that was recorded during the <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/SSW/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterInboundCalls.aspx#Preparation">
                        initial call</a></li>
                    <li>A hard copy of the <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/SSW/Standards/Forms/ConsultingOrderTermsConditions.aspx">
                        Consulting Order Terms and Conditions</a> may be useful for them to review when
                        the meeting is concluded</li>
                    <li>Plenty of business cards (that haven't been sitting in your wallet for three months!)</li>
                    <li>Turning up early!</li>
                </ul>
