GPT-3 and ChatGPT are similar tools that serve slightly different purposes. Each of them has strengths and weaknesses so it's crucial to understand the right time to use them.

ChatGPT helps you do a task e.g. "Write me a blog post on EF Core Code-First Migrations", "How do I create a table with EF Core?"GPT-3 does the task automatically e.g. "Create a system that outputs new SSW rules", "Create a universal translation system", "Create a system for summarizing a page of text"

ChatGPT is strong at helping an individual do a specific task. For example, a user could could get responses to simple tasks like:
* "Write me a blog post on EF Core Code-First Migrations"
* "How do I create a table with EF Core?"
* "Can you help me find information about Northwind?"
* and much more...

On the other hand, GPT-3 is better for tasks that require automation or programmatic integration. For example, it could be used to create systems for:
* Outputting new SSW rules
* Performing universal translations
* Summarizing a page of text
* and much more...

Additionally, GPT-3 provides [an API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api) that developers can leverage.
