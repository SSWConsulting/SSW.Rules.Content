At SSW we evaluate and use a lot of 3rd party libraries. Before considering a library for further evaluation we ask the following questions:

<!--endintro-->


* Is it open source?
* Is the licence LGPL, Apache, or MIT? [Comparison ofÂ licences](http&#58;//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_software_licenses)
* Is there a quick start guide?
* Is there a FAQ?
* Is there an API guide?
* Is it easy to install? Is there a NuGet package?
* Is there an active user community?






If the answer is yes to all of these questions then the library is definitely worth further evaluation.
