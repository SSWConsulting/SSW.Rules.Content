A compliance sheet is a detailed document or tool used by companies to track and manage their compliance obligations. This sheet includes a list of all important lodgements, payments, and other regulatory requirements that need to be fulfilled by specific deadlines. 

By systematically recording these obligations, the compliance sheet helps businesses ensure they meet all their legal and financial responsibilities in a timely manner.

The compliance sheet typically includes:

- **Deadlines**: Specific dates for when each obligation is due
- **Descriptions**: Brief descriptions of the obligations (e.g. tax lodgements, payroll taxes, and other regulatory filings)
- **Responsible Parties**: Names or roles of individuals responsible for ensuring each task is completed
- **Status Updates**: Current status of each obligation (e.g. pending, completed, overdue)
- **Reminders**: Alerts or reminders for upcoming due dates

financial penalties, legal repercussions, cash flow disruptions, reputational damage, operational interruptions, etc.

Understanding these potential problems highlights the necessity of maintaining a detailed compliance sheet.
