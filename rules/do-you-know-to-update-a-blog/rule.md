When you update your blog post, use the word "UPDATED" clearly (in capitals and in red for example). The date should also be added, if relevant.

Example:

::: greybox
UPDATED: 1 August 2010 [summary of what you changed]
:::

![Figure: OK example – Although Peter has the right idea, he needs to think more of a global audience -        See live](RulesBloggingUpdate\_OKPeter.jpg)  

::: good  
![Figure: Ultimate example – Mike has gotten into the swing of things -        See live](RulesBloggingUpdate\_UltimateMike.jpg)  
:::

You should also apply this technique to youtube videos you record too.
