Boolean Properties must be prefixed by a verb. Verbs like "Supports", "Allow", "Accept", "Use" should be valid. Also properties like "Visible", "Available" should be accepted (maybe not). [Here is how we name Boolean columns in SQL databases.](https&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulestoBetterSQLServerdatabases.aspx#BitFields)

public bool Enable { get; set; }

We have a program called [SSW Code Auditor](https&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/) to check for this rule.
