When sending a standardized follow-up email after an out-bound call, you should always try to tailor your email to each client.

If you don't then the client will ignore your email.

These are the 5 things that you should include in your follow-up email:


<!--endintro-->

1. Record what was said in the conversation including:
    * the projects they are working on
    * their priorities
    * the technologies they are interested in
2. When you will call them back
3. Other relevant answers to questions in the script you are using.
4. A little footer, with a clear division to the 'spam'/'canned' text
5. Indent the spam text




All this information is important as it gives the next salesperson who speaks to this person a good background on your interaction with them.
