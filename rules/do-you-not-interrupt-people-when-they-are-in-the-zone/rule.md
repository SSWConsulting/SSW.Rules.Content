If you interrupt someone when they are in the zone, it can take them 15 minutes to get back into the zone.

<!--endintro-->

Instead of interrupting someone directly, you can:

* Send them an email to contact you when free (preferred option)
* Ping them on Microsoft Teams or Skype with the message “See me when you are free”
