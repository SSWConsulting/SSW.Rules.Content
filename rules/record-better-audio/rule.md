Audio is one of the most important things to get right in a video as many viewers will tune out if the sound is not good, because if you can't hear someone properly it makes it more difficult to understand them.

<!--endintro-->
### Background Noise
Having sounds in the background during a recording can be very distracting, and sometimes irritating to a viewer, e.g. construction, traffic, someone in the kitchen banging pots and pans.

Try these tips to minimize unwanted noise:
1.	Timing – schedule your recording during a quiet part of the day (e.g. avoid meal-times and breaks)
2.	Block out & dampen sounds – reduce the amount of noise by physically obstructing it:
    -	Close all doors and windows - a sealed space will reduce a large amount of noise
    -	Create a barrier – put obstacles in between your microphone and the unwanted noise (e.g. use a wall divider, or stack some boxes to make a wall)
    -	Use Carpet/Rugs – soft materials will cut down on echo and ambient noise
3.	Mic distance – putting your microphone closer to your audio source will make your desired audio louder, and unwanted noise will be less noticeable

### Silent Spaces – Record “Room Tone”
Room Tone is the ambient noise in a room when no sound is being produced, like a room’s audio fingerprint.
The sound is shaped by many things, including the room’s size, shape, and objects, as well as noise created from appliances, e.g. refrigerators.

As these sounds are constant and consistent, editing software that can remove a lot of this noise, making your audio recordings much nicer.
Having these spaces will also make editing much easier, (e.g. Intro and Outro graphics can fade in over these spaces)
1.	When you start recording, wait 30 seconds before you begin.
2.	When you finish your presentation, stay in your position for an extra 30 seconds.
3.	Smile! Don’t forget you are still on camera.

### Microphone Patterns
Recording Patterns are a way to refer to the most sensitive parts of a microphone – the areas where the most sound will be picked up.
Some high-end microphones will have options for Recording Patterns, including:
-	Stereo: uses a left and right channel, so sounds will feel like it coming from a specific location. Good for music.
-	Omnidirectional: picks up sound equally from all around the mic. Best for recording multiple speakers.
-	Cardioid: picks up sounds directly in front of the microphone. Best for recording a single speaker.
-	Bi-Directional: picks up sounds directly in front and behind the microphone. Best for recording in between two speakers.

### Record Locally


When recording a Microsoft Teams or a Zoom call (e.g. an interview) the software will automatically compress the sound, reducing the quality. 
So that your final video has the best sound quality:
1. Record the audio locally (e.g. you can use Windows' Voice Recorder app)

This higher quality audio should be used in post-production eg. When editing in Adobe Premiere Pro.
