Unfair situations happen all the time in the workplace, so it is important to make sure you are aware of the trigger points and what strategies you can put in place for dealing with these scenarios.

There are 10 ways you can make yourself feel better and help others reach their potential...

### Speak up
It is super important to make sure your thoughts are heard, otherwise nobody will know there is a problem.

### Happiness is relative
Understand that your happiness is relative. It is key to be aware that you don't need to compare yourself with others. Instead, focus on yourself.

### Get one thing, lose another
When you attain something it usually comes at a cost. A lot of very successful people have had to give up a lot in other aspects of their life. 

### The happiness equation
The happiness equation helps you understand how to increase happiness. It looks like this:

```
Expectations - Reality = Happiness
```

Try to manage your expectations or increase your reality by speaking up.

### Luck
Know that luck exists and affects everything you do. It is better to accept it rather than dwell on it.

### Compete with yourself
Competing with yourself can drive you to achieve greater heights. Scrum is a great example of this since you are trying to improve your performance each sprint.

### People don't want to be unfair
Most people don't set out to be unfair and usually they have some reasoning behind their decisions. Try not to take things personally.

### Squeaky wheel gets the most oil
When you are constantly raising issues then more information comes back to you and you keep on improving.

### Make expectations attainable
Try to temper your expectations so that they are realistic to meet but high enough to push yourself. If your expectations are too high it will be difficult to feel happy but if they are too low you won't be reaching your full potential.

### Celebrate others wins
Try to give credit to those who achieve wins, it is awesome to give positive reinforcement to others and they will remember you for it. Maybe later on they will return your positive words by helping you achieve a win.
