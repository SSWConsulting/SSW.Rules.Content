### When to use checkboxes in UI design

Checkboxes are used in forms and databases to indicate an answer to a question, apply a batch of settings or allow the user to make a multi-selection from a list. Alternatively, a single checkbox may be used for making single selections – such as Boolean True or False statements (e.g. “Do you agree with the terms and conditions? Yes or no”).

CheckBoxes are also suitable to use for enable or disable sections and to tell the user that these sections do not need configuring for the application to run.

:::

Checkboxes allow the user to select one or more from a  wide range of options. Applications use a series of checkbox groups to help the user filter search criteria.

If there are only two options available on the form (usually a yes/no answer), the use of a checkbox is more intuitive than radio buttons. Only use radio buttons if there are more than two options.
