* Ad Set - During this stage is when you select your keywords, these can be optimised later and should be monitored regularly for negative keywords, check the rule on Google Ads optimisation at “[Do you know how to optimise Google AdWords Campaigns](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=5410d39d-233a-43f3-8c8a-99d8364d7ae2)”
