Being able to find an email quickly in Outlook is an important skill, and many of the following techniques will also help you in your Google/Bing searches too.  

<!--endintro-->


Let's take an example scenario and see what tips we can use to search. Last month, you got an email in your inbox from your manager Bob about making changes to how you see data in his Northwind App.

### Tip 1: Giving the person I’m talking to focus
You know Bob sent the email, and that it's in your inbox. So the best things to do first is to limit outlook to only your inbox folder and only emails from Bob. So while in your inbox:

* Change the folder to "Current Folder"
* Search for "From:Bob"


### Tip 2: Focus on the person (i.e. to: from: cc: bcc:)

### Tip 3: Focus on the subject (i.e. subject:)
If you have a good idea of what the email subject contains, then the "subject:" scope can help a lot. For example, if you know that the email had Northwind and Bob in the subject then you could:

* Search for "Subject: Northwind Bob"

### Tip 4: Use negatives (i.e. –) 



### Tip 5: Use quotation marks (i.e. “”)

### Tip 6: Combine 2 searches into 1 (i.e. OR)

### Tip 7: Find a file (i.e. hasattachments:yes)

### Tip 8: Find a file’s content (i.e. attachment:)

### Tip 9: Focus on the date received (i.e. received=<>)

### Search Scope

Restricting the scope of the search (i.e. where you are searching) can be a great way to limit the number of results to make them more manageable.

![Figure: The 1st thing to understand is the scope of what you are searching](search-scope.png)

* If you start a search from your Inbox, the default uses Current Mailbox (i.e. all of the folders in your mailbox), but you can restrict it to just your Inbox by clicking “Current Folder”
* If you start the search from a more specific folder (e.g. Deleted Items, Junk, or Sent Items), the default uses Current Folder

### Syntax

There are some syntax tricks that are usable in Outlook as well as Google, and these should be used often to hone down the number of results so you can find what you need.

* – (“dash” symbol)

  * To remove irrelevant items
  * E.g. jobs -apple
  * Tip: Start with a broad search, and then, when you start seeing irrelevant results about invoicing, add -invoice to your search
* “” (“double quotes” symbol)

  * To specify these words one after the other in this order
  * e.g. “Smith James” will not find James Smith
  * Useful when using common words but you know they were written in an exact phrase. E.g. “on top of this”
* OR

  * To give alternatives that may exist in the email you’re trying to find
  * E.g. truck OR lorry
  * Tip: Must be upper case... lowercase “or” won’t work

### Outlook Specific

Email has plenty of metadata that can be sifted through to find the right one, and many of these are available from the ribbon.

![Figure: You can also refine the metadata of your email to find what you want](email-metadata.png)

* Subject:

  * If you know a word was in the email subject
* From:

  * If you know who the email was from
* To:

  * If you know who the email was to
* CC:

  * If you know someone specific was CCed
* hasattachments:yes:

  * This is often useful when you’re looking for a particular attachment, rather than the email itself
* attachment: 

  * The contents of PDFs and Word docs are indexed too, so you can specify a word or phrase that exist in the attachment to help you find it
* received>1/1/2020: 

  * To limit the results to only a particular time period
