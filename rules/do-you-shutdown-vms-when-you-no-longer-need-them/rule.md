Often we use Azure VM's for presentations, training and development. As there is a cost involved to store and use the VM it is important to ensure that the VM is shutdown when it is no longer required.

<!--endintro-->

Shutting down the VM will prevent compute charges from incurring. There is still a cost involved for the storage of the VHD files but these charges are a lot less than the compute charges.

Please note that is for [Visual Studio subscriptions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/developer-tools/visual-studio-subscriptions/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-33518).

You can shutdown the VM by either making a remote desktop connection to the VM and shutdown server or using Azure portal to shutdown the VM.
