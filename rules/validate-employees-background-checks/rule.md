Hiring the wrong person can be a costly mistake—especially when working with clients who entrust you with access to secure systems. At SSW, we’ve seen firsthand that a slick résumé or strong interview performance isn’t enough. That’s why we put every candidate through rigorous testing and checks to ensure they have the right skills, communication style, and integrity for the role.

### Why background checks matter

Background checks are not just about avoiding “bad hires.” They:
* Protect your reputation with clients  
* Safeguard access to sensitive systems and data  
* Ensure compliance with government or client-mandated requirements  
* Build trust with your team and customers  

### SSW’s approach to validation

At SSW, our validation process goes beyond standard HR practices:  

1. **Skills Testing** – We run practical technical assessments to verify the candidate’s abilities.  
2. **Communication Testing** – Clear communication is critical, so we test it directly.  
3. **Reference Checks** – We validate every hire with past employer or colleague references.  
4. **Security Vetting (case-by-case)** – For employees needing [Baseline Security Clearance](https://www.protectivesecurity.gov.au/personnel-security/clearances), we conduct federal police checks.  
5. **Onshore Resourcing** – Wherever possible, we use onshore resources, often required by our clients.  
6. **Citizenship Verification** – When a project requires Australian citizenship, we ensure compliance before assigning a consultant.  

### Case-by-case requirements

Not every role requires the same level of vetting. For example:
* A frontend developer on a public website may only need reference checks.  
* A consultant working inside a government client’s secure environment may require federal police clearance and proof of citizenship.  

By tailoring the level of background checks to the role and client requirements, you balance efficiency with security.

### Final tip

Always communicate to clients that you take validation seriously. It reassures them that your consultants won’t become a risk factor and shows that you’re proactive about compliance and trust.
