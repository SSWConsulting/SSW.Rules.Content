If you have a bunch of text to sum up, it can be time consuming to extract the most important parts. If you want a simple way to keep the important stuff, you should use chain of density (CoD).

## What is Chain of Density?

CoD is a way to make short but detailed summaries. It works automatically with one prompt:

- Add important stuff step by step
- Use feedback from people to check quality
- See how it does against the usual GPT-4 way

## Why Use CoD?

### Keep it Short but Full of Info

::: greybox
Add important details one by one.
:::

::: good Figure: Good Example
You keep only the info that matters most.
:::

### What Do People Say?

::: greybox
Ask people what they think to make it even better.
:::

::: good Figure: Good Example
Feedback helps you make the summary useful for everyone.

## CoD vs Regular GPT-4

### Which is Better?

::: greybox
Regular GPT-4 can be off the mark.
:::

::: bad Figure: Bad Example
It might include stuff you don't really need.
:::

::: greybox
CoD aims to be more focused.
:::

::: good Figure: Good Example
CoD is usually more on point.

## How to Do CoD?

### Example Prompt

Here's an example prompt you can use to do CoD:
