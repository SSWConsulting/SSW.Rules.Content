It’s easy sometimes to accidentally undersell something or someone by using potentially derogatory words that may give a client the wrong idea.
 
<!--endintro-->

This can be especially bad if you’re using potentially triggering words or phrases:

> XXX is more junior/less experienced/less skilled than YYY.
::: bad
Bad Example – Why are they paying for a junior, a less experienced, less skilled person?
:::

> XXX is more affordable than YYY.
::: good
Good Example – Avoids trigger words like “junior” and has a positive spin and an upside for a client.
:::

> XXX needs more time to learn this technology.
::: bad
Bad Example – Why are they paying for someone to learn?
:::

> There’s always a short period of upskilling in any project until everyone’s fully proficient in the whole stack.
::: good
Good Example – Normalizes the issue
