A “Too<br>slow” is not enough info.

<!--endintro-->
Request<br>an image of the “Resource Monitor”
Then<br>after you decide there is justification:

•           Do a typical action – take a new<br>image or baseline.

•           give the additional resources e.g. Ram<br>and processors….

•           Do the typical action again – take<br>another image of the “Resource Monitor”

•           If there is some improvement, reply<br>“done” (otherwise reply “not done”)



Note:<br>An ideal email subject prefix for more resources would be e.g. “Performance issue<br>– “Machine name”
