Always include the relevant URL to your "Done" emails, like when you make a change to a webpage or document. This way people can check the work that was done. 

If you are using a task tracking system like **Azure DevOps**, **GitHub**, or Jira, also include the link to the PBI/issue/task.

**Tip:** Sometimes it is [important to give context and reasoning](/do-you-add-context-reasoning-to-your-emails) to your 'Done' emails too.

### Ensure your changes are live

**Scenario:** PR waiting for approval.

::: bad
Figure: Bad example - Link is included but changes are not live yet
:::

::: greybox
(PR waiting for approval)  
Done - ssw&#46;com&#46;au/rules/dones-is-your-inbox-a-task-list-only 

:::
::: ok
Figure: OK example - Link is included, changes are not live yet, but people are aware
:::

**Scenario:** PR approved and merged.

### Ensure others have permissions

It is a common problem where someone CC'd will not have permissions to see a file and the sender knows this. You should still add the link but inform the recipient.

**Scenario:** Recipient doesn't have permissions.

::: greybox
Done - onedrive.live.com/file-name.xls
:::
::: bad
Figure: Bad example - Link is included but recipient won't be able to open it, potentially generating more emails
:::

::: greybox
(link for reference - you don't have permissions)  
Done - onedrive.live.com/file-name.xls
:::
::: good
Figure: Good example - Link is included and people are aware of permission issues
