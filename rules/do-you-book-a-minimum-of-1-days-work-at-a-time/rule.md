<p>It takes as much effort to book 1 hour as to book 1 day, therefore your efficiency of sales work to billable work goes down when you book in multiple small appointments instead of 1 big one.</p><p>When booking in client work always make sure you ask the client to gather enough work for 8 hours of work. The minimum amount of time per booking is 8 hours. See Rules to Better Sales Account Management -
