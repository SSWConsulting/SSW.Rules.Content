Sometimes, you may come across text in a YouTube description that appears to be a link but lacks the familiar blue color plus underline and isn't clickable. This often happens because the text is missing the "https://" prefix.

Modern content editors and web browsers usually recognize this prefix as an indicator that the text should be converted into a clickable link. Without it, the text remains plain and doesnâ€™t function as a hyperlink.
