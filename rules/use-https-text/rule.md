Have you ever seen the text in an email or YouTube description meant to be a link to a page and wondered why it's missing the customary blue underline or can't be clicked?

The answer is simple: the links are missing the prefix " https:// ", a prefix most modern content editors or browsers recognise as link identifiers and convert otherwise normal-looking text into easily clickable links.

![❌ Figure: Bad example the URL does not include https:// prefix. The URL is not short and readable.](url-https-image-1.png "Bad Example")

Read the rule [Do you make URLs short and readable?](/create-friendly-short-urls) for a better understanding of how to create good URL's.

![✅ Figure: Good example. https:// prefix included making it a link. The URL has been made short and readable](url-https-image-2.png "SSW Video with a valid user link")

Adding " https:// " to the text makes the link easier to click which encourages more people to click on the link.
