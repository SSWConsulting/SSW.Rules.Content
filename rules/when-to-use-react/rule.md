[Angular](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Angular.aspx) is great  for building large enterprise applications but it is a full framework that works best as a full application.

[React](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/React.aspx), however, is easier to embed on another framework or application such as Office 365 or Sharepoint.
