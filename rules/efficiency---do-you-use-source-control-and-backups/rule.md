                    As a responsible employee, there should be no excuse for ever losing data, especially
                    if it belongs to a client. For this reason, it's important to make sure&#58;
                </p> </span>

<ul>
                    <li>Your backups are working properly</li>
                    <li>You are using source control for any code you develop</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If you are working onsite, you can still use TFS remotely and it's important to
                    talk the client into this in order to avoid any possible disasters.
