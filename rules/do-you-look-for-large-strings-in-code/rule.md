<p>â€‹To make hard-coded strings easier to find, <a href="/do-you-highlight-strings-in-your-code-editor">consider highlighting them in your IDE</a>.</p>

<span class="ssw-rteStyle-FigureBad">Figure&#58; Bad Example - The connection string is hard-coded and isn't easy to see in the IDE.</span>

<span class="ssw-rteStyle-FigureBad">Figure&#58; Better Example - The connection string is still hard-coded, but at least it's very visible to the developers.</span>
