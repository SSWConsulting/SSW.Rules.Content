Ensuring health and safety in the workplace is a fundamental responsibility for all businesses. A commitment to health and safety not only protects workers but also fosters a positive and productive work environment. This commitment should be evident in all aspects of business operations, from adhering to safety standards to promoting a culture of safe behavior.

### Key Principles for Health and Safety Commitment

To effectively demonstrate a commitment to health and safety, businesses should focus on the following principles:

#### Adherence to Health and Safety Standards

* **Compliance:** Follow all relevant health and safety standards, policies, and procedures that apply to your work.
* **Training:** Provide regular training to ensure all employees are aware of and understand these standards and procedures.

#### Safe and Healthy Workplace

* **Workplace Safety:** Ensure that the workplace is safe and healthy for all employees. This includes maintaining clean, hazard-free environments and providing necessary safety equipment.
* **Care for All Impacted:** Extend care to the workers, communities, and customers affected by your business activities. Regularly assess and mitigate any potential risks they may face.

#### Promoting Safe Behaviour

* **Recognition:** Recognize and reward safe behaviour among employees. Encourage a culture where safety is prioritized and celebrated.
* **Information Sharing:** Share information on safety practices and incidents to prevent unsafe behaviour. Promote open communication about health and safety concerns.

### Practical Implementation Tips

To put these principles into practice, consider the following tips:

* **Regular Safety Audits:** Conduct regular safety audits and inspections to identify and address potential hazards.
* **Employee Engagement:** Involve employees in safety planning and decision-making processes. Encourage them to report safety concerns without fear of retribution.
* **Safety Drills:** Organize regular safety drills to ensure everyone knows how to respond in case of emergencies.
* **Health Programs:** Implement health programs that promote physical and mental well-being, such as fitness activities, counselling services, and health screenings.

### Handling Workplace Concerns

SSW strives to maintain an open, warm, and healthy workplace culture. However, if issues arise, it is crucial to address them promptly and effectively:

* **Raise Concerns Promptly:** If you have any workplace concerns, conflict, or problems, no matter how small, raise them as quickly as possible.
* **Speak to Your Manager:** Initially, bring up concerns with your State Manager. If you are uncomfortable doing so, speak with one of the other State Managers or directly with Adam Cogan.
* **Confidential Handling:** Any concerns raised will be dealt with in confidence. If the issue is not resolved, re-raise your concerns with another State Manager.
* **Document Decisions:** If a decision doesn't go your way, send a "for the record" email to confirm.

### Emergency Procedures

#### Fire Procedures

In the event of a fire:

* **Critical Fire:** Evacuate the building, call 000, and identify the building.
* **Non-critical Fire:** Use a fire blanket for electrical fires or a fire extinguisher for non-electrical fires, if safe to do so, and call 000.

#### Health and Medical Conditions

Inform SSW of any medical conditions, illnesses, or diseases to protect other staff. Provide a current medical certificate if applicable.

### COVID-19/Coronavirus Workplace Practices

Follow local and state government COVID-19 safety recommendations. Inform SSW and colleagues if you test positive for COVID-19 and follow isolation guidelines.

### Smoking and Drinking Policies

* **No Smoking:** Smoking is not permitted in SSW offices/cars or client's offices/cars.
* **No Drinking:** No drinking during the day and no drinking at SSW events.

### Discrimination

SSW does not tolerate discrimination based on race, religion, gender, disability, marital status, sexual orientation, national origin, or age.

### First Aid

Know the location of the first aid kit in your office. For example:

* Sydney: Near "The Engine," outside the "GitHub" toilets.
* Brisbane: In the kitchen to the left of the fridge.
* Melbourne: In the equipment drawers next to the kitchen.
* Newcastle: In the large cupboard to the right of the fire escape.
