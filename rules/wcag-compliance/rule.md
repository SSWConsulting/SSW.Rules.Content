The internet has become a part of daily life, but not everyone uses it in the same way.
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are a set of formal standards aimed to address this problem.
Conform to WCAG and make your website accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities or the way they navigate it.

## The 4 Principles (P.O.U.R.)

WCAG consists of 4 high-level principles. Each principle is broken down into a number of sub-criteria.

### 1: Perceivable

* Text Alternatives (1.1): Provide text alternatives for non-text content.
* Time-based Media (1.2): Provide alternatives and captions for multimedia content.
* Adaptable (1.3): Present content in different ways without losing information or structure.
* Distinguishable (1.4): Ensure content is readable, with sufficient color contrast and text sizing options.

### 2: Operable

* Keyboard Accessible (2.1): Ensure all functionality can be operated via a keyboard.
* Enough Time (2.2): Provide users enough time to read and complete tasks.
* Seizures and Physical Reactions (2.3): Do not design content that is known to cause seizures or physical discomfort.
* Navigable (2.4): Create a navigable and intuitive user interface.
* Input Modalities (2.5): Ensure compatibility with input methods beyond just a keyboard.

### 3: Understandable

* Readable (3.1): Make content readable and understandable.
* Predictable (3.2): Create a consistent and predictable UI.
* Input Assistance (3.3): Help users avoid and correct errors.

### 4: Robust

* Compatible (4.1): Optimize compatibility with current and future technologies.

## Key terms

The following are some key concepts that can help make WCAG easier to understand.

* **WCAG versioning:** The guidelines are updated at irregular intervals so it's important to be clear which version you're referencing.
E.g. [WCAG 2.2.](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22)
* **Conformance level:** The degree to which a website complies with WCAG.
Level A is must-have, AA is should-have (a common target), and AAA represents maximized accessibility.
* **Success Criteria:** Each WCAG principle contains sub-categories which themselves contain specific success criteria.
This means when you reference a success criterion it will have a number like "2.4.1: Bypass Blocks".
* **WAI-ARIA** (Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications):
A specification of semantic requirements for assistive technologies like screen readers.
