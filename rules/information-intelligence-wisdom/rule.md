It’s easy to capture lots of telemetry from your software; everything from exceptions to usage statistics. But do you know what to do with it and how to interpret what this data is telling you? That’s the difference between information, intelligence, and wisdom.

<!--endintro-->
 
Your data is a potentially valuable asset and it should be working hard for you.
 
### Level 1: Information
 
Information tells you what happened. Lots of data is available and its easy to record it all now in a service like App Insights, but at this point it’s only information and you need to turn it into something useful for it to have value.
 
### Level 2: Intelligence
 
Intelligence tells you why something happened. Having lots of data is awesome, but you should be able to draw meaningful interpretations from that data, or better yet, as your data grows and you know how to recognise patterns in it, have your system draw these automatically and raise alerts about important events.
 
### Level 3: Wisdom
 
Wisdom tells you what you should do next. The information and intelligence that you are gathering should be usable to make informed decisions about how you should manage your system or business. A good business intelligence system should provide actionable recommendations rather than simply providing information and explanations.

**Note:** Your business intelligence system could be automated (awesome) but could also be a combination of automated reporting technology as well as human review processes (not as cool, but still better than not interpreting your data).

### Examples
 
| Information | Intelligence | Wisdom |
|--|--|--|
| Our app service goes offline every day at 3am | Increased demand between 2am, and 4am often pushes the system beyond peak capacity | Automate your infrastructure to scale out on a schedule to meet increased demand |
| We got 30% fewer clicks from our social media advertising in July than we did in June. | In July we diverted advertising budget away from social media platform A to social media platform B. Platform A generates more clicks than platform B | Should we focus all our advertising on platform A? No, because while platform B generates fewer clicks, it generates higher quality clicks (i.e. 70% higher conversions than platform A). | 
| What is this? It’s a hot dog. | Can I eat the hot dog? Yes. | Should I eat the hot dog? Probably not. |
