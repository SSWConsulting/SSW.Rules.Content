English can be really confusing sometimes, and it is often difficult to decipher someone's meaning without proper context. This problem is particularly notable when you are browsing a page on google, because you lack the context of the rest of the page. 

For example, a page might have a category on a website, but when you look at it in google that category is completely missing.

Prefixes are an awesome way to quickly establish context for readers. Here's some examples of how prefixes help:

![Bad Example - There is no context provided, it could be about subjects for Meetings, Conferences, Videos or something entirely different](badexamplenocontext.png)

![Okay Example - The context is included in the question](okayexamplehascontext.png)

![Good Example - The prefix very clearly identifies the subject](goodexamplehascontextviaprefix.png)
