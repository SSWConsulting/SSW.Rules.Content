English can be really confusing sometimes, and it is often difficult to decipher someone's meaning without proper context. This problem is particularly notable when you are browsing a page on google, because you lack the context of the rest of the page. 

For example, a page might have a category on a website, but when you look at it in google that category is completely missing.

At a bare minimum, the context should be completely fleshed out in the title of a page. However, the gold standard is to use prefixes.

Prefixes provide several benefits including:

<!--endintro-->

* Establishing context without having to read the content
* Priming the reader on the subject matter
* Helping the reader quickly jump to the right content in a list
* Categorizing content together without the need for a complex bespoke solution

![Bad Example - There is no context provided, it could be about subjects for Meetings, Conferences, Videos or something entirely different](badexamplenocontext.png)

::: ok
![OK Example - The context is included in the question](okayexamplehascontext.png)
:::

::: good
![Good Example - The prefix very clearly identifies the subject](goodexamplehascontextviaprefix.png)
