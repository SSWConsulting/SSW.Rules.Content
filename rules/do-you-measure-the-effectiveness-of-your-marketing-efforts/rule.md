<span class='intro'> <p>Management seem to have a huge focus on facts and figures and much like most other things in the business arena, in marketing you need to be able to put numbers to your results. You'll need to justify why you chose one option over another with a solid figure. Because there are a myriad of ways in which you can market your products/services there's a managerial expectation that you'll be able to reflect on its performance. </p> </span>

<p>​For example if you're coordinating some outbound calling, you need to make sure that all of the calls that are made are logged and you can query for closing rates. See our&#160;<a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulestoBetterOutboundCalls.aspx#Measure">outbound rules</a>​&#160;for more detail. In addition when you're measuring the effectiveness of your campaigns you need to know what marketing figures are considered a success for your different types of marketing campaigns. For example direct mail campaigns with a conversion rate of 2%-5% is considered a success due to the volume of people we contact.​</p>
