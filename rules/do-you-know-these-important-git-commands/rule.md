### Git Reset – Discard your local changes and revert to your last Commit

<!--endintro-->

![Figure: When trying to undo a change you will sometimes get errors. The answer is to exit Visual Studio and use the command line](git-reset-1.jpg)

**Note:** A common cause of Visual Studio failing to undo changes is an incomplete .gitignore file.
