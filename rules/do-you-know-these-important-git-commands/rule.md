### Git Reset – Discard your local changes and revert to your last Commit

<!--endintro-->

![Figure: When trying to undo a change you will sometimes get errors. The answer is to exit Visual Studio and use the command line](git-reset-1.jpg)  

![Figure: use ‘git reset --hard HEAD’ to throw away all your uncommitted changes](git-reset-2.jpg)  
**Note:** A common cause of Visual Studio failing to undo changes is an incomplete .gitignore file. See  http://adamstephensen.com/2014/05/13/update-your-gitignore/ for more information.
