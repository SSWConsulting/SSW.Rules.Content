<span class='intro'> Having many people in a company&#160;that are able to make schema changes, can only lead to big problems. This gets worse if the application is powerful (eg. enabled with <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/SSW/SQLDeploy/">SSW SQL Deploy</a> that can make schema changes itself) can make schema changes. <br>
<br>
Let's see&#160;how to fix&#160;the issue&#58; 
 </span>

To avoid this problem, only one person (the &quot;Schema Master&quot;) should have permissions to upgrade the database.
