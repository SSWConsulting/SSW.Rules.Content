When quoting prices, it's common practice to state the monthly cost. However, it's crucial to provide a full picture by also including the annual cost. The reasons:

- **Annual Budget Planning**: It helps individuals and businesses in planning their annual budgets.
- **Comparison Ease**: Customers can more easily compare costs with other services or products.
- **Long-term Perspective**: It encourages customers to think about long-term costs and benefits, rather than just immediate expenses.
