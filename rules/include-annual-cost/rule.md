When quoting prices, it's common practice to state daily, weekly, or monthly costs; sometimes per person, per click, etc. It's crucial to provide a full picture by also including the annual cost. The reasons:

- **Annual Budget Planning**: It helps individuals and businesses in planning their annual budgets
- **Comparison Ease**: Customers can more easily compare costs with other services or products
- **Long-term Perspective**: It encourages customers to think about long-term costs and benefits, rather than just immediate expenses
