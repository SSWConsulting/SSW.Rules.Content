<p>When a colleague or a client asks you to do a task verbally, or you have discovered there’s a task you need to do but don’t have time to do it immediately,&#160;what method do you have for remembering to do it?<br></p><p>The best solution is to send yourself an email CC'ing the person who asked you, including &quot;<a id="AsPerConversationEmail" href="/Pages/DoYouAlwaysSendAnAsPerOurConversationEmail.aspx" target="_blank" shape="rect">As per our conversation</a>...&quot; This way both of you know that the job needs to be done. This is really important especially when you are working for clients so there is a record of the requests for work.<br></p>

<p>Always add &quot;To myself&quot; in the email body - not on the subject - so that other people CC'd know what is going on. <br></p><div class="greyBox"><p>
