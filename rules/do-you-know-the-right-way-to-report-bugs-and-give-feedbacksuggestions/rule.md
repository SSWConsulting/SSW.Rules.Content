<span class='intro'> <p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​​​​​​​When reporting bugs and giving product feedback, it is essential that you are as descriptive as possible, so that the developer can reproduce the error to find out what the problem is&#160;or understand what features you are requesting.<br></p><div><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Try to have one email per bug​/suggestion, but if the bugs/suggestions&#160;are related or very small&#160;(e.g. they are all on the same page) then you should group them&#160;together in a single email.​<br></p></div> </span>
