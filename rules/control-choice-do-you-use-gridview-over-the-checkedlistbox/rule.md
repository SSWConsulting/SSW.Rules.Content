In Web we have:


* Grids E.g. http://demos.kendoui.com/web/grid/selection.html 


In Windows Forms we have a CheckedListBox. With a CheckedListBox you cannot:

* Sort data - always useful when there are more than about 20 rows
* Contain much information - can only show one field
* DataBind - always costs heaps of code

In Windows Forms, the code of DataGrid databinding is easier than that of CheckedListBox.

ProductsService.Instance.GetAll(Me.ProductsDataSet1)
CheckedListBox1.DataSource = Me.ProductsDataSet1.Tables(0)
CheckedListBox1.ValueMember = "ProductID"
CheckedListBox1.DisplayMember = "ProductName"
For i As Integer = 0 To CheckedListBox1.Items.Count - 1
Dim checked As Boolean = CType(ProductsDataSet1.Tables(0).Rows(i)("Discontinued"), Boolean)
CheckedListBox1.SetItemChecked(i,checked)
Next
Figure: 8 lines of code to fill a CheckedListBox
ProductsService.Instance.GetAll(Me.ProductsDataSet1)
Figure: One line of code to fill a DataGrid
But the CheckedListBox is useful if only one field needs displaying.
