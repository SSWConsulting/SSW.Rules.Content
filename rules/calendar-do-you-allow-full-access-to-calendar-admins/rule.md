Within a company, there are occasions that you are not able to access your computer to send sick emails, or you get a call from your client on the way to the office that you have to drive to a client site straight away; when such things happen, you need someone else to update your calendar when you call in, so others are aware of your availabilities.

So always make sure the admin people are able to access your calendar with full permission in order to add/edit/delete appointments for you.

Once the permission is given, open other people's calendar is as easy as 2 steps:

1. Go to the Calendar tab in outlook and click "open a Shared Calendar"

2. Choose the calendar you want to open in the pop-up form

Then you can have this shared calendar shown in your Outlook.
