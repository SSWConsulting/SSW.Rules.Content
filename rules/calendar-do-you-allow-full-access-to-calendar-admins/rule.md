<p>​There are occasions that you are not able to access your computer to send sick emails, or you get a call from your client on the way to the office that you have to drive to client site straight away; when such things happen, you need someone else to update your calendar when you call in, so others are aware of your availabilities. </p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>So always make sure the admin people are able to access your calendar with full permission in order to add/edit/delete appointments for you. ​</p>
                
                <dl class="image">
                    <dt><img src="/PublishingImages/CalendarPermissions.jpg" alt="Click on Calendar Permissions" style="width&#58;550px;" /></dt>
                    <dd>Figure&#58; Click on &quot;Calendar Permissions&quot;</dd>
                </dl>
                <dl class="image">
                    <dt><img src="/PublishingImages/CalendarProperties.jpg" alt="Set full access to admins" /></dt>
                    <dd>Figure&#58; Give admins full access to your calendar</dd>
                </dl>
               <p>Once the permission is given, open other people's calendar is as easy as 2 steps&#58;
               </p>
               <ol>
                   <li>Go to the Calendar tab in outlook and click &quot;open a Shared Calendar&quot;
                         <dl class="image">
                        <dt>
                            <img src="/PublishingImages/OpenSharedCalendar.jpg" alt="Open a Shared Calendar" />
                        </dt>
                        <dd>Figure&#58; Opening a shared calendar</dd>
                        </dl>
                   </li>
                   <li>Choose the calendar you want to open in the pop up form&#58;
                       <dl class="image">
                        <dt>
                            <img src="/PublishingImages/SharedCalendar.jpg" alt="Choose the calendar you want to open" />
                        </dt>
                        <dd>Figure&#58; Find the calendar you want</dd>
                        </dl>
                        Then you can have this shared calendar shown in your Outlook.
                   </li>
               </ol>
