<span class='intro'> <p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">in the Chat section,&#160;w​ith the&#160;Visitors&#160;activity, you can see&#160;is a real-time list of all the visitors currently on your website. It helps summarize all visitor information at a glance, including information about their browser, operating system, location, pages visited, and referral page.&#160;<br></p> </span>

<p>
   <strong>Monitoring your website visitors </strong></p><p>The Visitors activity gives you&#160;a birds-eye view of all the visitors on your website by putting them into different categories&#58; 
   </p><dl class="image"><dt><img src="zendesk-visitors-1.png" alt="zendesk-visitors-1.png" /></dt></dl><ul><li>
      <strong>Incoming Chats&#58;&#160;</strong>Visitors who have clicked the chat button and asked a question.</li><li>
      <strong>Chat Button Clicked&#58;&#160;</strong>Visitors who have clicked the chat button but have yet to start a chat.</li><li>
      <strong>Trigger&#160;Activated&#58;&#160;</strong>Visitors who have&#160;activated a trigger.</li><li>
      <strong>Currently Served&#58;&#160;</strong>Visitors&#160;who are being currently served by other agents or yourself.</li><li>
      <strong>Active Visitors&#58;&#160;</strong>Visitors&#160;who are moving around the website and clicking on links.&#160; 
      <br></li></ul><p>Click the&#160;<strong>List&#160;</strong>tab<strong>&#160;</strong>to view visitors in a list, as shown above, or click&#160;<strong>Visual</strong>&#160;to see visitors in visual mode.​<br><br></p><p>
   <strong>Grouping visitors </strong></p><p>This is the primary view of the Visitor List, but you can also monitor them in a number of different ways&#58;</p><dl class="image"><dt><img src="zendesk-visitors-2.png" alt="zendesk-visitors-2.png" />
   </dt></dl><ul><li>
      <strong>Activity&#58;</strong>&#160;This is the default page and breaks down visitors based on the actions they have taken on your website.</li><li>
      <strong>Page Title&#58;</strong>&#160;Groups visitors based on the page they are on.</li><li>
      <strong>Page URL&#58;</strong>&#160;Groups visitors&#160;based on the URL/link they are on. This is normally different from the Page Title.</li><li>
      <strong>Country&#58;</strong>&#160;Groups visitors&#160;based on the country they are from. The visitor's IP address tells us which country they are from.</li><li>
      <strong>Serving Agent&#58;</strong>&#160;Groups visitors&#160;based on the agent who is serving them.</li><li>
      <strong>Department&#58;&#160;</strong>Groups visitors based on department.<br></li><li>
      <strong>Browser&#58;</strong>&#160;Groups visitors&#160;based on the browser they are using to access your website.</li><li>
      <strong>Search Engine&#58;</strong>&#160;If the visitors arrived at your website through a search engine (e.g. Google), they will be grouped under this category.</li><li>
      <strong>Search Term&#58;&#160;</strong>If the visitors typed in a search term to get to your website, they will be grouped in this section based on the term they used. 
      <br></li></ul><p>
   <strong>Using the High Load Dashboard (Premium)</strong></p><p>If you experience higher traffic (5000 or more concurrent visitors), you can switch to the High Load Dashboard. 
   <br></p><p>Unlike the standard Visitor List, the High Load Dashboard&#160;only shows Incoming and Currently Served chats.&#160;<br><br></p><p>
   <strong>To enable the High Load Dashboard</strong></p><ol><li>From the dashboard, go to&#160;<strong>Settings&#160;</strong>&gt;&#160;<strong>Account</strong>&#160;&gt;&#160;<strong>Visitor List&#160;</strong>tab.</li><li>Select the&#160;<strong>High Load Dashboard&#160;</strong>check box.&#160;
