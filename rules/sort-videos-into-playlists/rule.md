All your videos should be inserted into playlists and these playlists should be shown and promoted on your channel. Let's see why.<br>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>Creating and promoting optimized playlists is a plus, increasing session time (amount of time spent by a person on YouTube after watching your video). YouTube wants people to spend more time on their website (to increase their revenue with ads) so if a channel makes people spend more time on YouTube, this channel gets a boost. YouTube will automatically launch another video from a playlist once the first video is over, increasing session time. This snowball effect will give your channel and videos a great boost!</p><p><br></p><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><img src="playlist_bad.png" alt="" style="margin:5px;width:808px;" /> </dl><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad">Bad example: people living YouTube after (or even while) watching one of your videos will rank you (and your content) down.</dd><p><br></p><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><img src="playlist_ok.png" alt="" style="margin:5px;width:808px;" /> </dl><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">OK example: people watching another video after yours will give you a little boost.</dd><p><br></p><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><img src="playlist_good.png" alt="" style="margin:5px;width:808px;" /> </dl><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Good example: people watching a video from your playlist are more likely to keep watching more of your videos, giving you a big boost!</dd><p><br></p><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><img src="playlist_good_sswtv.png" alt="" style="margin:5px;width:808px;" /> </dl><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Good example: make sure that every video is in at least one playlist.</dd><dt><br></dt><dt><strong>Images</strong>: courtesy of Brian Dean (<a href="https://backlinko.com/grow-youtube-channel">source</a>).<br></dt>
