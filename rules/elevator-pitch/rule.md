The first impression given to a prospective client or employee is essential to forming their image of a company. A bad impression means they are unlikely to work with the company.

## The scenario

Consider the situation where you jump in an elevator with 1 other person and they ask **"what does your company do?"**

There is probably under 60 seconds to give an answer that will excite them about the prospect of working with the company.

This conversation is called the elevator pitch, and knowing how to do it is crucial to generating successful leads.

This concept is particularly crucial for client facing employees, but is also important for others at the company because they are acting as ambassadors whenever they are out in the world.

## How to form an elevator pitch

To form an elevator pitch, it is important to collate your thoughts about the ethos of the company.

### The What

Think about what your company does and for who, what problems do they solve?

For example, we build custom software for a range of industries such as healthcare, insurance and government.

### The Unique Value

Now think about the unique value the company delivers to clients and note it down too.

For example it might be a team of experts making solutions that:

* Are built with Microsoft technologies
* Use best practices
* Are efficient

### The Where

Finally, where do you do business?

For example, the company might have offices in:

* Sydney
* Melbourne
* Brisbane
* Newcastle
* Hangzhou

### The Execution

Now you have a few bullet points, go outside and record a quick video from memory. Here's a few tips to get it right:

* Hook people in - Make sure to mention the question at the start so people have a little context.
* Perfect it - Do a few takes until it feels right

There you go, that's your elevator pitch!
