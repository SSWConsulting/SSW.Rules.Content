The first impression given to a prospective client or employee is essential to forming their image of a company. A bad impression means they are unlikely to work with the company.

## The scenario
Consider the situation where you jump in an elevator with 1 other person and they ask **"what does your company do?"**

There is probably under 60 seconds to give an answer that will excite them about the prospect of working with the company.

<!--endintro-->

This conversation is called the elevator pitch, and knowing how to do it is crucial to generating successful leads.

This concept is particularly crucial for client facing employees, but is important for all employee at the company because they are acting as ambassadors whenever they are out in the world. 

## How to form an elevator pitch
To form an elevator pitch, it is important to collate your thoughts about the ethos of the company.

### The Beliefs
Think about what are the core beliefs at the company and note them down as bullet points.

For example, that might be:
* Mastery
* Purpose
* Team-Aligned Autonomy

### The Value
Now think about the value the company delivers to the clients and note that down too.

For example that might be making solutions that:
* Are efficient
* Use best practices

### The Execution
Now you have a few bullet points, go outside and record a quick video from your memory. Make sure to mention the question at the start so people have a little context.

Take a few takes until it feels right and there you go, that's your elevator pitch!

Let's take a look at some examples of an SSW elevator pitch:
