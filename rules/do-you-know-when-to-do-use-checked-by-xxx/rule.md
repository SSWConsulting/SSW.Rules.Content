​There are times you should have your email checked by someone else before sending. Examples are&#58;<br>

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<ul>
    <li>Where you are a little unsure</li>
    <li>When you are new to a company and sending an email to a large distribution list</li>
    <li>Sending a complicated email</li>
    <li>Sending a sensitive email (where the content could be perceived as confrontational)</li><li>In application development,&#160;when you need a quick '<a href="/do-you-conduct-a-＂test-please＂-internally-and-then-with-the-client">test please</a>',&#160;an​d the person is immediately&#160;available. This​ provides you a chance to check and collaborate on the finished change before the '<a href="/Pages/Done-GiveDetailsAndDelete.aspx">done&#160;email</a>'&#160;is sent</li>
</ul>
<p>Doing this will ensure&#58;​</p>
<ul>
    <li>You avoid grammatical and spelling errors </li>
    <li>The layout and tone of the email is professional </li>
    <li>You haven’t forgotten anything important </li>
    <li>The receiver knows who else agrees with the content </li>
