<p>We have three types of VM images around the office. </p>
<ol><li>The master.vhd is for upgrading future VMs and sysprep VM's are built from the master.vhd<br>The <b>master.vhd is versioned (e.g. master_v8.vhd)</b> to track which version it is, and to assist us in upgrading the master image. 
</li>
<li>The sysprep.vhd is the one that we use to create a new SharePoint server <br>When you run the sysprep.vhd it will create a new SharePoint server. Always make a copy of this to your own machine. The <b>sysprep.vhd is versioned (e.g. sysprep_v8.vhd)</b> 
</li>
<li>You may find various other VM's created from sysprep.vhd and used for various projects or experiments<br>These images are usually renamed but kept the original version number that it was created from. (e.g. sswsp_v8.vhd)</li></ol>
