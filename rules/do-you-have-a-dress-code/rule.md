<p>​​The way you and all members of your team present themselves is a crucial part of
                    creating a good impression for your clients, particularly in their first encounters
                    with you.

<h3>Dressing Up</h3><p>One aspect of this is dress code. Dress code is important for two reasons&#58;</p><ul><li>Looking professional and keen for business<br></li><li>Reinforce&#160;the company's&#160;<a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterBranding.aspx#BrandingEmployees">branding</a></li></ul><p>
   <span style="line-height&#58;1.6;"> <span style="line-height&#58;20.8px;">E.g. At SSW, our&#160;employees</span>&#160;</span><span style="line-height&#58;1.6;"><b>&quot;Dress Up&quot;&#160;on Mondays and Tuesdays by wearing company colors</b>,<b></b></span><span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">&#160;with a nice shirt (business or polo), trousers (not blue jeans), belt,&#160;nice&#160;shoes (no sneakers, joggers or thongs). So most employees wear their SSW shirts on Mondays. </span> <br></p><h3>The Obvious</h3><p>Of course when&#160;in a&#160;public event&#160;such as a User Group, conference&#160;or seeing clients you should &quot;Dress Up&quot;. <br></p><p>It should go without saying, but of course, things such as&#160;shaving off your weekend facial growth, using deodorant and having clean teeth and nice breath is assumed.</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-Reference">&quot;There is nothing wrong with being the best-dressed man in the room.&quot;</p>-&#160;<strong>Sean Connery</strong> <br>

<h3>On a business flight<br></h3>It's a good idea to&#160;&quot;Dress Up&quot; in flights as you never know who you will be seated next to.<dl class="image"><dt> <img src="/PublishingImages/dresscode-linkedin.PNG" alt="dresscode-linkedin.PNG" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Why dress up in a flight<br></dd></dl><h3>Dressing Down (aka Casual Fridays)</h3><p>Many companies find it a good idea to have Casual Fridays. It is free and easy to do and gives the team something to look forward to.</p><p>E.g. At SSW, our&#160;employees <strong>&quot;Dress Down&quot;&#160;later in the week... so they have &quot;Casual Thursday&quot; and &quot;Sporty Friday&quot;</strong>.</p><p>Thursday are casual clothes. On Fridays, they encourage sport clo thes, such as shorts. It allows the end of the week to be fun.</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">​<img alt="SSW_Dresscode_Poster.png" src="/PublishingImages/SSW_Dresscode_Poster.png" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;650px;" /></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; <a href="https&#58;//www.dropbox.com/s/0sj1xn7av6sfz6w/SSW_Dresscode_Poster_A3.pdf?dl=0">SSW Dress Code can be downloaded here</a>.<br></dd>
