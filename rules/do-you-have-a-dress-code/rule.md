It is free and easy to do and gives the team something to look forward to.</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">E.g. At SSW, our&#160;employees&#160;<b>&quot;Dress Up&quot;</b>&#160;on Mondays and Tuesdays by wearing company colors,&#160;with a nice shirt (business or polo), trousers (not blue jeans), belt,&#160;nice&#160;shoes (no sneakers, joggers or thongs). So most employees wear their SSW shirts on Mondays.<br>Then they&#160;<b>&quot;Dress Down&quot;</b>&#160;later in the week... so they have 
   <b>&quot;Casual Thursday&quot;</b> and 
   <b>&quot;Sporty Friday&quot;</b>.<br></p><p>Thursday are casual clothes. On Fridays, they encourage sport clothes, such as shorts. It allows the end of the week to be fun.</p><dl class="image"><dt>​<img alt="SSW_Dresscode_Poster.png" src="/PublishingImages/SSW_Dresscode_Poster.png" style="width&#58;750px;" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; ​<a href="https&#58;//sswcom.sharepoint.com/&#58;b&#58;/s/SSWDESIGN/EfVEIVvnUK5EoEE22SnqtskBlSE3nryQTkLDTjsfGrTV-Q?e=XijWyg">SSW Dress Code can be downloaded here&#160;(internal only)</a>​​<br></dd></dl><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Shorts Days - the cool exception<br></h3><p>On very hot days, shorts are allowed as soon as you've got an email like this&#58;​<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox"><b>Subject&#58; SSW Sydney - &#129651; Shorts Today!
