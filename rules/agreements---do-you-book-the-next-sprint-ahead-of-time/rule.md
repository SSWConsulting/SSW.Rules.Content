Most people don’t manage their inbox effectively. Emails should be treated as a list to do. As you complete a task you can just delete the email.

Your inbox should only contain 'tasks', that are actionable items on your list of things to do . Everything that is in your 'Inbox' (including sub-folders) should only be to-do items.

So do it now, delete all emails you have done. If you want to keep some for reference, move them to a new folder that is not in your inbox.

The best tool for use in medium to large organizations is Azure API Management. It has all the features other API Management tools have. It also provides an API gateway for simplifying hosting your APIs. This gateway allows easy handling of all sorts of use cases. Things like rate limiting, consistent authentication, firewalls and code first APIs are supported easily. This is all as well as providing API documentation to developers.

For smaller organizations one of the http://swagger.io products may suit better. They are free to start with until you start looking for more advanced features. The feature set even on the paid tiers is still significantly more limited than Azure API Management, however the cost is also much lower.

Unless we're currently working on the last sprint of the development, you should always book the next sprint as soon as you start work on the current one.

<!--endintro-->

This is done during the [planning meeting](/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/SprintPlanning%28WHAT%29Meeting.aspx)and will ensure the availability of the developers who are up to speed on your project and stop them from being booked onto something else.
