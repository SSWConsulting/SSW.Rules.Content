Unless we're currently working on the last sprint of the development, you should always book the next sprint as soon as you start work on the current one.

<p>​This is done during the <a href="/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/SprintPlanning(WHAT)Meeting.aspx">planning meeting </a>and&#160;will ensure the availability of the developers who are up to speed on your project and stop them from being booked onto something else.</p>
