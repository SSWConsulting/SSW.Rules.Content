<span class='intro'> <dl class="goodImage"><dt><img border="0" alt="Windows plays sounds for message boxes" src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/Win7SoundError.gif" /></dt>
<dd>Figure&#58; Good Example - Windows message boxes plays a sound... which cannot be captured in screenshot form.</dd></dl> </span>

â€‹<div>A message box automatically provides this functionality so there is no need to manually put a beep right before a message box pops up.</div>
<dl class="badCode"><dt><pre>        Dim Message As String = &quot;You did not enter a server name. Cancel this operation?&quot;
        Dim Caption As String = &quot;No Server Name Specified&quot;
        Dim Buttons As Integer = MessageBoxButtons.YesNo
        Beep()
        result = MessageBox.Show( Me, Message, Caption, Buttons)
                    </pre></dt>
<dd>Figure&#58; Bad example - The sound on the button is hardcoded in this code snippet</dd></dl>
<dl class="goodCode"><dt><pre>        Dim Message As String = &quot;You did not enter a server name. Cancel this operation?&quot;
        Dim Caption As String = &quot;No Server Name Specified&quot;
        Dim Buttons As Integer = MessageBoxButtons.YesNo
        result = MessageBox.Show( Me, Message, Caption, Buttons)
                    </pre></dt>
<dd>Figure&#58; The code is not present in this example as it is automatically done</dd></dl>
