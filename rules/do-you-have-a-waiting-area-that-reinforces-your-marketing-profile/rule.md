<span class='intro'> <div>We believe in reinforcing your company profile at every appropriate opportunity. The appearance of your office is very important because it is often the first impression of your company to any new visitor or client. In this way, its appearance is as important to your company profile as your clothing is to your personal profile. Although it may appear odd to cover yourself with marketing paraphernalia as you walk down the street, it's good business sense to use your office as one of your marketing tools.<br></div><br> </span>

For example, you can direct all of your visiting clients into your waiting area for a brief period, which contains useful information about your business, such as signs on the walls and/or a TV that scrolls through your most important features, like your team, current projects, upcoming events, the way you work, awards, and testimonials from your satisfied customers.<br><div><br></div><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><img src="MicrosoftTeams-image%20(1).png" alt="MicrosoftTeams-image (1).png" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;808px;" /><br></dl><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Good Example - Figure&#58;&#160;use your waiting area as an extension of your Marketing strategy<br></dd>
