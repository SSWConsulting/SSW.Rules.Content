When creating links, you should follow a few basic rules:

<!--endintro-->

1. If your link is an internal link, then it should navigate within the same window. If the link is external, it should open in a new tab and be visually clear to the user that it will lead them away from the current site, that way it is not a surprise.
2. If a link is to an external site, a 
       **visual indication** should be provided to the user like this: 
      [This is a link to another site](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Redirect/Microsoft/microsoft.htm). 
      

::: greybox
Search Engines (<a class="ignore" href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Redirect/Web/Google.htm" target="_blank">http&#58;//www.google.com</a> is by far the best but try other search engines as well)  
:::
<dd>Figure&#58; Bad example - Without visual indication</dd>

::: greybox
Search Engines (<a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Redirect/Web/Google.htm" target="_blank">http&#58;//www.google.com</a>&#160;is by far the best but try other search engines as well  
:::
<dd>Figure&#58; Good example - With visual indication
</dd>
3. External link 
       **external indicators should be inserted by CSS** as following: 
      
<pre>a[href*=&quot;//&quot;]&#58;not([href*=&quot;mysite.com&quot;])&#58;after &#123; 
            
&#160; &#160; content&#58; url(https&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/images/external.gif); 
            
&#160; &#160; padding-left&#58; 4px;
&#125;
</pre>
<dd>Figure&#58; Good example - Icon is added by CSS via a simple declaration
</dd>


We have a program called     [SSW Code Auditor](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/) to check for this rule.
