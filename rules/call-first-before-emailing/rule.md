To prevent downtime while waiting for a response from a client, or the topic in an email needs to be discussed immediately (e.g. a [bug](/fix-bugs-first)), you should always **call first** before emailing.

## ✅ Benefits of calling first

Calling first can save valuable time versus waiting for someone to respond to your email, making you more productive.

It also saves time when discussing topics that are [easier explained over the phone](/seek-clarification-via-phone).

When you need to contact someone, the steps you should take are:

1. If possible, ping them on IM asking "Can I talk to you"
2. Call them
3. If you do not get through, leave a [voice message](/do-you-use-voice-recordings-when-appropriate) and send an email starting with “As per the voicemail I left..."
4. After talking with the person, follow up with an email that [begins with the words "As per our conversation"](/as-per-our-conversation-emails)

It’s rare for a client to complain about being contacted too often. What they will notice is if you only ever email. Don’t be afraid to **call first before sending an email**.
