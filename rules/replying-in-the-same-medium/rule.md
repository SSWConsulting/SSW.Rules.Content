Consistency is key in communication. Always reply to tasks or questions in the same medium they were sent. It's all about showing courtesy, avoiding confusion, and keeping things running smoothly.

<!--endintro-->

When someone messages you on a specific platform, it's because they chose that medium for a reason. Keeping the conversation in one place makes it easier to refer back to previous messages and stay on the same page. It's a straightforward way to keep things clear and minimize hiccups.

So, next time you get an IM or an email, remember to reply in the same platform - it's a simple yet effective way to keep the conversation flowing smoothly.

::: info
**Tip:** When you receive a question on IM (direct chat or @mention in a group chat), make an effort to respond promptly, even if you don't have an immediate solution. Simply acknowledging the other person's concern goes a long way in maintaining effective communication.
:::

### Replying to multiple mediums

If someone chases you up on IM about an email... when you finish the task you should reply on **both** mediums.
E.g. "Done - see email"

### Replying with a PBI link

If someone sends an email that you [converted to a PBI](/turn-emails-into-work-items), you should reply to the email with the PBI link, so everyone knows where to follow up.
