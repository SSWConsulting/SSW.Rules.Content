Having a documented process for managing engagements provides clients with a consistent experience. It also helps to get new employees up to speed quickly, and provides a reference to existing employees to ensure no steps are accidentally missed. 

<!--endintro-->

Our engagement lifecycle overlaps with our [sales pipeline](/do-you-know-the-6-stages-in-the-sales-pipeline), and maps to the [8 Steps to Scrum](/do-you-know-the-8-steps-to-scrum).

:::

1. **Initial Phone Call**
    * The client has made contact but no initial meeting has yet been made
2. [Initial Meeting](/meetings-are-you-prepared-for-the-initial-meeting) - Booked
    * Sales team has arranged an initial meeting and it's booked in.
    * The Initial Meeting is a non-billed meeting that maps to the Initial Meeting described in the **8 Steps to Scrum**. It is attended by a Sales person and ideally a Solution Architect.
3. **Follow Up Meeting** - Booked
    * In some cases, more than one initial meeting may be required before work or speccing commences.
4. **[Specification Review](/rules-to-better-specification-reviews) Proposal** - Waiting for Approval
    * After the Initial Meeting, if the work requires it, a Specification Review is proposed.
5. **Specification Review** - Booked
    * The Specification Review meeting has been approved and booked in.
    * The Specification Review is a billed meeting with the customer to review existing specifications, understand specific goals, risks and relevant technologies appropriate for the solution, and create the initial backlog.
    * During the Specification Review, the Solution Architect prepares a document, presentation, or video outlining the results of the Specification Review, as per [Spec - Do you effectively present the outcomes at the "Specification Review presentation"?](/specification-review-presentation).
6. **Project Proposal** - Waiting for Approval
    * After the Specification Review, the client is given a proposal for a chunk of work. Once this is approved, the Sales Team closes the opportunity as 'won'.
    * Proposal is sent to the client including financials and the result of the Specification Review.
7. **Project Execution**
    * The Scrum process runs, starting with the first Sprint forecast email, as per [Do you create a Sprint Forecast? (aka The functionality that will be developed during the Sprint)](/do-you-create-a-sprint-forecast-aka-the-functionality-that-will-be-developed-during-the-sprint).
8. **Project Closure**
    * Project is completed, any handover or other transition that has been defined is completed with the client.
    * Just like a Sprint Retrospective is held at the end of each Sprint, a Project Retrospective is held to learn from the project that has just completed.
