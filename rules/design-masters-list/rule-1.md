Waiting for a designer to approve every UI change can block progress. But letting devs make visual tweaks unchecked often leads to messy, inconsistent designs.

<!--endintro-->

Create a “Design Masters” list – a small group of trusted designers and design-literate developers who can approve UI/UX changes when needed.

## Why it helps

* Speeds up decisions on small, non-controversial UI tweaks
* Reduces [design debt](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/design-debt/)
* Maintains visual consistency

## How to do it

* Designers are always the first choice
* Add devs who understand design and have done basic training (e.g. short video/course)
* Define what changes can be approved (e.g. padding, alignment) and what can’t (e.g. new components)
* Share the list with the team and review it regularly

Keep it tight, clear, and maintained – so you stay fast without sacrificing design quality.
