<p>
                    As a responsible employee, there should be no excuse for ever losing data, especially
                    if it belongs to a client. For this reason, it's important to make sure&#58;

<ul>
                    <li>Your <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/standards/rulestobetterdeadtime/images/developergeneral/windowstools.aspx#backup">backups </a>are working properly</li>
                    <li>You are using <a href="/ALM/RulesToBetterVersionControlwithTFS(AKASourceControl)/Pages/default.aspx">source control</a> for any code you develop</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If you are working onsite, you can still use TFS remotely and it's important to
                    talk the client into this in order to avoid any possible disasters.
