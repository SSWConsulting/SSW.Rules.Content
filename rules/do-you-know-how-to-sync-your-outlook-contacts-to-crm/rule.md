<p>
          It can be useful to have the contacts you deal with regularly in your O​​utlook (for
          offline access and easy editing).
        </p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>Contacts that you create or are assigned&#160;to you (that have not been deactivated)&#160;are your &quot;Active Contacts&quot;. 
   <span style="line-height&#58;20.799999237060547px;">By default, t</span>hese are the only ones that will sync from CRM to your Outlook. You can, however configure this to use any criteria you want to decide which contacts to sync.​</p><p> To do this, in Outlook, click File |&#160;CRM | Option​s | Synchronization, and click Outlook Filters. </p><p>​<br></p><dl class="image"><dt>

   <strong>You now know how to do this, although it is not recommended</strong></p><p>
   <span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">I</span><span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">f your Outlook syn</span><span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">cs to your mobile device, and you have a very large num</span><span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">ber of active contacts&#160;(say&#160;more than 1,000),&#160;it is not a&#160;scalable option to&#160;sync from&#160;CRM as&#58;&#160;</span></p><ul><li>
      <span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">​</span><span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">You may get too many contacts t​o easily deal with.&#160;</span><br></li><li>
      <span style="line-height&#58;20.799999237060547px;">Things like voice recognition (e.g. Siri or Cortana) will find more false positives.</span></li></ul><p>Similar issues happen when you sync all your Facebook contacts. You have too many, duplicates, and a new problem to manage.</p><p><br></p>
