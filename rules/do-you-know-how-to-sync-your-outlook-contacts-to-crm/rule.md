<p>
          It can be useful to have the contacts you deal with regularly in your outlook (for
          offline access and easy editing).
        </p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
 <p>
          Contacts that you create or have transferred to you are tagged as your &quot;Active contacts&quot;.
          These are the only ones that will sync from CRM to your Outlook.&#160;</p>
        <p>
          To do this, in Outlook, click File |&#160;CRM | Option​s | Synchronization, and click Outlook Filters.
        </p>

        <p>
          Remember, if your Outlook syncs to your mobile device, and you have a very large
          number of active contacts under your name, often it is not a scalable option to sync
          to CRM as you may get too many contacts to easily deal with.
        </p><p><span style="line-height&#58;20.799999237060547px;">In Outlook, you can also&#160;choose which of your personal contacts you want to sync to CRM by using the toolbar option &quot;Track&quot; and &quot;Set Parent&quot; (i.e. company).​</span><br></p>
