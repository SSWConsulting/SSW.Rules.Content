<p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">​&quot;​​Examples&#160;– When giving feedback, it’s often useful to use examples.&#160;Examples help make the feedback concrete.&#160;But, don’t allow the conversation to turn into a refutation of every example.&#160;I've been in conversations where the person I'm talking with wants to go through every example I have and explain why my interpretation is wrong.&#160;Be open to being wrong but don’t let it turn into point/counterpoint.&#160;Examples are only examples to support your feedback.​&quot;<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​When receiving&#160;a generic&#160;criticism, it's natural to sometimes ask for examples to help you understand what type of behaviour is being alluded to, but be careful to not then become defensive or&#160;fixated on justifying that instance.<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">If you feel you have some vital context to explain about that one example, make sure, as a minimum you end by ​saying &quot;<span class="ssw15-rteStyle-Highlight">...but I&#160;do take your point in general.</span>&quot;<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">Jane&#58; I feel like you never reply to my emails, but I see on emails I am cc'ed on you reply to emails from others.<br>Bob&#58; Really?

If you are also able to proactively suggest alternative behaviour for the future that would work for everyone, then you will build trust.&#160;<br></p><dl class="image"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/quality-communication-v2-500x500.jpg" alt="quality-communication-v2-500x500.jpg" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; It's important that the other persons knows they've been heard​<br></dd></dl>
