Whenever a Product Owner comes to you with a new request, it's important that you first acknowledge it (e.g. "That's a great idea!"), and then enquire about the new task's priority.

Most of the time, the Product Owner is happy to add the new request to the product's backlog. But every now and then, they are going to want to change your priorities and have you work on something which they see as more important than some of the items in your current Sprint. Provided that it doesn't have any negative effects overall, there isn't any reason why you can't stick to the "customer is always right" philosophy.

So what will you do when this happens?  

<!--endintro-->

1. Double check that this new item is more important than the current Sprint items (if not add it to the product backlog instead)
2. Add the new PBI to the current Sprint
3. Remove another item of similar size off the Sprint and back to the backlog

::: email-content  

### Hi {{ PRODUCT OWNER }},

As per our conversation, you have directed us to complete some urgent PBIs this Sprint in preparation for next week’s conference:

**Added:**

    {{ PBI URL }}

    {{ PBI URL }}

**Removed:**

    {{ PBI URL }}

Normally these PBIs would be prioritized for the next Sprint (see https://ssw.com.au/rules/unexpected-requests/), but we understand the time constraints for this work.

::: good
Figure: Good example - For urgent changes, you can substitute in some urgent PBIs as long as you stay within capacity. 
::: 

In the rare case where the entire sprint goal and all PBIs are no longer high priority, you can instead cancel the entire sprint and start again:

1. Move any left over work/items to the backlog.
2. Send a debrief to the client with a note e.g. As per your request we have just cancelled Sprint five and will start on Sprint six. The remaining items have been moved into the backlog.
3. Send a Sprint Forecast for the new sprint

This should only be done in extreme circumstances as it is traumatic to the team.
