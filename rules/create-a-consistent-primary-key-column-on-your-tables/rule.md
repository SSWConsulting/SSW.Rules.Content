Make sure you created a consistent primary key column named  **Id** on your tables.

<!--endintro-->



```
Employee.ID, Employee.EmployeeId, Employee.EmployeeID, Employee.Employee_Code, Employee.Employee
```




::: bad
Figure: Bad Example

:::



```
Employee.Id
```




::: good
Figure: Good Example

:::

### Why?




* We shouldnâ€™t capitalise ID (identifier) as it is an abbreviation not an acronym.
* Using the approach [TableName]Id, e.g. EmployeeId, is redundant as we already know the context of the Id.
