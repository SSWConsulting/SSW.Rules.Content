Make sure you created a consistent primary key column named **Id** on your tables.

<!--endintro-->

```sql
Employee.ID, Employee.EmployeeId, Employee.EmployeeID, Employee.Employee_Code, Employee.Employee
```

```sql
Employee.Id
```

### Why?

- We shouldnâ€™t capitalise ID (identifier) as it is an abbreviation not an acronym.
- Using the approach \[TableName\]Id, e.g. EmployeeId, is redundant as we already know the context of the Id.
