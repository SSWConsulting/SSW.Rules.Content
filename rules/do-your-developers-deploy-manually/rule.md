<span class='intro'> ​We strongly believe that this process should all be automated and painless. Even the receptionist should be able to make a grammatical change on the website and be able to deploy it.<p>We use TFS gated check-ins to do the deployment for us. When a developer checks there changes into TFS they are prompted with a gated check-in screen.</p>
<img class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" alt="Build screen" src="deployment1.jpg" /><span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; &quot;Build&quot; screen</span><br><p>The developer clicks the &quot;Build changes&quot; button and waits for the build to complete. This process needs to take no longer than 2 minutes as it just makes cranky developers if this takes too long.<br>The code is put into a TFS shelf, compiled, had all the unit tests run against the code and then deployed to the internal webserver if successful.</p>
<p>Once this process has completed successfully, the developer will get presented with the ability to &quot;reconcile&quot; their local copy of the files as they have now been successfully checked-in to TFS.</p>
<img class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" alt="Build screen" src="deployment2.jpg" /><span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; Click on the &quot;Reconcile&quot; button to update your local files</span><br><p>If the developer does not have Build notifications on there local computer then this step can also be easily performed via the Build Explorer in Visual Studio.</p>
<img class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" alt="Build screen" src="deployment3.jpg" /><span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; Right click on your last successful build and choose &quot;Reconcile Workspace&quot;</span><br><p>The <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/">www.ssw.com.au</a> website&#160;also queues a build process that deploys the changes to our Australian staging server. A developer can then use <a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=580a6735-c102-48c2-bf22-91ff3cc9ead5">Octopus deploy​</a> to push it live to our Australian and US production sites.<br></p>
<p>The process that syncs to our external servers is very quick. Only the changes in TFS since the last deployment are sent. This typically takes under 10 seconds to complete.<br></p>
<p>​If the build fails then no changes would get pushed to staging and developers should <a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=aea8bbdc-6efd-413a-b988-1c348dd77eb4">swarm to fix the build</a>.<br></p><p><img src="2017-04-11_10-13-08.png" alt="2017-04-11_10-13-08.png" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;808px;" /><br></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureNormal">​​Figure&#58; See the build failing and who requested it<br></dd><p><br><br></p> </span>
