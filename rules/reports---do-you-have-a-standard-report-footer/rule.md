<p>When designing custom applications you want to include branding on reports. 
                    There are two ways to design a standard footer. As a minimum, you can have a 
                    line &quot;Generated from [e.g.] SSW SQL Deploy - www.ssw.com.au&quot;.</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>Or, even better, you can send or keep detailed information about the report for you and your company&#58;</p><dl class="image"><dt> 
      <img src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/BetterInterface_ReportFooter.jpg" alt="ssw Report Footer" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;650px;" />
   </dt></dl><p class="productBox"> For more details about how to generate a footer like this, check our
