Employees with a compromised account should **immediately** contact their SysAdmins for help. This is whether it is a personal or a work account.

A personal account (e.g. Gmail) breach should be resolved by a System Administrator with the same priority as a work account. 
Employees should expect the same level of service on a personal breach as you would on a corporate breach.

Why? If your Gmail has been hacked this can have implications for the company.

Once you have informed your Systems Administrator of a potential breach send an "As Per My Conversation" email - https://ssw.com.au/rules/as-per-our-conversation-emails
