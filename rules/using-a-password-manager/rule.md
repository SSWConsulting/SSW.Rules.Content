The best passwords in the world are the ones you can never possibly remember. Computer generated passwords, with a length of at least 16 characters, offer the most protection. These passwords look something like this:

::: greybox
**$Jun!ZW@gYS%4hYj**
:::
::: good
Good example - a computer generated password people won't remember

This is obviously not something you can realistically type in every time you need to use it. Fortunately, the same tools that generate these for us also manage them, storing them securely and automatically entering them into websites and apps for us.

Some popular options include:

* 1Password
* LastPass
* Bitwarden
* KeePass

They each have their pros and cons and you should investigate them each thoroughly and decide which is the best one for you.
