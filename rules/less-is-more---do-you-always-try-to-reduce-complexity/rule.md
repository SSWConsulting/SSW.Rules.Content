<span class='intro'> <div>The human brain&#58;</div>
<ol><li>Never searches for OR compares all options</li>
<li>Prefers smaller sets of options (4 or less)</li>
<li>Picks the first option that looks good enough</li>
<li>Prefers a shorter option to a longer one</li>
<li>Makes a compromise between speed and accuracy</li></ol> </span>

â€‹<div>It's important to keep these in mind when making design decisions or presenting data.</div>
<div>Our visual short term memory has a capacity of 4 items. So options are easier for our brain to digest when presented in sets of 4.</div>
