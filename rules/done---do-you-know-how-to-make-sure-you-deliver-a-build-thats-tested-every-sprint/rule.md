<span class='intro'> 
  <p>&#160;What happens when you leave all the testing to the end of the sprint? You find things that are not <b><i>done</i></b> and you have no time before the <b>Sprint Review</b> to fix them. 
</p>

<p>It is preferable to conduct a <b>Smoke Test </b>to make sure that you are comfortable demoing the unit of work you just finished to the customer. One way to do this is to create a Coded UI test for each of the Stories as part of your Definition of Done (DoD) that runs through the functionality you have built. </p>
<p>In this scenario the “<b>test please</b>” with the customer happens outside of the current Sprint.&#160;<br>

<font class="ms-rteCustom-FigureGood" size="+0"><b>Figure&#58; Good example – Create a coded UI test for each story to prove that it is complete</b> </font></p>
<p>If you are doing <b>Scrum</b> then you should have a <b>User Story</b> fleshed out with a set of <b>Acceptance Criteria</b>. These <b>Acceptance Criteria</b> are agreed with the <b>Product Owner</b> before <b>The Team</b> committed to the story, and define what the <b>Product Owner</b> will accept as complete. This makes it relatively easy to create some automated tests that test for these <b>Acceptance Criteria</b> and help your <b>Sprint Review</b> go as smoothly as possible. </p>
<p>Any changes found during <b>the Sprint Review</b> get added to the <b>Product Backlog</b> to be prioritised by the <b>Product Owner</b>.&#160;<br>
