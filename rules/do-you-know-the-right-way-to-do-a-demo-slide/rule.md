<span class='intro'> By placing a little visual cue on your slide, you can remind yourself to show a demo to the audience. Avoid displaying the word 'demo', because when out of time, presenters skip them and leave the audience felling ripped off. 
 </span>


  <p>The icon allows you to skip it when running short on time, without upsetting the audience.</p>

    <dd class="ms-rteCustom-FigureBad">Figure&#58; Bad example - demo text shown. The problem is if you run out of time you need to say &quot;Sorry, let's skip that demo since I am short of time&quot;. Then the audience feels cheated</dd>
