By placing a little visual cue on your slide, you can remind yourself to show a demo to the audience. Avoid displaying the word 'demo', because when out of time, presenters skip them and leave the audience felling ripped off.

The icon allows you to skip it when running short on time, without upsetting the audience.
<dl>    &lt;dt&gt;<img class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" src="DemoBad.gif" alt=""> &lt;/dt&gt;
    <br><br>::: bad<br>Figure: Bad example - demo text shown. The problem is if you run out of time you need to say "Sorry, let's skip that demo since I am short of time". Then the audience feels cheated<br>:::<br><br></dl><dl>    &lt;dt&gt;<img class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" src="demo.gif" alt=""> &lt;/dt&gt;
