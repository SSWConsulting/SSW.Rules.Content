<span class='intro'> <p>The built-in CRM report wizard is great for users to quickly and easily create reports in CRM.</p>
<dl class="image"><dt><img src="custom-reports-1.jpg" alt="" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; The starting point</dd></dl> </span>

<p>But when the user wants to create a report that needs additional totals, different formatting, summaries in the header etc. A custom report is required.</p><p>Do you use Filtered Views or Fetch?</p><p><a href="http&#58;//msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg309722.aspx">Filtered Views</a>&#160;allows the report developer to query underlying SQL data directly. Filtered views are fully compliant with the Microsoft Dynamics CRM security model. When you run a report that obtains data from filtered views, the Microsoft Dynamics CRM security role determines what data you can view in the report.</p><dl class="image"><dt><img src="custom-reports-2.jpg" alt="" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Filtered Views in the CRM SQL Database</dd></dl><p><a href="http&#58;//technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb928434.aspx">Fetch</a>&#160;is a proprietary query language that is used in Microsoft Dynamics CRM. It is based on a schema that describes the capabilities of the language. The FetchXML language supports similar query capabilities as query expression. It is used primarily as a serialized form of query expression, used to save a query as a user owned saved view in the userquery entity or as an organization owned view in the savedquery entity.</p><p>Now with that out of the way which one do I use?</p><ol><li>If you’re using CRM Online then you have no choice, you will use Fetch as CRM Online does not allow access to the underlying CRM SQL Database.</li><li><strong>If you are using On-Premise CRM and are *unlikely* to ever migrate to CRM Online then Filtered Views is the right choice.</strong></li><li>If you are using On-Premise CRM and there is *<strong>any*</strong>&#160;chance of moving the CRM Online then use Fetch (otherwise your custom reports will need to be re-written to use Fetch).</li></ol><p>Fetch Restrictions&#58;</p><ul class="ul1"><li>
      Fetch does not support RIGHT OUTER JOIN and FULL OUTER JOIN.</li><li>
      Fetch does not support EXISTS/IN condition with sub-query/expression.</li><li>
      <strong>An amount of 5000 returned records maximum.</strong></li><li>
      No “UNION” selects.</li><li>
      You cannot specify group by / sum queries – You can only select the records in detail and then perform the aggregation in your report.</li><li>
      Number of entity join (link) limitations.</li><li>
      <strong>FetchXML reports cannot use non-CRM online data sources.</strong></li><li>
      Learning curve – for report writers that are not familiar with FetchXML the syntax is quite different from SQL.</li></ul><p>What do you need get started writing Fetch based CRM Custom Reports?</p><ul class="ul1"><li>
