Studies have shown that you can get up to a 30% increase in productivity by using                     more than one monitor when you work.

<!--endintro-->

Providing users with the ability to access more information and images simultaneously,                     multiple monitor configurations allow for more efficient multitasking between applications.

For example, if you were a developer; you could have your references in one monitor                     and your Visual Studio in another, and directly compare the two without compromising                     on space or layout.
