Passwords are a traditional technology that create security vulnerabilities through reuse, breaches, and phishing attacks. Passwords remain a weak point in your security chain. Passkeys represent the next evolution in authentication, providing phishing-resistant, seamless integration with biometric technology, and passwordless security that's both more secure and more convenient than traditional methods.

## Why Passkeys are superior to passwords

### Security benefits

1. **Phishing-resistant** - Unlike passwords and SMS codes, passkeys cannot currently be stolen through phishing attacks because they use cryptographic keys tied to specific domains
2. **No password reuse** - Each passkey is unique to a service
3. **Breach-proof** - Services only store your public key, so even if breached, attackers get nothing useful
4. **No interceptable codes** - Unlike SMS-based MFA, passkeys can't be intercepted or redirected

### User experience benefits

1. **Faster sign-in** - Authenticate with just your biometric (fingerprint, face, or PIN) - no typing passwords or waiting for SMS codes
2. **Synced across devices** - Passkeys created with major providers like Google, Apple, or Microsoft automatically sync across your devices using their secure cloud services (e.g.: Google Password Manager, iCloud Keychain). This means a passkey you create on your phone will be available on your tablet and laptop, as long as you're signed into the same account.
3. **No forgotten passwords** - Never forget a password again or get locked out of accounts

## How to set up passkeys for your Microsoft Entra Account

### Prerequisites

* If you haven't set up the Microsoft Authenticator app with your account yet, follow these steps:
   1. Go to [https://mysignins.microsoft.com/security-info](https://mysignins.microsoft.com/security-info)
   2. Select **+ Add sign-in method**
   3. Choose **Microsoft Authenticator** from the dropdown and select Add
   4. Open Authenticator on your phone, click the **+** and select **Work or school account**
   5. Then tap **Scan a QR Code**
* A device that supports biometric authentication (fingerprint, face recognition, or PIN)

### Steps to create a passkey

1. **Navigate to your Microsoft security settings**

   * Go to [https://mysignins.microsoft.com/security-info](https://mysignins.microsoft.com/security-info)
   * Sign in with your Microsoft account credentials

2. **Add a new sign-in method**

   * Click **+ Add sign-in method**

3. **Choose your passkey type**

   * Select **Passkey in Microsoft Authenticator**. This will create a passkey stored securely on your phone, which you can use to sign in on this or other devices.

4. **Set up through Microsoft Authenticator**

   * In Authenticator app select your Microsoft account
   * Then select **Create a passkey** and follow the instructions

6. **Test your passkey**

   * Sign out of your Microsoft account
   * When signing back in, select **"Other ways to sign in"**
   * Choose **Face, fingerprint, PIN, or security key** option
   * Use your biometric authentication to complete sign-in

### Managing passkeys

* **View all passkeys:** Return to [https://mysignins.microsoft.com/security-info](https://mysignins.microsoft.com/security-info) to see all registered passkeys
* **Remove passkeys:** Delete unused passkeys for old or lost devices

## The future is passwordless

Most companies including SSW have committed to the vision of a passwordless future. By adopting passkeys now, you're not just improving your current security posture - you're preparing for a world where passwords become obsolete.
