When speaking with a colleague they might assign you a task. Then you start to action the task, even though you're aware of a better way to go about it. This situation is a problem, as you can end up spending more money than was necessary.

<!--endintro-->

When you become aware of the problem, it is important to raise it and let your colleague know that there is a way to get better ROI. 

In the software world we use a simple calculation on PBIs of [Business Value รท Effort](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/do-you-estimate-business-value)

If your colleague still disagrees with you then it may be a good idea to [send a 'For the record' email](/send-a-for-the-record-email-when-you-disagree).

### Hi Bob,

Done - I have fixed the email signature by changing the file server's HTML and it took me 1 hour. 

Thanks!

Figure: Bad Example - George knew there was a way to get better ROI while fixing the signature as he was currently working on implementing a 3rd party solution, that would require less manual labour. However, he did not mention it

### Hi Bob,

Done - I have fixed the email signature by changing the file server's HTML and it took me 1 hour. 

**ROI Consideration -** As per our conversation, for future changes to email signatures, let's wait until I implement the new 3rd party solution I am working on. This will give better ROI because I won't need to do any further wasted work.

Thanks!

Piers

Figure: Good Example - George suggested to wait until he had setup the 3rd party solution that he was working on as it would deliver improved ROI

**Note:** If fixing the email signatures had been a huge task then it would have been better for Piers to have a conversation with Bob before he implemented the fix.
