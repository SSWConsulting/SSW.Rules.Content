When speaking with a colleague they might assign you a task. Then you start to action the task, even though you're aware of a better way to go about it. This situation is a problem as you can end up spending more money than was necessary.

<!--endintro-->

When you become aware of the problem, it is important to raise it and let your colleague know that there is a way to get better ROI - Return on Investment. 

It is a simple calculation of Business Value รท Effort.

If your colleague still disagrees with you then it may be a good idea to [send a 'For the record' email](/send-a-for-the-record-email-when-you-disagree).

### Hi Sean,

I will look into fixing the signature by changing the file server's HTML.

Thanks!

Figure: Bad Example - George knew there was a way to get better ROI while fixing the signature as he was currently working on implementing a 3rd party solution, that would require less manual labour. However he did not mention it

### Hi Sean,

I will look into fixing the signature by changing the file server's HTML.

**ROI Tip:** I believe it would be a better use of ROI if we wait until I implement the new 3rd party solution I've been working on to fix your signature. The ROI will be better because the cost of my manual labour is significantly more than the cost of the 3rd party solution.

Thanks!

George
