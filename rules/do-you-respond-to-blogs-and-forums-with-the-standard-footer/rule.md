If you see something in a blog that interests you or that you disagree with, reply                     to it. You should not be afraid to voice your opinion and it's a great way to make                     a name for yourself and your company on the world wide web.

<!--endintro-->

Whenever anyone in your organization responds to a blog entry or forum,               they should always use the [standard company footer](/products-branding/).

This will help with [branding](/rules-to-better-branding/), company recognition, and brings a sense of unity to everyone within your company when they see each other's entries.
