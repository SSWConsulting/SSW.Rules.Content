If you see something in a blog that interests you or that you disagree with, reply                     to it. You should not be afraid to voice your opinion and it's a great way to make                     a name for yourself and your company on the world wide web.

<!--endintro-->

Whenever anyone in your organization responds to a blog entry or forum,                     they should always use the [standard company footer](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/standards/rules/RulesToBetterBranding.aspx#EmailSignatures).

This will help with [branding](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/standards/rules/RulesToBetterBranding.aspx),                     company recognition, and brings a sense of unity to everyone within your company                     when they see each other's entries.
