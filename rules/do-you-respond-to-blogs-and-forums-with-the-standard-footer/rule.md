<p>
                    If you see something in a blog that interests you or that you disagree with, reply
                    to it. You should not be afraid to voice your opinion and it's a great way to make
                    a name for yourself and your company on the world wide web.
                </p>

<p>
                    Whenever anyone in your organization responds to a blog entry, forum, or usergroup,
                    they should always use the <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/standards/rules/RulesToBetterBranding.aspx#EmailSignatures">
                        standard company footer</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This will help with <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/standards/rules/RulesToBetterBranding.aspx">branding</a>,
                    company recognition, and brings a sense of unity to everyone within your company
                    when they see each other's entries.
                </p>
