<span class='intro'> <p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">CRM is primarily a sales tool and customer database, but also has a simple marketing section with the ability to run campaigns and quick campaigns. However the team has no plans to expand upon this in the future. MDM perfectly fills this gap.​</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">MDM replaces the Marketing part of CRM, or it can be used as a standalone system instead. As well as simple campaign tracking, MDM also provides marketing planning, budgeting, management, execution, automation, tracking (for ROI), and BI.</p> </span>

<p>MDM is also set up to work well if you are a Marketing Services Provider, and need to track different campaigns for different clients.</p>
<p>​While CRM is good for managing a sales process once you have leads, MDM is the perfect tool to create and score those leads in the 1st&#160;place, providing fuel for the sales engine to work on.​</p>
