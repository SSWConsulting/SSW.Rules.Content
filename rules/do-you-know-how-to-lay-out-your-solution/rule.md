Whenever we setup a new Team Project we implement a basic version control structure. We put "readme.txt" files in the folder structure explaining the different levels, and a solution file called [Client].[Product].sln?located at ?/[Client]/[Product]/DEV/ within version control.
<dl class="image">&lt;dt&gt;
      <img alt="Messy solution " src="MessySolution.jpg" style="margin:5px;">
   &lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: Bad Example, how would anyone know how to sort this mess out?</dd></dl>
<!--endintro-->
<dl class="image">&lt;dt&gt; 
      <img alt="Ideal solution " src="IdealSolution.jpg"> 
   &lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: Good Example, The ideal solution. </dd></dl>
