You're about to kick off a new Program Increment (PI), and the development teams are all set. However, you notice that the business stakeholders are not actively involved, leading to a disconnect between what's being built and what the business actually needs. Involving business stakeholders in PI planning can bridge this gap.

## What is Program Increment (PI) Planning?

Program Increment (PI) planning is a routine event in the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) where all members of an Agile Release Train (ART) come together to understand the priorities for the upcoming PI, discuss technical considerations, and create plans.

### Benefits of Involving Business Stakeholders
