Line art graphics and anything with well defined shapes (logos, vector illustrations, e.t.c.) must be saved in SVG format.

Some of SVG format advantages are:

* Written in XML
* Text-based
* Official W3C graphics standard
* Accessible for people with visual disabilities
* Searchable
* Can be animated
* No pixelation
* Small file size
* Supports transparency
* Text can be selected, copied, spoken by the computer, and indexed by search engines.
