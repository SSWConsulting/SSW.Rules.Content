A poorly planned handover can result in wasted time, repeated work, and confusion for the person taking over. Imagine walking into a project with no context, outdated documentation, and a scattering of files across different systems. Itâ€™s frustrating and itâ€™s preventable.

<!--endintro-->

Thereâ€™s no one-size-fits-all template for a handover. It should be tailored to your project, your role, and whether the handover is temporary (e.g. vacation) or permanent (e.g. project transition). But you should always **plan from the perspective of the person receiving the handover**.

## Ensure access is sorted early

The first blocker for any new person is access. Remove that hurdle by organizing:

* Credentials stored securely (e.g. password manager)
* Permissions to systems, tools, folders, and environments

Coordinate with sysadmins or clients in advance to avoid blockers.

## Organize files into a single source of truth

Donâ€™t leave your successor scavenging for files. If your team doesnâ€™t already have a designated location for handover assets, create a central folder (e.g. SharePoint or a shared drive) and include:

* Design files (e.g. Figma)
* Project documentation
* Code repositories
* Backlogs and task lists
* Secured credentials

At the root level, add aÂ `_instructions.md`Â orÂ `README`Â to explain the folder structure and what each file contains.

If your team already has a defined location (like a client-managed drive or internal system), follow that instead and just make sure your files are up to date and easy to navigate.

## Document whatâ€™s not obvious

Some things just wonâ€™t be clear by looking at files. Write down:

* Current project status and objectives
* Key decisions and why they were made
* Trade-offs, assumptions, and constraints
* Known issues, risks, and technical debt
* Outstanding or partially completed tasks

Good documentation avoids repeated questions and poor decisions.

## Turn future work into actionable tickets

Donâ€™t leave future tasks buried in meeting notes or your memory. If follow-ups are expected from workshops, client discussions, or ongoing work, **log them now**.

Make each ticket clear and self-contained:

* Include context, relevant links (e.g. designs, documents), and rationale
* Reference key discussions or decisions in the comments
* Flag priorities with the Product Owner

This ensures nothing falls through the cracks and gives your successor a clear path forward, with everything they need in one place.

## Share recordings that matter

In some cases, a short video is more helpful than a wall of text. Add:

* Demo recordings
* Workshop walkthroughs
* Relevant meeting sessions

Label each video clearly with what it covers and why itâ€™s useful.

## Send a mini-onboarding email

New joiners can feel overwhelmed. Help them ramp up with a structured welcome message that links them to the right places and explains what to do first.

## Run a handover walkthrough

Book a live session to:

* Walk through the file structure
* Show designs, workflows, or code
* Answer any questions they may have

Make it conversational, not just a reading of your notes.

## Connect them with the right people

Introduce your successor to:

* Product Owners
* Sysadmins
* Key team members

::: info
**Bonus:** Share cultural context like whoâ€™s approachable, communication norms, or anything helpful to avoid social blind spots (no bias or gossip!).

By thinking of your handover as a **user experience** for your successor, you help ensure the transition is clear, respectful, and productive for everyone.
