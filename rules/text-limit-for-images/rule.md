<p>​Advertising on Facebook means you will have to adhere to the guidelines Facebook have created&#58; <a href="https&#58;//www.facebook.com/policies/ads/">https&#58;//www.facebook.com/policies/ads/</a>. One of the most important guidelines to follow is the 20% text rule on all ad images.</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p></p><p>This requires that there is no more than 20% text on any image used in Facebook Ads. This limit includes logos and slogans. Failure to meet this guideline will result in your ads not being approved by Facebook, and will require you to adjust the text amount on your image before they can be run.</p><p>Facebook have created a grid which can be used to check if you meet this limit&#58; <a href="https&#58;//www.facebook.com/ads/tools/text_overlay">https&#58;//www.facebook.com/ads/tools/text_overlay</a>.&#160;</p>
