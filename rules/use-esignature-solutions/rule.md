If you don’t have access to a paid eSignature tool, a more cost-effective workaround is to print the document to PDF, sign it digitally, and return it via email.
While this approach doesn’t offer tracking or automation like DocuSign, it's still far more efficient than printing, signing by hand, and scanning.

## Benefits of eSignature Solutions

* **Speed** - Eliminates the delay caused by printing, signing manually, and scanning
* **Efficiency** - Streamlines processes and reduces the need for physical paperwork
* **Security** - Ensures encrypted digital signatures, making it more secure than physical signatures
* **Accessibility** - Sign documents from anywhere at any time using any device

## Implementation Process

When implementing an eSignature solution:

1. **Choose the right platform** - Based on your business needs, select between solutions like DocuSign or Adobe Sign
2. **Identify Use Cases** - Determine all the instances and departments within your organization where eSignature solutions can be used. This can range from HR and legal to sales and external communications
3. **Determine User Needs** - Estimate how many users will need access to the eSignature platform (E.g. in a company of 100 people, you might only need 2 users)
4. **Cost Estimation** - Once you've determined the number of users, assess the cost implications (E.g. 2 users are around $700 per annum)
5. **Setup** - Follow the step-by-step guidelines provided by the chosen platform. Consider registering the license on a shared email account (E.g. `Projects@Northwind.com` or `Accounts@Northwind.com`)\
   **Note:** Do not share sensitive documents on a shared email account without ensuring data confidentiality
6. **Integration** - Integrate the solution with your existing software and tools for seamless operation (E.g. Microsoft Teams and Dynamics 365)
7. **Internal Documentation** - Create detailed internal documents or guides on how to use the app. This ensures consistency in usage and helps new users get onboarded quickly
