When asking for changes to be made to any file like a web page, Word document, PowerPoint slide or code, always include the original version of the content ("X") together with the changes you require ("Y"). This means you have at hand a history of the page or file as it currently stands allowing for convenient future reference and also makes it very clear to the person doing the changes exactly what the new file is meant to look like. 

Make the changes even easier to see and understand by highlighting in <font style="background-color:#ff0000;">red</font> what you want to delete (only do this on the "From" section) and in <font style="background-color:#ffff00;">yellow</font> what you want to be added/updated (only do this on the "To" section).  All text we do not write ourselves should be indented, so this includes paragraphs we are copying and pasting (see [Do you use indentation for readability?](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=4d9255a5-7b57-4f98-9e86-3bbb8a64ce75))

Figure: Good Example - it has 'From' and 'To' with changes highlighted... so it is clear what needs to be changed

### If there are too many changes


Sometimes you have a lot of content and too many changes, making the process "from X to Y" too arduous. In this case is recommended to use     [Word 'Track Changes'](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/track-changes-in-word-197ba630-0f5f-4a8e-9a77-3712475e806a) functionality.
