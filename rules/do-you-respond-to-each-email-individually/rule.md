(AKA - don't respond to a series of emails in one email) If you receive separate emails, respond to each email individually. Don't answer a few emails in one email.

* Each email is a little job (eating the elephant one bit at a time)

* You get a steady flow back as bits are achieved (can get a feel or monitor employees efficiency)

* You can move to 'todo' list folders

* You get a email history for that one topic
