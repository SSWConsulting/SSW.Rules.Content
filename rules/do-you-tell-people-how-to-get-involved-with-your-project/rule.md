<span class='intro'> <p>The key to building a great open source project is to build a great community around your project.</p><p>To do this it is essential that potential contributors can find out how to get involved.​</p> </span>

<p>​​It is a common pattern for open source projects to contain a CONTRIBUTING.md markdown file that supplies information on how to get involved.​​
