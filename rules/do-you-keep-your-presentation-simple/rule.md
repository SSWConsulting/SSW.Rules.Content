Making your presentation over-complicated is a very easy trap to fall into. Many speakers make the mistake of giving way too much information.

In reality, giving a presentation is an entirely different genre from writing a technical report.

**KISS** - In its polite form, this stands for  **K** eep  **I** t  **S** hort and  **S** imple.

* In 20 minutes, you only have time for two major points
* In 30 minutes you might make three major points
* In 40-45 minutes you might be able to cover four major points, but three points and a longer time for questions would be a better alternative


Most experienced and talented TV presenters stick to making three points in half an hour - this is surely a lesson for anyone planning a presentation.
