<span class='intro'> 
  <p>Making your presentation over-complicated is a very easy trap to fall into. Many speakers make the mistake of giving way too much information.</p>
<p>In reality, giving a presentation is an entirely different genre from writing a technical report.</p>
 </span>


  <p>
    <strong>KISS</strong> - In its polite form, this stands for <strong>K</strong>eep <strong>I</strong>t <strong>S</strong>hort and <strong>S</strong>imple.</p>
<ul>
    <li>In 20 minutes, you only have time for two major points </li>
    <li>In 30 minutes you might make three major points </li>
    <li>In 40-45 minutes you might be able to cover four major points, but three points and a longer time for questions would be a better alternative </li>
</ul>
<p>Most experienced and talented TV presenters stick to making three points in half an hour - this is surely a lesson for anyone planning a presentation.</p>
