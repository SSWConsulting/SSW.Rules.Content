<p>In reality, giving a presentation is an entirely   different genre from writing a technical report.</p>
<p><strong>KISS</strong> - In its polite form, this   stands for <strong>K</strong>eep <strong>I</strong>t <strong>S</strong>hort   and <strong>S</strong>imple.</p>
<ul>
  <li>In 20 minutes, you only have time for two major   points</li>
  <li>In 30 minutes you might make three major points</li>
  <li>In 40-45 minutes you might be able to cover four   major points, but three points and a longer time for questions would be   a better alternative</li>
</ul>
<p>Most experienced and talented TV presenters   stick to making three points in half an hour - this is surely a lesson   for anyone planning a presentation.</p>
