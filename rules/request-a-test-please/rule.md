These are the steps you should take when request a "test please":

<!--endintro-->

1. Find two free testers to send the email below
2. Stop working on the project until you receive either a "pass" or "fail" email
3. Create your "test please" following this template:

::: email-template  
|          |     |
| -------- | --- |
| To:      | John |
| Subject: | Test Please - Product Name v1.11 |  
::: email-content  

### Hi John,  
I am looking for bugs or approval to release this version.

1. Please test the following modifications:

* {{ Feature to test }}
* {{ Feature to test }}

I have done what I could for my code's health. E.g.

* Run SSW Code Auditor - it has {{ X }} errors [If not 0, give reason]
* Run SSW Link Auditor - it has {{ X }} errors [If not 0, give reason]
* Kept my eye on Application Insights

Specific issues to look out for are:

* {{ Issue }}
* {{ Issue }}

The latest version (Product Name v1.11) is at {{ URL }}

Keep in mind that a "test please" is an urgent task and that it should start within the hour.

**Note:**
* Know the [definition of a bug](/management-is-your-client-clear-on-the-definition-of-a-bug)
* Understand the importance of testing. Read the rule on [Do you conduct a "test please" internally and then with the client?](/conduct-a-test-please-internally-and-then-with-the-client)
* Send suggestions/bugs one email at a time (with a unique email subject) because it makes it easier to fix and reply "done"
  * Please CC the project manager and the client
  * [Use good subjects on your emails](/do-you-realize-the-importance-of-a-good-email-subject)
* Do not reply to this message until you can say "**Test Please Succeeded** (as no Critical bugs). You are ready to deploy." or "**Test Please Failed** (as per Critical bugs reported)"

Thanks,   
Peter

### DO NOT send a 'Test Please' via Teams (with the content)

You should use Teams to point the tester to the 'Test Please' email:

::: greybox
"Ping!   
I need you to see my 'Test Please' email   
See subject: **Test Please - Product Name v1.11**"
:::

::: info
**Note to developers:**
If current version is better than the last version you can release (even with a test fail) as long:
- The bugs reported in the test fail existed in the old version
- Two people have tested it
- The changes in this version are fairly important to get out
- You get to work on the failures ASAP
:::

### What if you're doing a Windows Forms test?

Then you should also include this to the email:
- The latest version of {{Product Name}} has been uploaded to **\\frog\SSW\Download\[Application\_verX-XX\_beta.exe**
- Test on a fresh VPC image of Windows
- Install into a non-default directory
- Check the installation folder for misplaced items
- Test Unit Tests via "Help - Run Unit Tests"
- (If Applicable)Test the "Create" and "Reconcile" buttons. Read [Rules to Better .NET Projects](/rules-to-better-net-projects)
- Test open and closing forms and saving values
- Test most buttons and menus and links
- Disable your network connection and test again (check for unhandled errors)
- If your test fails, please rename the executable to **Application\_verX-XX\_failed.exe**

### What if you are doing an email test?

In most cases, you can follow [Do you use 'Checked by xxx'?](/checked-by-xxx)

For really important stuff you may need to actually send a 'Test Please' email to test your email. In these cases:

- DO NOT add 'Test Please' to the subject. (it is too easy to forget later!)
- Instead, add 'Test please' highlighted in yellow to the top of the email body
