If an email isn't clear, a phone call generally sorts problems out quickly.

We've all received a cryptic email at some point. Don't just reply saying "I don't understand". Call the person who sent the email instead. Chances are if the sender of the task couldn't explain the task well enough the first time, it's likely a voice conversation is needed to clarify the issue.   

<!--endintro-->

Having clarified the issue by phone, update the task by replying to the original email with the new details arising from the conversation. [Remember to start with an "As per our conversation"](/as-per-our-conversation-emails).

### Hi Danny,

As per our conversation, I needed a bit more information to complete this task. Next time, it would be great if you could include additional information like the below so I could complete it without bothering you.

### To Myself,

\[Fill in the information you just got from the conversation\]

However, sometimes you cannot immediately reach the task owner. In this case, you should try to contact the person a few more times. If you are still not able to contact them, you should reply to the email and put the following in the first line:
