We've all&#160;received a cryptic email at some point. Don't just reply saying &quot;I don't understand&quot;. Chances are if the sender of the task couldn't&#160;explain the task well enough the first time then it's likely&#160;conversation is needed to clarify the issue. Pick up the phone or Skype&#160;the person who sent the email.

In this case, you need to keep trying to contact the&#160;person for 24 hours. If you are still not able to contact the person, you need to reply to the email and put the following in red in the first line&#58; <br><div class="ms-rteCustom-GreyBox"><p>Hi John<br></p>
<p style="color&#58;red;">(As per our conversation, I needed a bit more information to complete this task&#160;- next time, it would be great if you could&#160;include additional information like the below so I could&#160;complete it&#160;without bothering you)<br>FYI - This task has been put onto the backlog and should be looked at in the next sprint.<br></p>
