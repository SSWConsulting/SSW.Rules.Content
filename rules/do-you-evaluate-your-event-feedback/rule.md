After the event it is also critical that you analyse the feedback. Why else would you be gathering it?

<!--endintro-->

Look for trends in the data and evaluate what you can do better next time and what you should possibly leave out.

You should then send a retrospective email to relevant team members, and let them know how you feel the event went, and ask for their feedback.

Remember to include important feedback like:



* Any great comments from the evaluation forms
* Any not so great feedback from the evaluation forms
* Points for improvement
* Stats on the free demand generation (how 'Googleable' is your event)
* Stats on the paid demand generation (if applicable)
* The demand generation of the speaker (for example did they Tweet your event & what engagement did it get)
