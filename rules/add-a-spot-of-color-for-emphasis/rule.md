When there are key words that you want people to notice, you can add a spot of color on the important word for emphasis.

<!--endintro-->

You should make parts of the text different colors just like you’d highlight or boldface parts of a sentence. The duo colored text will help emphasize your message. Whenever possible use the brand colors when you do this.
