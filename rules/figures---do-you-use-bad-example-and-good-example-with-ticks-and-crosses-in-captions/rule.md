<span class='intro'> <p>The best way to emphasize your point is to &quot;build&quot; the pain first and then show the solution. So we use &quot;Bad Example&quot; and &quot;Good Example&quot; in the captions where possible.</p> </span>

<p>To do this, we give a bad example and raise users' expectation first.</p><dl class="badImage"><dt><img alt="bad example" src="/PublishingImages/ImageBadExample.gif" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Bad Example - kid not in his seat</dd></dl><p>Now we can show the solution and give a good example as the result, make them feel released.</p><dl class="goodImage"><dt><img alt="good example" src="/PublishingImages/kid-in-airplane-seat.jpg" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good Example - kid in his seat</dd></dl>
