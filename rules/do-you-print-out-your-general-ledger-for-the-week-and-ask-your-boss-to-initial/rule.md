<p>You should print out your general ledger for the week and then ask your boss to initial with &quot;cheque number and memo descriptions good&quot;.</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>This is very important task for your first month in the job, otherwise you may find yourself going back and have to fix up all data. Do whatever you have to do e.g. drive to your boss' house to get this done! It can save your days off work.</p><dl class="image"><dt><img src="/Management/Rules-to-Better-Accounting/PublishingImages/ledger-for-week.jpg" alt="" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Weekly ledger</dd></dl>
