Page speed remains a critical element for the online user experience. The demand for instant information has made faster loading times more crucial than ever.

Users are less patient, and if a webpage takes too long to load, they are likely to abandon it in frustration. This not only results in a lost visitor but also poses a risk to potential conversions.

For a smooth and responsive user experience, your site needs to be checked for performance bottlenecks. These usually become noticeable sometime after deployment, as your user base and quantity of content grows.

This includes checking for improvements on:

* The slowest pages
* The compression of unnecessarily large images
* Slow database queries
* Page responsiveness

::: greybox
A website with large, uncompressed images, excessive plugins, and unoptimized code can lead to slow loading times.

Visitors may encounter delays, increasing the likelihood of frustration and abandonment.

This negatively impacts user experience and potential conversions.

2. Right-click anywhere on the page and choose Inspect (or press F12)
3. Navigate to the Performance tab
4. Click Record, then reload the page to capture performance data
5. After recording, you'll see metrics like Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), and other key performance indicators
