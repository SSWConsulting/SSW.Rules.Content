Page speed remains a critical element for the online user experience.

The demand for instant information has made faster loading times more crucial than ever. Users today are less patient, and if a webpage takes too long to load, they are likely to abandon it in frustration. This not only results in a lost visitor but also poses a risk to potential conversions. 👎

**💡 Tip:** Use this free Google tool named [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) to test your URL.

For a smooth and responsive user experience, your site needs to be checked for performance bottlenecks. These usually become noticeable sometime after deployment, as your user base and quantity of content grows.

This includes checking for improvements on:

* The slowest pages
* The compression of unnecessarily large images
* Slow database queries
* Page responsiveness

A website with large, uncompressed images, excessive plugins, and unoptimized code can lead to slow loading times.

Visitors may encounter delays, increasing the likelihood of frustration and abandonment.

This negatively impacts user experience and potential conversions.
