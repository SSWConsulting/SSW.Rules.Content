<span class='intro'> <p>
      One of the first things you need to include when building a website is an 'About
      Us' section. An 'About Us' section gives the website credibility and more importantly
      gives readers an overview of you and your company.
     </p><p>
      At SSW we based our 'About Us' page on 4 criteria; these are 4 aspects that we feel
      potential clients would want to know. Below is an example of the most important
      aspects we felt needed to be addressed on the SSW 'About Us' page&#58;
