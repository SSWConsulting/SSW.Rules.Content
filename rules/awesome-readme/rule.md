Have you ever opened a promising project, only to be lost because the README was unclear? It's a frustrating experience and causes users to quickly give up.

A good README helps others understand what your project does, how to set it up, and how to use it, reducing the learning curve and saving time for everyone involved. See some examples of great READMEs here: <https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme>

## Strong H1 and H2 Titles

Begin with a clear and concise title (H1) followed by a subtitle (H2) that provides a brief one-liner about what your project does, and helps with SEO (so others can find your project).
