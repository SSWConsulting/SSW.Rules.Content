Dynamics isn't as customisable as your average React or Angular website and there are some prohibitive restrictions. For example, M:M relationship records can only be added, updated and viewed via grids.

Use the power of [PCF controls](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/component-framework/overview) to customize Dynamics 365 and provide more flexible functionality.

PCF controls let you use your favourite web technologies to develop customized components. You can use React, Angular, Bootstrap, web apis and more ðŸ˜Ž. You no longer have to worry about learning new and confusing frameworks, you've got the power back in your hands!
