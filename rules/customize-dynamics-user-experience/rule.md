Dynamics isn't as customisable as your average React or Angular website and there are some prohibitive restrictions. For example, M:M relationship records can only be added, updated and viewed via grids.

Use the power of [PCF controls](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/component-framework/overview) to customize Dynamics 365 and provide more flexible functionality. 

<!--endintro-->

PCF controls let you use your favourite web technologies to develop customized components. You can use React, Angular, Bootstrap, web apis and more 😎. You no longer have to worry about learning new and confusing frameworks, you've got the power back in your hands!

[PCF Gallery](https://pcf.gallery/) is a fantastic place to find all kinds of PCF controls that fit different use cases.

See [Adam Cogan's blog post](https://adamcogan.com/2021/08/12/the-power-of-multi-select-multiple-options-on-forms/) or the video on [this rule](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/allow-multiple-options) to see how PCF controls can be applied in the real world.
