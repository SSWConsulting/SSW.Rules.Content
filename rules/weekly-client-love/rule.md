Being a good coder is not enough. There are multiple factors that can affect whether a project proceeds in a positive or a negative way. One factor that can have a significant impact on a project is the relationship between the developer and the client. This relationship is also important as it can help bring clients back for more work.

A great way of taking a small step each week is to do something on a more personal basis for the client.

![Figure: Show clients that you're more than just an awesome developer](Keyboard-Heart.jpg)

Each week give some love your current client, or a past one.

There are many ways to show "Client Love", giving them a call is the best but a simple LinkedIn message or email is ok.

Here are some things a developer can do:

* Send an IM saying _I was just thinking about your project and I think this might be a good idea? {{ IDEA }}_
* Call the client and invite them to User Groups where the topic is related to their project
* Send an IM with a link to a web article that would interest them or thats relevant to their project
* Show interest in their industry (this will also help you to understand and fix their business problems)
* Send them a "happy birthday" message
* Talks and listen about non-work related things. People generally love talking about themselves and appreciate it when someone listens; most people don't take the time to listen. Here are some examples:
  * How was your weekend?
  * What are you doing this weekend?
  * General talking about their family / remembering the names of their family members
  * General talking about their hobbies
* Buy the client their favorite coffee

The tasks don't have to cost anything. Free tasks are more thoughtful and show the client you are thinking about them.

Some of these are also relevant to previous clients. Great consultants try to maintain a friendly relationship with previous clients, this will keep you in the back of the clients mind, and they will think of you next time they need some work done.

**Extra Reading:** For some, the above comes naturally. For everyone else, we highly recommend the book [How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://www.amazon.au/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034) written by Dale Carnegie. It is an easy read, the principles are easy to implement and will enhance all the relationships in your life.

Account managers need to [make sure their developers are giving "Client Love" to customers](/weekly-client-love).

## Documenting the conversation

Like any valuable conversation, its important you send an [as per our conversation](/as-per-our-conversation-emails) email. If you are calling the client its beneficial to draft this first (maybe get it checked by someone else) and use it as a guide for the conversation.

::: email-template  
|          |     |
| -------- | --- |
| To:      | {{ CLIENT }} |
| Cc:      | {{ ACCOUNT MANAGER }} |
| Subject: | {{ TOPIC }} |  
::: email-content  

### Hi {{ CLIENT NAME }}

It was good to hear {{ PROJECT }} is still helping your team.

As per our conversation, {{ SUMMARY OF CONVERSATION }}.

{{ CALL TO ACTION (e.g. If you're interested in implementing my idea, please let me know and I'll book out some time) }}

Thanks,
