Figuring out how your workflow operates is an essential part of the editing process. As such you should make sure to have an effective and consistent file/folder structure.

### Video Project Organization

- **YYYY-MM-DD-project-name**

  - Assets
    * Contains all external files, and a copy of any files used from the server's 05-assets directory
  - Edit
    * Contains the active project files, e.g. Premire Pro .pproj files
  - Exports
    * Contains all edit exports & renders
  - Footage
    * Contains all captured media, e.g. video, screen captures, & audio that was recorded for the project
      * Use **YYYY-MM-DD-description**
      * Contains multi-day or multi-camera shoots
    * Graphics
    * Contains After Effect project files, e.g. .aep files
