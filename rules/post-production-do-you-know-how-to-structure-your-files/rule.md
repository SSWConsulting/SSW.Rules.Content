Figuring out how your workflow operates is an essential part of the editing process. As such you should make sure to have an effective and consistent file/folder structure.

It is also very important to keep your shared resources and servers organised.
This is an efficient way for a team to structure their server and common files/folders:

        * The internal folder structure is:
