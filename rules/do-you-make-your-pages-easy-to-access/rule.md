<p>
                    A web page should not be more than 4 levels deep. Use a 
     drop-down menu to help users get to these pages quicker. For 
     larger site, you may want to consider mega dropdown menu.
                </p><p>
                    There is no point of having a web page if it is too hard for 
     the user to access from the main menu or from multiple links 
     on your site.
                </p>
