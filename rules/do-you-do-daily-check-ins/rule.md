<span class='intro'> Do you check-in with your boss in the morning to make sure you are both on the same page?<br> </span>

<p>​Having a daily scrum or check-in with your boss in the morning will make sure that you are both on the same page for the day to come.&#160;​Ask them what their appointments are for the day to ensure that they know what they have to do that day, and with whom they are meeting.<br></p><p>During this time you can tell them what you will be working on for that day, to ensure that you are working on the most important tasks.<br></p><p>If your boss is away, you can still check-in via phone or on Microsoft&#160;Teams.&#160;Try sending&#160;them&#160;an instant message via Teams first&#160;and let them know that you are trying to get hold of them.&#160;​<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-Tip">Tip&#58;</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Say&#160;&quot;I'm calling you in 10 minutes if you don't answer!&quot;<br></p><p><br></p>
