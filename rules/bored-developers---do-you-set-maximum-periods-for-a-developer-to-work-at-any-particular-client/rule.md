<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​​​​As a consultancy, your developers expect to see a variety of projects in their time working for you, and if they get stuck on any one client for too long, they may decide to look elsewhere for that variety.</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>In order to keep them interested, it’s a good idea to cycle them off and on to particularly long projects. This should be proactively offered to developers, as they may not realise it’s an option.</p><p>You also need to make sure this is not a nasty surprise for the client, so it’s best to add it to your contract or Terms and Conditions &#160;so it’s understood from the start, and can always be referred back to later. To soften the blow, offer to cover the costs of the new developer for the handover period (normally 1-2 days)<br></p>
