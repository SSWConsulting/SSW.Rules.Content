<span class='intro'> <p>Most developers seem to validate a URL and tell the user what they have done wrong
                    only after the error happens. URL fields should show how the users must enter it.</p> </span>

<dl class="badImage"><dt>
                        <img src="url-field-bad.jpg" alt="Error message 'Cannot save record'" /></dt><dd>
                        Figure&#58; Bad example - U​sing a validation message to tell the user to enter a correct
                        URL</dd></dl><p>
                    The better way is to have the user avoid the error with a good default.</p><dl class="badImage"><dt>
                        <img src="url-field-bad2.jpg" alt="image showing blank textfield" /></dt><dd>
                        Figure&#58; Bad example - The user has a good chance of entering the URL in the incorrect format​​​</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt>
                        <img src="url-field-good.jpg" alt="image showing a textfield pre-populated with 'http&#58;//www.'" /></dt><dd>
                        Figure&#58; Good example - User immediately knows the format expected</dd></dl>
