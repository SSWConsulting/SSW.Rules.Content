When a company has many different office locations, often people in one office aren't familiar with people in other offices due to a lack of interaction. This problem is particularly pronounced where you have offices that span multiple time zones or countries.

**Tip:** You can use a [time zone converter](/collaborate-across-timezones/#use-time-zone-converter--time-difference-calculator) to know the time difference between offices. You may also install one of the numerous apps to help with that info.

## What improvements come from better interaction?

It is crucial to build **interaction** between all company offices because it often improves the following:

* Communication
* Relationships
* Technical Skills
* Access to resources
  * Knowing who has certain skills
  * Knowing who can provide you with localized or domain specific information
* Cooperation
* Confidence
* Knowledge of alternative approaches
* Cultural understanding
* Understanding of foreign perspectives
  * Knowing why someone from another culture responds to questions in a different way to what you are used to

## Boost interaction with unique strategies

Think about what your company can do to increase interaction. There are tonnes of ways that interaction can be developed. Examples include:

* **Team building activities**
  * Playing a game together
  * Solving a puzzle together
  * Reviewing/updating a company standard together
  * Go on a group trip (e.g., to the Great Wall of China)
  * Visit local companies together
  * Retreat - Have a company retreat to bring everyone together

* **[Cultural Exchange programs](/cultural-exchange)**
  * Having employees from China work in every Australian office for a month each or vice versa
  * Having developers from Brisbane spend a week in Melbourne

* **[Mentoring](/mentoring-programs)**

* **[Working together](/efficiency-do-you-always-try-to-work-in-pairs)**
  * Pair programming
  * Mob programming

* **Rotating Daily Scrum**
  * Each week, 1 person from each office is paired up to do a Daily Scrum with others

* **Creating cross-office teams and events**
  * Putting developers from the China office onto a project with Australian developers
  * People from different offices are paired up to have virtual coffee
  * A Chinese dev does a presentation at the Sydney User Group

* **Cultural events and videos**
  * Celebrating holidays from other countries
  * Organize meetings to discuss culturally different issues
  * Film videos about other offices
    * What is it like to work in the China office?
    * Localization - What is your reaction if you see Chinese on a web page?
    * What are the differences in the app market in China and Australia? I.e. WeChat vs Facebook etc
  * Have a weekly language exchange catchup
  * Having a cultural performance day where everyone chooses something cultural to perform such as a culturally relevant poem

* **Fun weekly company meetings**
  * Everyone meets on Friday for 30 minutes to discuss a fun question
