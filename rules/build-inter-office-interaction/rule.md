When a company has many different office locations, often people in one office aren't familiar with people in other offices due to a lack of interaction. This problem is particularly pronounced where you have offices that span multiple time zones or countries.

### What can be improved?
It is crucial to build **interaction** between all of the company offices because it often improves the following:

* Relationships
* Communication
* Technical Skills
* Resource access - TODO: Use different words or maybe an example?
* Cooperation
* Confidence
* Knowledge of alternative approaches
* Cultural understanding
* Understanding of foreign perspectives TODO: use different words or an example?

### Methods
There are tonnes of unique ways that interaction can be developed including:

* Team Building Activities e.g.
  * Playing a game together
  * Solving a puzzle together
  * Reviewing/updating a company standard together

* [Mentoring](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/mentoring-programs)

* [Pair Programming](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/efficiency-do-you-always-try-to-work-in-pairs) TODO: Working in pairs, or also mobbing

* Cultural Events e.g. 
  * Celebrating holidays from other countries
  * Having a cultural performance day where everyone chooses something cultural to perform such as a culturally relevant poem

* Creating cross-office teams e.g.
  * putting people from different offices into a scrum team

* A fun weekly company meeting e.g.
  * everyone meets on Friday for 30 minutes to discuss a fun question

* Rotating daily scrums e.g.
  * This week 1 person from each office is paired up to do a daily scrum with each other

* Virtual coffee events e.g.

  * People from different offices are paired up to have virtual coffee
