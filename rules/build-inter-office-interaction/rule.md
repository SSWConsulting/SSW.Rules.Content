When a company has many different office locations, often people in one office aren't familiar with people in other offices due to a lack of interaction. This problem is particularly pronounced where you have offices that span multiple time zones or countries.

### What can be improved?

It is crucial to build **interaction** between all company offices because it often improves the following:

* Communication
* Relationships
* Technical Skills
* Access to resources   
  E.g.
  * Knowing who has certain skills
  * Knowing who can provide you with localized or domain specific information
* Cooperation
* Confidence
* Knowledge of alternative approaches
* Cultural understanding
* Understanding of foreign perspectives   
  E.g.
  * knowing why someone from another culture responds to questions in a different way to what you are used to

### Methods

Think about what your company can do to increase interaction. There are tonnes of unique ways that interaction can be developed. Examples include:

* Team Building Activities   
  E.g.
  * Playing a game together
  * Solving a puzzle together
  * Reviewing/updating a company standard together
  * Go on a group trip to the Great Wall of China
  * Visit local companies together
  * Retreat - Have a company retreat to bring everyone together

* Employee Exchange   
  E.g.
  * Having developers from China work in every Australian office for a month each or vice versa
  * Having developers from Brisbane spend a week in Melbourne

* [Mentoring](/mentoring-programs)

* [Working together](/efficiency-do-you-always-try-to-work-in-pairs)   
  E.g.
  * Pair programming
  * Mob programming
  * Sitting together to work side-by-side

* Cultural Events   
  E.g.
  * Celebrating holidays from other countries
  * Having a cultural performance day where everyone chooses something cultural to perform such as a culturally relevant poem

* Creating cross-office teams   
  E.g.
  * Putting developers from the China office onto a project with Australian developers

* A fun weekly company meeting   
  E.g.
  * Everyone meets on Friday for 30 minutes to discuss a fun question

* Rotating Daily Scrum   
  E.g.
  * Each week 1 person from each office is paired up to do a Daily Scrum with each other

* Virtual coffee events   
  E.g.
  * People from different offices are paired up to have virtual coffee

* Get people involved with events for others offices (especially other countries)   
  E.g.
  * A Chinese dev does a presentation at the Sydney User Group

* Organise meetings to discuss culturally different issues   
  E.g.
  * Everyone talks about localization or WeChat Mini-Programs
  * Have a weekly language exchange catchup

* Film videos about other offices   
  E.g.
  * What is it like to work in the China office?
  * What are the differences in the app market in China and Australia? i.e. WeChat vs Facebook etc
  * Localization - What is your reaction if you see Chinese on a web page?
