When a company has many different office locations, often people in one office aren't familiar with people in other offices due to a lack of interaction. This problem is particularly pronounced where you have offices that span multiple time zones or countries.

**Tip:** You can use a [time zone converter](/collaborate-across-timezones/#use-time-zone-converter--time-difference-calculator) to know the time difference between offices. You may also install one of the numerous apps to help with that info.

## What improvements come from better interaction?

It is crucial to build **interaction** between all company offices because it often improves the following:

* **Communication**
* **Relationships**
* **Technical skills**
  * Knowing alternative approaches
* **Access to resources**
  * Knowing who has certain skills
  * Knowing who can provide you with localized or domain specific information
* **Cooperation**
* **Confidence**
* **Understanding of foreign perspectives**
  * Knowing why someone from another culture responds in a different way to what you are used to

## Boost interaction with unique strategies

Think about what your company can do to increase interaction. There are tonnes of ways that interaction can be developed. Examples include:

**Team building activities**

* Playing a game/solving a puzzle together
* Reviewing/updating a company standard together
* Having a company retreat to bring everyone together
* Going on a group trip (e.g., to the Great Wall of China)
* Visiting local companies together

**[Cultural Exchange programs](/cultural-exchange)**

* Having employees from China to work in every Australian office for a month each or vice versa
* Having developers from Brisbane spend a week in Melbourne

**[Mentoring](/mentoring-programs)**

**[Working together](/efficiency-do-you-always-try-to-work-in-pairs)**

* Pair programming
* Mob programming

**Rotating Daily Scrum**

* Each week, 1 person from each office is paired up to do a Daily Scrum with others

**Creating cross-office teams and events**

* Putting developers from the China office onto a project with Australian developers
* People from different offices are paired up to have virtual coffee
* A Chinese dev does a presentation at the Sydney User Group

**Cultural events and videos**

* Celebrating holidays from other countries
* Organize meetings to discuss culturally different issues
* Have a weekly language exchange catchup
* Organize a cultural performance day where everyone shares a piece from their culture

**Product videos about other offices**

* What is it like to work in the China office?
* What is your reaction if you see Chinese on a web page?
* What are the differences in the app market in China and Australia? I.e. WeChat vs Facebook

**Fun weekly company meetings**

* Everyone meets on Friday for 30 minutes to discuss a fun question
