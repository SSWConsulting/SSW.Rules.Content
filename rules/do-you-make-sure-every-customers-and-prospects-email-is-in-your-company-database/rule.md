Most companies keep all their customers' (and prospects') contact information in a database (e.g. CRM, SQL Server, Access, Oracle). This allows all staff to easily locate contact details about a particular person. So when you get an email, make sure you check that email address and it is in the company database.

We have a program called [SSW LookOut! for Outlook](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/LookOut/) to check for this rule. ![Stephen Koop not in database](StephenKoopIsNotInTheDatabase.jpg)**Figure: Stephen Koop needs to be put into the database** 
![Not in database](NotInDatabase.gif)**Figure: SSW Lookout! Can also check the emails that you are sending and tell you if the email address is not in your database.**
