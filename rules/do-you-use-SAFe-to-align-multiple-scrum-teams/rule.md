Imagine you're managing multiple Scrum teams and you're struggling to align them towards a common goal. Coordination becomes chaotic, and delivering value at scale seems like a distant dream. This is where the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) comes into play.

<!--endintro-->

## What is SAFe?

SAFe is an agile software development framework designed by Scaled Agile, Inc. It's meant to provide a guide for large organizations to scale agile and lean practices beyond single teams. Unlike Scrum, which focuses on the development process of individual teams, SAFe aligns teams to work towards strategic objectives.

### Benefits of Using SAFe

- **Alignment**: SAFe helps in aligning the work of multiple agile teams towards a common organizational goal.
- **Coordination**: It streamlines the roles and responsibilities, making it easier for teams to coordinate with each other.
- **Quality**: With a focus on continuous delivery, SAFe ensures that quality is not compromised.
