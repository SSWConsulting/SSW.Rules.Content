For better server security (especially regarding public facing servers), certain security protocols and ciphers should be disabled.


<!--endintro-->

Using a tool called "IIS Crypto 2.0" by     [Nartac](https://www.nartac.com/Products/IISCrypto), these protocols can be easily disabled instead of having to manually edit the Registry Keys.

1. Download IIS Crypto 2.0 (https://www.nartac.com/Products/IISCrypto/Download)
2. Run this on the server you wish to lock down
3. Select the best practices button

4. Ensure that TLS 1.0 is also disabled and hit apply 

5. The server will need to be rebooted before the settings take effect
