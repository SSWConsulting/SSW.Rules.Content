Only a madman would write software today without using source control.

Apart from being the easiest way to back-up your code, and having the ability to go back to a previous state, source control provides a huge number of benefits, especially when integrated with Continuous Integration servers, and Continuous Deployment solutions.

But which source control solution should I choose?

![Good Example – TFS Git works fantastically offline and with large code-bases. Visual Studio has support for the basic operations so developers can ease their way into working with git. Once users become familiar with it, it also allows for far more control and flexibility. Note: My Work and Code Review are not currently compatible with TFS Git, and you will need to fall back to the Git command line for more complex source control commands](git5.jpg)
