In order to get better clarity on what work is done, it's a good idea to connect your PBI's and tasks to the commits, branches and pull requests that relate to the item. All commits, branches and pull requests should be linked to a PBI.

Note: If you create your branches through Azure DevOps then you can link them during creation.

Here is a handy resource for linking work items:

Note: You can setup Branch Policies on your main branches to enforce this behaviour.
