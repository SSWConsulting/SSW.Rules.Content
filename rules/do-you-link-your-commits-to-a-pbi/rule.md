To improve visibility into what work has been done, link your PBIs and tasks to the related commits, branches, and pull requests. **Every commit, branch, and PR should be associated with a PBI.**

## Using Azure DevOps

If you create branches through Azure DevOps, you can link them to a work item during the creation process.

## Automating rule enforcement

You can [setup Branch Policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/branch-policies?WT.mc_id=DOP-MVP-33518) on your main branches to enforce this behaviour.
