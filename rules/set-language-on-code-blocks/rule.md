You should have a syntax highlighter to show pieces of code on your pages for a better readability. By specifying the language within your code block, you can enable color coding similar to that in an IDE.

Tools like [Prism](https://prismjs.com), [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org), or [Code Prettify](https://github.com/googlearchive/code-prettify) automatically apply syntax highlighting, making it easier for users to read code by color-coding different elements (e.g., keywords, strings, and variables).

::: info
See this [json file](https://unpkg.com/gatsby-remark-vscode@1.0.3/lib/grammars/manifest.json) for all supported languages and their aliases that can be used in SSW Rules.
:::

To activate this feature, add the language name right after the opening 3 backticks (used to [write a code in Markdown](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/rule/#11-code)).

For example, instead of starting a **JavaScript** code example with: **<code>\`\`\`</code>**, you should use **<code>\`\`\`js</code>** or **<code>\`\`\`javascript</code>** for syntax highlighting.

```none
let iceCream = 'chocolate';

if (iceCream === 'chocolate') {
  alert('Yay, I love chocolate ice cream!');    
} else {
  alert('Awwww, but chocolate is my favorite...');    
}
```

```
