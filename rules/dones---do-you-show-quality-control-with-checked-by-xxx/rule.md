​​​When you get your task done, you should carefully check each item in the email task and make sure it's qualified.&#160;For&#160;some tasks,&#160;you need someone to check it again for you before you send&#160;the &quot;Done​&quot;&#160;email.&#160;&#160;<br><div><br></div>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
Simply ask for that person to come over and check it on your computer or IM him/her if the person is not close by (e.g. in a&#160;different room).&#160;This way you are guaranteed instant feedback and you won't clog up someone else's inbox with unnecessary emails.&#160;<div>
   <br>Reply to&#160;the &quot;Done&quot; email like below and CC&#160;the person who checked the email for you. In this way, you show it was double checked. <dl class="goodImage"><dt> <img alt="ruleDoneCheckedBy.png" src="/PublishingImages/ruleDoneCheckedBy.png" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Reply Email with &quot;Checked by XXX&quot; &#160;</dd></dl><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">When you&#160;action a task for&#160;adding web content (such as&#160;a&#160;rule or suggestion),&#160;firstly&#160;paste the content into a new Word file&#160;and run the &quot;Grammar&#160;&amp; Spelling Check&quot; to check if there are&#160;any errors.&#160;After&#160;the&#160;&quot;Grammar &amp; Spelling Check&quot;, you can add it to your&#160;website. After that, run <a href="http&#58;//sswlinkauditor.com/">Link Auditor</a>&#160;in order to keep&#160;0 bad links on that page.<br></p></div>
