Tracking expenses can be a painful process of accumulating receipts and entering them into outdated systems… but there is a better way.   

Various apps help solve the above problem. Using a modern Accounting system such as Xero, some connected apps can be used in conjunction with the accounting system and they include:

* [Xero Me](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/xero-me/id991901494)
* [Expensify](https://www.expensify.com/)
* [Hubdoc](https://www.hubdoc.com/)

It may be difficult to determine which app would be best suited for your business so below is a comparison of some of the major features of each app.

<!--endintro-->

There are 2 purposes when evaluating an Expense app:

**\#1 Reimbursements** – when you are at the shop and you pay for something personally and want the app to take a photo and send it to the office and later see the $ come back into your account.
**\#2 General expenses** – when you are at the shop and using the company credit card, you don’t need reimbursement, but you do need to give accounts a photo of the receipt and the purchased item.

**Overall, the winner is Xero Me.** The design of the Xero Me app provides all the user experience to enable simple and convenient reimbursement requests or company spent money receipts for reconciliation. 

The best feature of Xero Me reimbursement is that the employee's bank details are automatically assigned when they submit a claim. The approver (Accountant or Business Owner), approves of the expense, it will be generated as a payable invoice in the 'Bills' section of Xero and dealt with like any other bill.

Although Expensify is capable of performing this function, it is expensive.

Expense apps are a timesaver, both for the day to day user, as well as the accountant receiving the expenses.

As a user, all you have to do is take a photo of the receipt from your mobile app, file or add any comments (all other data is pulled in via OCR “Smart-scan”), then all of these expenses get batched together and sent on a weekly basis to the accountant, who can then manage them in bulk.

As an added bonus in Xero Me, employees can also see their leave entitlements and payslips.
