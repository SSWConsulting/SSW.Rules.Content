React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. However, it doesn't provide built-in support for server-side rendering (SSR). This lack of SSR can lead to slow website load times and poor search engine optimization (SEO). That's where [Next.js](nextjs.org) comes in. Next.js is a framework built on top of React that provides several features and benefits for building high-performance websites.

### Reasons to choose Next.js

Here are some reasons to consider using Next.js instead of React alone:



- **Server-side rendering:** Next.js provides built-in support for SSR, which can significantly improve website performance and SEO by rendering pages on the server and sending HTML to the client. 
  - For example, the SSW Website is more accessible and SEO-friendly for search engines because its pages are rendered on the server using Next.js.



- **Automatic code splitting:** Next.js automatically splits code into smaller chunks, which can improve website performance by reducing the initial load time. 
  - For example, the SSW Websites uses Next.js to break code into smaller pieces and load only what's necessary for each page, making the website faster and more responsive.



- **Built-in CSS and image optimization:** Next.js has built-in support for optimizing CSS and images, which can help reduce website load times and improve performance.
  - For example, the SSW Website uses Next.js to optimize its images and CSS, making the website faster and more visually appealing.



- **Incremental adoption:** Next.js allows developers to add server-side rendering and other advanced features incrementally to an existing React application, making it easy to adopt and integrate into existing projects. 
  - For example, the SSW Website used Next.js to add server-side rendering to existing React components, making the website faster and more SEO-friendly.

### Summary



By using Next.js instead of React alone, developers can reduce the pain points users may experience and build high-performance websites more efficiently. However, it's important to note that Next.js may not be the best choice for every project, and developers should evaluate their project's specific needs and requirements before making a decision.
