To follow best practices for version control for Power BI reports you must know about the following features:

- [Power BI Desktop projects (PBIP)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/projects/projects-overview)
- [Git integration in Power BI Service via Microsoft Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/cicd/git-integration/intro-to-git-integration)
  - Requires either Fabric capacity or a Power BI Premium per User license
  - Currently only integrates with Git repos in Azure DevOps

The following video provides an overview of these features.

1. Convert all your Power BI reports to the PBIP format

   - First enable Power BI Projects in Power BI Desktop - File | Option Settings | Options | Preview features | Power BI project (.pbip) save option
   - Second "Save As" all your .pbix files as .pbip

   - Converting reports to the PBIP format decomposes it into the following artifacts.

     - [A Dataset folder](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/projects/projects-dataset), which contains files and folders representing a Power BI dataset
     - [A Reports folder](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/projects/projects-report), which contains the report settings, metadata for custom visuals, etc.

2. Commit the PBIP artifacts into a Git repository in an Azure DevOps project. Note, as of this writing Power BI's Git integration only works with Azure DevOps.

   **Note:** Once you convert the report Power BI Desktop will save a copy of the data into a file called [cache.abf](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/projects/projects-dataset#pbicacheabf) which gets stored in a ".pbi" folder inside the Dataset folder. This file should not be saved in version control. You can create a .gitignore file to prevent Git from committing it to the repository.

3. [Connect a workspace in Power BI Service with a branch in the Git repo in Azure DevOps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/cicd/git-integration/git-get-started?tabs=commit-to-git#connect-a-workspace-to-an-azure-repo)
