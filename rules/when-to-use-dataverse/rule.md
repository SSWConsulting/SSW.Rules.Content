## Consider Using Microsoft Dataverse When:

- **Integrated App Development**: If you aim to develop applications with tight integration to your data using Power Apps or other Power Platform components.
  
- **Robust Security & Compliance**: If you're looking for built-in security measures and tools that align with compliance standards and guidelines set by Microsoft.
  
- **Rapid Application Deployment**: When the need for quick application deployment and prototyping is high, leveraging Dataverse's built-in capabilities can be beneficial.
  
- **Out-of-the-Box Data Modeling**: If you want to avoid the intricacies of custom data model design and prefer using pre-defined templates and structures.
  
- **Seamless Integration with Microsoft Tools**: If your operations heavily depend on Microsoft solutions like Dynamics 365, Office 365, or other Power Platform services.
  
- **Automatic Scalability**: If you want a solution that auto-scales based on demand without manual interventions.

## Opt for Traditional Databases (e.g., SQL) When:

- **Custom Data Architecture**: If you require deep customization in your data architecture beyond what Dataverse templates offer.
  
- **Direct SQL Access & Complex Queries**: When you need to perform complex SQL queries, optimizations, and have direct database access for intricate operations.
  
- **Interoperability with Diverse Systems**: If your ecosystem consists of diverse non-Microsoft tools, and integration between them and the database is crucial.

- **High Transaction Rates**: If your operations involve a very high number of transactions per second and demand impeccable performance at scale.
  
- **Very Large Datasets**: When dealing with extensive datasets that require intricate management, optimizations, and storage solutions.
