Be prepared for the initial meeting because first impressions are the most important. Preparation cements your professionalism and underscores your eye for detail and capacity to deliver.

<!--endintro-->

Preparing for the meeting includes:

* Ensuring the sales staff attending the meeting are familiar with the relevant technologies
* Reviewing the clients' website or other available information, taking special note of the nature of the client's business. It's also useful to remember the office locations (e.g. one office, nationwide or international) and the year of commencement of business
* Reviewing any specification documents the client may have provided.
* Having a wireless card to access the Internet if you cannot connect to the clients network. In fact, it is preferred you do not connect to the clients network due to time and security issues
* Having the [Standard Sales Presentation](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Rules.Content/raw/main/rules/meetings-are-you-prepared-for-the-initial-meeting/SSW-SalesMarketing.pptx). Remember, while clients don't want to think this is your first job, they rarely like to listen to how many CommBanks, NRMAs or Pfizers you've done work for. Clients generally prefer the focus of the meeting to be their business. You will however consider any previous projects which bear similarities to the project on offer, you do need to prove our competency
* Have all the information that was recorded during the [initial call](/be-prepared-for-inbound-calls)
* A hard copy of the [Consulting Order Terms and Conditions](https://www.ssw.com.au/SSW/Standards/Forms/ConsultingOrderTermsConditions.aspx) may be useful for them to review when the meeting is concluded
* Plenty of business cards (that haven't been sitting in your wallet for three months!)
* Use ChatGPT or a similar AI service to help you think of questions that are relevant to your project's technology. Try our new GPT, SIMP (SSW Initial Meeting Pro) for an easy and efficient way to prepare: https://chat.openai.com/g/g-PlDXigpe3-simp-ssw-initial-meeting-pro
* Turning up early!
