Date formats should always be kept consistent across applications. More importantly, they should be kept consistent with the operating system's regional settings, otherwise this will cause significant confusion for users.

The best way to do this in your code is to grab the culture information from the application thread and use it to automatically format your Datetime data type. Do not use hard coded datetime formatting strings unless it's absolutely necessary.

```dotnet
startTimeTextBox.Text = resultResults.StartTime.ToString("dd/MM/yyyy hh:mm:ss");
```

```dotnet

'Initial CultureInfo settings for the application
Public initialCulture As CultureInfo
...

...
txtDateCreate.Text = CType(txtDateCreate.Tag, System.DateTime).ToString(initialCulture.DateTimeFormat)
```

## Browser language settings

It is required to set web browser language to English (Australia) after modifying the computer reginal and language settings. This ensures proper formatting and compatibility, particularly when downloading web pages or accessing specific web content. 

For example, Power BI is date format agnostic and will honor the setting in your browser. If your browser language is set to US English, it may cause date formatting issues.

Go to **Browser Settings | Language | Select English (Australia)** as the top priority language:
