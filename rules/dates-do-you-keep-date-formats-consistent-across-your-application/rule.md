Date formats should always be kept consistent across your application, more importantly,                      it should be kept consistent with the operating system's regional settings otherwise                      this will cause significant confusion for your users.

The best way to do this in your code is to grab the culture information from the application thread and use it to automatically format your Datetime data type. Do not use hard coded datetime formatting strings unless it's absolutely necessary.


```
startTimeTextBox.Text = resultResults.StartTime.ToString("dd/MM/yyyy hh:mm:ss");
```

```
'VB.NET
'Initial CultureInfo settings for the application
Public initialCulture As CultureInfo
...
...
txtDateCreate.Text = CType(txtDateCreate.Tag, System.DateTime).ToString(initialCulture.DateTimeFormat)
```
