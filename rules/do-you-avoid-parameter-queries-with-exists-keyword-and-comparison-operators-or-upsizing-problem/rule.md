The MS Upsizing Wizard cannot upsize Microsoft Access queries containing

* EXISTS &lt;&gt; FALSE/TRUE or
* EXISTS = FALSE/TRUE


For example, the following query will not be upsized:

<!--endintro-->


```
PARAMETERS [@Employee Last Name] Text ( 20 );    
SELECT Orders.OrderID
, Orders.CustomerID
, Orders.EmployeeID
FROM Orders
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT EmployeeID
 FROM Employees 
 WHERE LastName= [@Employee Last Name] 
 AND Employees.EmployeeID=Orders.EmployeeID) <> FALSE
```

```

In order to get the good example syntax you must switch from Design View window to SQL View in query designer window and save query definition.
