<p>In a wizard, a visual indication about the progress should be 
provided so users know where they are up to. It should also let the user
 know which steps have been completed and how far to go.</p><p>A good way to do this is use a left navigation bar with <strong>bold</strong> on the step they are currently at.</p>
