SEO means working with a large amount of data. A single website can have even up to thousands of subpages, keywords, and internal links. If it’s operating in a competitive industry, it needs external links from thousands of domains. What if you’re optimizing several websites? The result? The era of Big Data in SEO.

#### What can (and should) be monitored in SEO

1. **Organic traffic** - Keep a close eye on the organic traffic your website is attracting
2. **Availability (Uptime)** - Ensure your website is consistently accessible to users
3. **Loading speed** - Page speed matters for both user experience and search engine rankings
4. **Correct functioning** - Regularly check for any issues affecting the proper functioning of your website
5. **Domain and SSL certificate expiration** - Stay on top of domain and SSL certificate renewals to avoid interruptions
6. **Blacklist status** - Ensure your website isn't listed on any blacklists, which can harm your reputation
7. **Robot blockers** - Check for any factors that might be blocking search engine bots from indexing your content
