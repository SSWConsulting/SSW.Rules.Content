Sometimes you send an email and get a response saying it's too cryptic. Never assume that others will understand you anyways. When sending an email it's very important to add context and reasoning, and make yourself as clear as possible. This way anyone can understand your content at any time in the future. 

Also make sure to always [keep the history of an email](/keep-email-history), so there are enough details in the thread for anyone else to acknowledge what is going on.

A nice way to provide extra clear information is by [adding links](/dones-do-your-dones-include-a-url) and [screenshots with useful captions](/add-useful-and-concise-figure-captions).

### What if you receive a cryptic email?
The most productive way to understand a confusing email is to [seek clarification with a call](/seek-clarification-via-phone).
