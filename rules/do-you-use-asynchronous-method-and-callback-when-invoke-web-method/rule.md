Web service and web invoking becomes more and more popular today as the distributed systems are widely deployed. However, the normal method invoking may cause a disaster when apply to web method because transmitting data over Internet may cause your program to hang for a couple of minutes.   
<!--endintro-->
         private static string LoadContentFromWeb(string strUri) 

     { 
     ... 

WebResponse response = request.GetResponse(); 

     ...
     }      Figure: Invoke web method by the normal way (Bad - because this will hang your UI thread)   
The correct way to invoke web method is using asynchronous call to send a request and use the delegated CallBack method to read the response, see code below:
       public static void GetOnlineVersionAsync(string strUri) 
     { 
         try
         {
          ...

IAsyncResult r = request.BeginGetResponse(new AsyncCallback(ResCallBack), request);
          }
          catch(WebException ex)
         {
             Console.WriteLine(ex.ToString()) ; 
          }
     }



     private static void ResCallBack(IAsyncResult ar)
     {
        try
        {
      string content = string.Empty;

          WebRequest req = (WebRequest)ar.AsyncState;

          WebResponse response = req.EndGetResponse(ar);

           ...

           RaiseOnProductUpdateResult(content);

        }
        catch(WebException ex)
        {
           Console.WriteLine(ex.ToString());
           RaiseOnProductUpdateResult(string.Empty);
         }
     }      Figure: Invoke web method by using asynchronous method and CallBack (Good - UI thread will be free once the request has been sent)   
When working with Web Service, asynchronous methods will be automatically generated by your web services proxy.
