Manually typing out meeting notes is slow, error-prone, and distracting. While you’re typing, you’re likely missing parts of the discussion and contributing less. Worse, you might spend time afterward cleaning up notes instead of acting on them. 

In fact, employees estimate that 37% of their biggest cost is wasted time in meetings, and context-switching after interruptions takes an average of 9 minutes to recover from. Manual note-taking multiplies both problems.

### Why manual notes fall short

* **❌ You fall behind:** Fast conversations are hard to track while you type.
* **❌ You lose focus:** Note-takers often miss critical context or fail to contribute.
* **❌ You waste recovery time:** Switching between listening and typing is cognitively expensive.
* **❌ You still have to format, organize, and send the notes afterward.
