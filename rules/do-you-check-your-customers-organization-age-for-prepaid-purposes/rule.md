​​It is essential to be familiar with your organization's&#160;Terms &amp; Conditions, as it may impact the way you invoice.&#160;<a href="https&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Forms/ConsultingOrderTermsConditions.aspx">SSW Ter​ms &amp; Conditions</a>&#160;allow&#160;SSW to invoice on a Prepaid basis as per part '6 - Pre-Paid Work' &amp; '19 - Payment Terms'.&#160;<br><br><p>It is also highly recommended&#160;to invoice customers, who have been in existence for less than 2 years on a prepaid basis. It may, however, be an awkward conversation or irrelevant on the customer's behalf to ask of their organization's age in an initial meeting.&#160; Instead, you can perform an <a href="https&#58;//connectonline.asic.gov.au/RegistrySearch">ASIC Company Search​</a>&#160;to determine the customer's organization age.<br></p>
