It's great when someone can solve problems quickly and professionally. However, the knowledge and skills on how to solve problems related to the role needs to be documented so anyone can follow.

Keep that knowledge in the cloud and create procedures that can be shared to individuals who might not have your knowledge and experience.

This can be beneficial in different ways:

- **Continuity:** When knowledge is tied to a role, it is less likely to be lost if the person in that role leaves the organization. This helps to ensure that essential processes and procedures continue to be carried out effectively
- **Scalability:** By keeping knowledge in the cloud, it becomes easier to train new hires or skill up a team. Rather than relying on the expertise of a single individual, the organization can draw on a shared pool of knowledge and skills
- **Resilience:** It helps to create a more resilient organization, as the loss of a key individual will have less of an impact. This can help to mitigate risks and minimize disruption
- **Transferability:** It becomes easier to transfer knowledge to other individuals within the organization. This can help to foster a culture of learning and continuous improvement

Keep in mind that every task is tied to a role, a position or a duty, rather than a specific person. This ensures that the organization has access to the knowledge it needs to achieve its goals and objectives, even as personnel change over time.
