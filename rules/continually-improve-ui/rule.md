As the web development industry matures, best practices of website usability are continually improving. You should regularly update your website's user interface to reflect these changes. Good examples are breadcrumbs (seen at the top of this page) and cascading menus. Not only are these features an easy way to find what you want and know where you currently are in a website hierarchy, there are also standards that users are becoming familiar with.
