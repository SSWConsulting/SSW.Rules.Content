Whenever you're doing something more than once there should be a clear procedure. We call them “standards” or “rules”. That means that there should be lots of standards.

**Standards should \*not\* be followed blindly. Aim for continual improvement.**

There are pros and cons to having standards:

<!--endintro-->

**The pros:**

- They help speed up the decision making process – getting you to the best decision faster
- They help maintain [consistency](/do-you-understand-the-value-of-consistency)

**The cons:**

- They take time to write in a generic fashion
- Technological rules rust easily. Technologies and techniques change often, so you must be on the lookout for the new and better approaches and continually update these
- They have errors as they are written by imperfect people
- People will sometimes follow an inappropriate rule. A set of rules can never predict every path, so cases can and will appear that the standards fail to cater for

**Standards should always help the critical thinking process, but never replace it.**

If you think something can be done better or the standard is simply out of date, you should improve the standard. This is best done as a team effort with everyone making little changes often. Whenever you come across a standard which needs updating or improving you have three options:

1. [Fix it yourself straight away](/fix-small-web-errors) by [editing the rule](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Rules.Content/wiki/How-to-Edit-Rules) (preferred)
2. Fix it yourself later if it's too big. In this case, [send yourself an email](/dones-do-you-send-yourself-emails)
3. Ask someone else to fix it following the [change "x" to "y"](/do-you-ask-for-content-changes-using-from-x-to-y)

**Never** ignore a potential improvement or expect someone else to work on it.
