<span class='intro'> <p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">A buyer persona is, according to&#160;Hub​Spot, a semi-fictional representation of your ideal customer. It's based on market research, actual data about your existing customers, and a few (educated) assumptions. It helps you to understand and relate to an audience that you want to market your products and services to.&#160;​<br></p> </span>

<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​When creating your buyer persona, you should include customer demographics, behavior patterns, motivations, and goals. The more specific you can be, the better. Variations of your buyer persona would also help understand and shape strategy and communication to sell your service/product, for example&#58; &quot;Can only men purchase my product? Or women too? Or maybe children eventually? How old can they be? Are they only local? Can I consider selling it to other states?&quot;<br></p><dl class="image"><dt><img src="buyer-persona-example.png" alt="buyer-persona-example.png" style="width&#58;750px;" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Example of questions you need to answer in order to identify your buyer persona​<br></dd></dl>
