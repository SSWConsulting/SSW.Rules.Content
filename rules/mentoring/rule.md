Trying to do great things is hard. Trying to do them alone is, more often than not, impossible. That’s why all great leaders have mentors, and they also mentor others. No matter how competitive you may feel - especially early in your career - success is, in reality, a team sport. 

Steve Jobs had Bill Campbell as a mentor; Mark Zuckerberg had Steve Jobs; Bill Gates had Warren Buffett... the great Robert De Niro had Stella Adler; even Nelson Mandela had Ganghi to guide him! These are all very successful people, who benefited from having someone to lean on professionally. 

Having a mentor will give you an advantage over those who have to navigate and manoeuvre the IT industry alone.  This is true of any industry. It also doesn't have to be someone showing you how to do something technical, your mentor doesn't even have to be someone more senior - they just need to be good at something you are not. If they are an expert in something you don't know how to do - they can be your mentor. 

⭐ Great mentors should: 

* Push you out of your comfort zone
* Give you great feedback and encouragement
* Be a confidant when times are tough
* Care about your success
* Be a positive role model
* Dedicate some time just for you
* Be life-long learners
* Be open and honest
