There's a few types of mentoring:

* **Consulting mentoring** where you hire people because you don't have the skills within your company (can be an all day engagement) e.g. SSW's Mentoring Services (TODO: add link to SSW mentoring)

Or if you have the skills within your company, then you can up-skill people using the brains of your own company.

* **Ad-hoc mentoring** (informal) where you get advice when you need it
* **Scheduled mentoring** (aka. formal), when you book in meetings and make a plan

## Who mentors who?

You can be a senior mentoring a junior. You can be a junior mentoring someone more senior. Everyone has something they can teach, or that they can learn! Being a mentor will make you a better consultant, so you should think about what you can teach others.

## What do I get mentored on?

There are many different kinds of mentors, some are for soft skills, some are for technical skills. You may already know what you would like to be mentored in, however you really should ask your peers what they think you should be mentored on. You could have a blind spot. Here's how to approach it:

* Approach the people you trust, and ask them what you should be mentored in
* Brainstorm ideas and jot them down
* See what pops up the most - and start there
* Approach someone you know is good at that thing to be your mentor.

Here are some of the things you can learn:

* Public Speaking
* Developing a great I.T. career
* Account Management
* Low Code
* Clean Architecture
* Angular
* Great blogging
* Increasing your social media presence 

## How does it work?

Once you've got your mentor, book in x3 monthly mentoring sessions to work on your target area. They will work like an accountability buddy. Knowing that you have to check-in with your mentor every month for 3 months, will help motivate you to work hard on improving in your target area.

### 1st Meeting

* Tell the mentor what you would like to achieve by the end of the 3 months
* Work out your goals & set targets
* Then the mentee works independently for a month, checking-in when needed

### 2nd Meeting

* The Mentor will review their progress and give tips or suggestions on how to move forward
* Set new goals
* Then the mentee works independently for a month, checking-in when needed

### 3rd Meeting

* The Mentor will review their progress and give tips or suggestions on how to move forward
* Set some longer-term goals
* Then the mentee works independently, checking in when needed informally
