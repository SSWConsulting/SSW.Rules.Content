Trying to do great things is hard. Trying to do them alone is, more often than not, impossible. That’s why all great leaders have mentors, and they also mentor others. No matter how competitive you may feel - especially early in your career - success is, in reality, a team sport. 

Steve Jobs had Bill Campbell as a mentor; Mark Zuckerberg had Steve Jobs; Bill Gates had Warren Buffett... 

⭐ Great mentors should: 

* Push you out of your comfort zone
* Give you great feedback and encouragement
* Be a confidant when times are tough
* Care about your success
* Be a positive role model
* Dedicate some time just for you
* Be life-long learners
* Be open and honest

Mentoring doesn't have to be technical. You might like to learn about Account Management, or public speaking...  I'd like to think that I'm mentoring all the time, and that you can come to me with stuff you need help with. I also have you to learn from, but I've never had anything formal in place! I think anyone can be a mentor.... but I'd like to hear your thoughts.
