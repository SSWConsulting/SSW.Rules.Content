<span class='intro'> To get the most out of your communications, your writing should be compelling and direct.&#160;The best way to ensure this is to use active voice.&#160;<div><br><div>​For example&#58;<br></div></div> </span>

<div>​<p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">When the CD is inserted, a Windows dialog will be shown.</p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad">Figure&#58; Bad Example - This example is using a passive voice, and&#160;does not address the reader or from the point of the subject (the software in this case).</dd><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">When you insert a CD, Windows shows a dialog.</p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Figure&#58; Good Example - This example uses the active voice to&#160;address the reader, and is more direct and engaging.</dd><div><br></div><div>An easy way to tell if you're using the passive voice is to add &quot;by zombies&quot; after verb.
