Any time you're building or changing something that users interact with, you should get a **UI/UX Test Please** from a designer. This ensures your work looks clean, feels intuitive, and aligns with the overall user experience.

<!--endintro-->

## Why it matters

- Designers catch visual issues, alignment problems, and inconsistent spacing  
- They help ensure the flow is clear, especially across different devices  
- A second set of eyes avoids awkward interactions or confusing layouts  

## Common examples that need a UI/UX Test Please
- Buttons, inputs, tooltips, and menus
- Layout changes, like [spacing tweaks](/format-new-lines) and and alignment fixes
- Mobile [responsiveness](/responsive-design) 
- Error messages, or loading indicators  
- Icons, font sizes, or colors  
- Images or graphics

## How to do it

1. Start with the right approach:
   - For **small and straightforward updates**, complete your work and test it yourself
   - For **more complex changes** (like new flows, layout ideas, or interaction patterns), first have a quick conversation with a designer
     - Explain your idea and what you're trying to achieve  
     - Get early feedback before building anything. This helps avoid wasted effort on ideas that may not work well for users  

2. Send a quick “UI/UX Test Please” with a video, screenshot or link  
3. Chase up designer for feedback 
4. Apply any suggestions and get a "✅ Test Pass"
5. Go live  

> Great UX is a team effort. Always get a design review before it reaches users.
