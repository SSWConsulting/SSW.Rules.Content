Any time you're building or changing something that users interact with, you should get a **UI/UX Test Please** from a designer. This ensures your work looks clean, feels intuitive, and aligns with the overall user experience.

<!--endintro-->

## Why it matters

- Designers catch visual issues, alignment problems, and inconsistent spacing  
- They help ensure the flow is clear, especially across different devices  
- A second set of eyes avoids awkward interactions or confusing layouts  

## Common examples that need a UI/UX Test Please
- New buttons, inputs, or dropdowns  
- Layout changes or [spacing tweaks](/format-new-lines)  
- Modals, tooltips, tabs, or sliders  
- Mobile responsiveness and alignment fixes  
- Empty states, error messages, or loading indicators  
- Changes to icons, font sizes, or colors  

## How to do it

1. Start with the right approach:
   - For **small and straightforward updates**, complete your work and test it yourself
   - For **more complex changes** (like new flows, layout ideas, or interaction patterns), first have a quick conversation with a designer
     - Explain your idea and what you're trying to achieve  
     - Get early feedback before building anything. This helps avoid wasted effort on ideas that may not work well for users  

2. Send a quick “UI/UX Test Please” with a video, screenshot or link  
3. Wait for feedback and apply any suggestions before going live  

> Great UX is a team effort. Always get a design review before it reaches users.
