Amazon's Swedish website accidentally replaced "rooster" with the Swedish word for male genitals. An Italian company named their international site `powergenitalia.com` instead of `powergen-italia.com` back in 2003. These weren't just translation mistakes, they were internationalization disasters that exposed fundamental marketing failures.

The companies that succeed globally ([Spotify](https://www.nimdzi.com/lessons-in-localization-spotify-expanded), Netflix, Uber) don‚Äôt just translate. They design from day one for cultural, linguistic, and technical differences.

## The expensive confusion: i18n vs l10n

### **Internationalization** (i18n) - The architecture

The word ‚Äúinternationalization‚Äù is long, so we shorten it to **i18n** because there are 18 letters between the ‚Äúi‚Äù and ‚Äún.‚Äù  According to the W3C, internationalization means **designing your product so it can easily adapt to different languages and cultures** before you start translating.  

Think of it like **building a website with a flexible backend**. You set up your framework so it supports multiple languages: text is not hardcoded, date and currency formats can be customized, and layouts can adjust for right-to-left text.  

You are not adding translations yet. You are just making sure the system can handle them later without breaking.  

### **Localization** (l10n) - The implementation

If i18n is the framework, **l10n** is when you actually **fill in the details for each locale**. This is where you add translations, apply regional settings, and adjust visuals such as date formats, currencies, or culturally specific images.  

This step is where you confirm that your internationalized website truly works for users in Japan, Germany, or Brazil, and fix anything that does not fit.

## Common i18n issues and tips

Here are the most frequent pitfalls developers encounter when scaling globally:

1. **UX - No language options** - Users are stuck with 1 language  

   ‚úÖ Provide a language selector (see rule [Do you always give the user an option to change the locale?](/do-you-always-give-the-user-an-option-to-change-the-locale/))

2. **Character encoding** - All countries using non-latin scripts (japanese, chinese, korean, etc.). E.g. ‚ÄúBj√∂rk‚Äù becomes ‚ÄúBj?rk‚Äù in Sweden; or " Áî∞‰∏≠„Åï„Çì " turns into ‚Äú???‚Äù in Japanese.

   ‚ùå Don't make assumptions about ASCII-only inputs  
   ‚úÖ Use UTF-8 end-to-end (DB, API, frontend)
  
3. **Dates & numbers** - ‚Äú03/04/2025‚Äù means "March 4" in the US and "April 3" in Europe. Decimal points and commas vary by region and can cost money

   ‚ùå Don‚Äôt parse strings manually  
   ‚úÖ Use `Intl.DateTimeFormat`, `Intl.NumberFormat` or libraries like [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/)  

4. **UX - Text expansion and contraction** - German words can be 30‚Äì40% longer, while Chinese can compress paragraphs into a handful of characters  

   ‚ùå Don‚Äôt hardcode pixel widths for buttons or labels  
   ‚úÖ Use flex layouts, `min-width`, `word-break`  

5. **Names & forms** - Some cultures have one name, some have none that fit ‚Äúfirst/last‚Äù (i.e. Indonesia, Tibet)

   ‚ùå Don't force ‚ÄúFirst Name / Last Name‚Äù globally  
   ‚úÖ Use a single ‚ÄúFull Name‚Äù field, or make name parts optional  

7. **Infrastructure blind spots** - Networks too slow, CDNs not present where your customers are

   ‚ùå Don‚Äôt ship a 5MB JS bundle to mobile-first markets  
   ‚úÖ [Use a CDN close to your users](/use-a-cdn/)  
   ‚úÖ In China, use local CDNs to avoid latency from the Great Firewall  
   ‚úÖ Subset fonts or use system fonts

8. **Cultural symbols** - White means purity in the West, but death in China. Even colors can alienate users  

   ‚ùå Don‚Äôt assume Western metaphors apply everywhere  
   ‚úÖ Test color/icon choices with local users (white = death in China)  b

9. **RTL layouts** - For instance, Arabic language flip entire UI structures, not just text direction (see image below)

   ‚úÖ Test with `direction: rtl;`  
   ‚úÖ Use a combination of  logical CSS properties (`direction: rtl;`) instead of `left`/`right`

   ::: info
   **Tip:**" Arabic accounts for 5% of internet users (300M+). Supporting RTL ("Right-To-Left") means mirroring the entire UI, not just text

## Traditional i18n approach

### Option A - Rely on Google Translate (0 effort)

Users can rely on Google Translate in their browser if implementation time is lacking.

#### ‚úÖ Pros

* Immediate availability with zero development effort  
* No implementation or maintenance costs

#### ‚ùå Cons

* Poor user experience and unprofessional appearance  
* Inaccurate translations and broken UI elements  
* Potential loss of international users  

### Option B - Implement i18n libraries

Use standard i18n tools (see below) with an internal translation workflow.  

#### ‚úÖ Pros

* High-quality, controlled translations  
* Professional multilingual user experience  
* Native language support and better SEO  
* Full control of data

#### ‚ùå Cons

* Significant development time and delays  
* High translation costs: 0.08‚Äì0.15 $AUD per word for professional translators (potentially ‚Ç¨5,000‚Äì15,000+ per language for a typical app)  
* Ongoing costs for maintaining and updating translations with each new feature  
* Complex maintenance of language files  
* Slow update process for new content  

### Useful non-AI tools

* **[i18next](https://www.i18next.com/)** (JS/React): Manages translations and language switching  
* **[FormatJS](https://formatjs.io/)**: Dates, numbers, and message formatting  
* **[Globalize.js](https://github.com/globalizejs/globalize)**: Number/date formatting, message translation, plurals  
* **[Angular i18n](https://angular.dev/guide/i18n) / [ngx-translate](https://github.com/ngx-translate/core)**: First-class localization for Angular apps, see Rule [Do you add multilingual support (Angular)](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/add-multilingual-support-on-angular/)

## AI-tools

### Exploring AI agents in i18n

Internationalizing an app after you‚Äôve hardcoded strings everywhere is one of the toughest real-world i18n challenges. In this video, Ben Morss shows how **AI agents** can scan your codebase, create i18n keys, and automate translations.

**Video: Apidays Munich 2025 - AI translation + AI agents = i18n made easy By Ben Morss - watch from 8:10 to 16:40 (8 min)**

In this part, Ben Morss shows how an AI agent can internationalize a monolingual site by:

* Scanning the codebase to detect hardcoded strings
* Proposing i18n keys and replacing literals with t() function calls
* Generating JSON resource files and populating them with translations
* Opening a pull request so humans can review and approve

### Choosing the right i18n strategy by project size

Your i18n strategy should match your project‚Äôs size, requirements, and resources. Use the guide below to find the best fit.

#### 1. Small project - Essentials (POC)  

**Use case:** Quick prototypes, one-person projects, proof-of-concepts.  
**Approach:** Minimal setup. Extract strings, machine translate, quick human check.  
**Stack:** use traditional non-AI i18n approaches.  

‚úÖ Cheap, fast, avoids future i18n debt  
‚ùå Manual releases, limited scalability, brand/tone risks  

#### 2. Medium project - Step further with TMS  

**Use case:** Multi-language app with a small team, growing product with consistent branding needs.  
**Approach:** Add a lightweight Translation Management System (TMS) like [Phrase](https://phrase.com/), [Lokalise](https://lokalise.com/), or [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/). Enables glossary, screenshots, workflows.  
**Stack:** TMS + pseudolocalization tests.  

‚úÖ Centralized management, easier scaling, better consistency  
‚ùå Licensing costs, more process overhead  

#### 3. Large project - AI in CI/CD

**Use case:** SaaS products with frequent releases, multiple languages, distributed dev teams.  
**Approach:** Automate translations in the build pipeline. Machine translate ‚Üí AI QA pass ‚Üí human spot-check ‚Üí auto-commit.  
**Stack:** CI/CD pipeline + TMS + LLM QA.  

‚úÖ 80/20 automation, faster releases, consistent quality  
‚ùå Needs strong CI/CD setup, token costs, prompt governance  

#### 4. Enterprise project - Full-blown live LLM translation  

**Use case:** UGC-heavy platforms, fast-changing content, global e-commerce.  
**Approach:** Dynamic runtime translations (best for User-Generated Content, long-tail docs). Cache aggressively and use guardrails.  
**Stack:** LLM API + caching + glossary/do-not-translate rules.  

‚úÖ Instant coverage, great for user content and fast-changing text  
‚ùå Latency, cost variability, SEO/quality risks, heavy monitoring needed
