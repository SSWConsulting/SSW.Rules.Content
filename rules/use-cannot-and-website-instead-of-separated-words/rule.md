Grammatically, all of them are acceptable spellings, but in these specific cases, one word is more usual. Refer to [AskOxford](http&#58;//www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/cannot)for reference.

Note: When there are two ways of doing something, we make a rule on it one way with the goal of having complete consistency.
