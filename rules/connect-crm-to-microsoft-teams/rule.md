If you use a Team per client, it is likely that you want to have a link between your Teams instances and the associated CRM record.

<!--endintro-->

At SSW we have a custom property for each client that stores the Teams URL:

![Figure: CRM | Company/Account Form â€“ added Teams URL field](dynamics-and-teams.png)

### Simple:

To get that URL, simply click the ellipsis next to your Team name and click "Get link to Team"

### Medium:

**TODO: Lu to update**

Add a button to the Ribbon to provision a new team and link to it 

![Figure: Use the Ribbon]()

### Optimal (Recommended)

Using a PCF control you can add a button directly into the form that can do everything for you. 

Click on this section on your CRM Dynamics to have a Team created:

Alternatively, this process can even be automated using Azure functions and Graph API to provision a new Team every time a new client is created in CRM.
