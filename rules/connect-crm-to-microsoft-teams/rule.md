Microsoft Teams is a great solution for organizing client files and conversations. Create a new Team for each of your clients, and if you have multiple projects for one client, use Channels to keep them separate. There's no need to create a new Team just for a new project.

Once you have this set up, it is likely that you want to have a link between your Teams instances and the associated CRM record.

<!--endintro-->

At SSW we have a custom property for each client that stores the Teams URL:

**NOTE:** Each client should have its own Team. You might have two associated clients - e.g. Northwind Australia and Northwind USA - but if they are separate legal entities and have separate accounts in CRM, they should have separate Teams.

### Level 1: Manual

To get that URL, simply click the ellipsis next to your Team name and click "Get link to Team"

### Level 2: Automatic (Basic)

Add a button to the Ribbon to provision a new team and link to it

### Level 3: Automatic (Advanced - best UX)

Using a PCF control you can add a button directly into the form that can do everything for you. 

Click on this section on your CRM Dynamics to have a Team created:

Alternatively, this process can even be automated using Azure functions and Graph API to provision a new Team every time a new client is created in CRM.
