  <p>A task should never take more than a day (8 hours) to be completed.</p>

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <p>If you have a big task, which takes more the 4 hours, you might consider breaking it in sub-tasks. In case the estimate has changed during the sprint, the “Remaining Hours” field must be update in order to have an accurate Burndown chart.</p>
<p>The reason scrum limits the maximum hours is because you should always know in which task you are working and we don’t believe one single action can take that long.</p>
