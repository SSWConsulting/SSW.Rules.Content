  <p>A task should never have an estimate of more than half&#160;a day (4​ hours). ​
<br></p>

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <p>If you have a big task with an estimate of more the 4 hours, you should consider breaking it in sub-tasks. In case the estimate has changed during the sprint, the “Remaining Hours” field must be updated in order to have an accurate Burndown chart.</p>
<p>The reason Scrum limits the maximum hours is because you should always know in which task you are working and we believe one single action that takes more than 4 hours might be too generic.
