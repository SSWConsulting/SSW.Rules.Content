<span class='intro'> <p>​​Managers should regularly check to see if developers are committing their changes into source control. In TFS you can only get a status by manually looking at each project or running &quot;tfs status&quot; command. A great tool is <a href="http&#58;//visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/c255a1e4-04ba-4f68-8f4e-cd473d6b971f">Attrice Team Foundation SideKicks</a> which can display the status of all users and projects </p> </span>

<dd>Figure&#58; Use TFS Sidekicks and search for files older than 48 hours to find the naughty boys. </dd>
<dd>Suggestion for TFS Sidekicks&#58; Add a button to “Email all people their shame list”…. showing their files that are still checked out (until then I do it manually)</dd></dl>
