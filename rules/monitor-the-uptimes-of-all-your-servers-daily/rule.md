It is important that the system administrator can easily find out how reliable his servers are. This can be achieved using tools like What's Up Gold https://www.whatsupgold.com to monitor many statistics e.g.:

* Uptime - Ping, Interface monitor
* Performance - RAM usage, CPU usage
* Network - Bandwidth, Interface throughput
* Storage - Disk usage, health

For example, here is a report that SSW uses to monitor their servers on a daily basis.

It is also possible to use SQL Reporting Services to create a custom report that can be emailed via a data-driven subscription, which sends a nicely formatted email when there's a problem.
