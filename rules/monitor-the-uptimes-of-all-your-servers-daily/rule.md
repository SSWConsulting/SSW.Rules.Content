It is important that the system administrator can easily find out how reliable his servers are. This can be achieved using tools like What's Up Gold (WUG) <https://www.whatsupgold.com> to monitor many statistics e.g.:

- Uptime - Ping, Interface monitor
- Performance - RAM usage, CPU usage
- Network - Bandwidth, Interface throughput
- Storage - Disk usage, health

For example, here is a report in WhatsUp Gold you can use to monitor servers on a daily basis.

Another option is to use WUG's built-in email alerts, which can be formatted in HTML or plain text. You can also add variables that change based on the current state of devices and other stats.

The best option is to use SQL Reporting Services to create a custom report that can be emailed via a data-driven subscription, which sends a nicely formatted email when there's a problem.
