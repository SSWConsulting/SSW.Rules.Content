When want to show an image from the web on your website, the easiest way is to just copy the image's path and add it. This is not a good idea as the original host of the image can delete it, which will cause a broken image in your website.

<!--endintro-->

The right way to do this is to copy the image locally and upload to your own server, so you have total control over the image.

```html
<img
  src="https://some-external-url.com/images/open-extension.png"
  alt="Open extension"
/> 
<dd>Figure: Open extension</dd>
```

::: bad
Figure: Bad example - Using an external URL as image source. The image can be edited or deleted and there is nothing you can do about it
:::

```html
<img src="https://ssw.com.au/images/open-extension.png" alt="Open extension" /> 
<dd>Figure: Open extension</dd>
```

::: good
Figure: Good example - Image is hosted internally. You have control over the image
:::

**Note:** For copyrighted images, you should **always** mention the source.
