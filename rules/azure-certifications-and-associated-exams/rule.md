## Microsoft Certifications

Microsoft provides numerous certifications and training options to help you learn new skills, fill technical knowledge gaps, and prove your competence.

Certifications are broken up into Fundamentals, Role-based (Intermediate & Expert), and Specialty. Check the [Become Microsoft Certified poster](https://aka.ms/traincertposter) for details of exams required for each of the certifications, or [browse all certifications here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/browse/).

Focusing on Azure certifications, here are some good options:

### Fundamentals

If you're just getting started, take a look at [Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-fundamentals/). 

Earn this certification to prove you have a foundational knowledge of cloud services and how those services are provided with Microsoft Azure. You will need to pass the exam [AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900).

If AI is more your style, have a look at [Microsoft Certified: Azure AI Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals/)

Earn this certification to prove you have foundational knowledge of AI concepts related to the development of software and services of Microsoft Azure to create AI solutions. You will need to pass the exam [AI-900: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/ai-900).

### Associate

If you're already working with these technologies, you can skip the fundamentals and go for associate level certifications - see the role-based intermediate certifications in the poster above. Here are some examples:

Eventually, all rock star developers and solution architects should set their sights on expert exams.

### Foundations

If you're just starting out in GitHub, go for the [GitHub Foundations exam](https://examregistration.github.com/certification/GHF). This exam measures entry level skills with GitHub basics like repositories, commits, branching, markdowns, and project management.

### All Other Exams

All other exams are useful, depending on your focus/interest in GitHub.
