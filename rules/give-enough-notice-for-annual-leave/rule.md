<h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">
               ​​For Employees&#58;<br></h3><p>
               Tell your managers and co-workers as soon as you know when you will be away. If you're planning to be away for any substantial amount of time (say 3 days or more), make sure you have told everyone who will need to know about 4 weeks in advance whenever possible. Most importantly, ensure that your clients are not left in a difficult position while you are gone.

      <br></li></ul><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">For Employers&#58;</h3><p>Give your employees a bit of flexibility for small leav e periods (say 1-2 days). As an employer, you should allow these small periods of leave with little to no notice.<br>This will remove the incentive for employees to lie and say they are sick when they need time off with short notice.</p><dl class="image"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/BeachEnforcers.jpg" alt="BeachEnforcers.jpg" style="width&#58;650px;" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Did you give enough notice, or do we need to track you down?</dd></dl>​<br>
