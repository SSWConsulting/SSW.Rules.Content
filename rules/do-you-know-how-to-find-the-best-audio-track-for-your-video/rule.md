You can also find many great full-length songs that suit corporate video. However, the music style is typically geared towards online ads and marketing videos  and doesn't quite have that 'professional' sound you get from bands and mainstream artists. <br></p><dl class="goodImage"><dt> <img src="audio-video-good-audiojungle.jpg" alt="audio-video-good-audiojungle.jpg" /> </dt><dd> Good example: E.g.
