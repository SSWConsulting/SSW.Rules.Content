You can also find many great full-length songs that suit corporate video. However, the music style is typically geared towards online ads and marketing videos &#160;and doesn't quite have that 'professional' sound you get from bands and mainstream artists. <br></p><dl class="goodImage"><dt> <img src="audio-video-good-audiojungle.jpg" alt="audio-video-good-audiojungle.jpg" /> </dt><dd> Good example&#58; E.g.
