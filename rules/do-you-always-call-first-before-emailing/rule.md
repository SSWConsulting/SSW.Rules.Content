<p>​</p><p>Calling first can save valuable time versus waiting&#160;for someone to respond to your email, making you more productive. Calling first also&#160;saves time when discussing topics that are easier explained over the phone.&#160;​(<a href="/do-you-seek-clarification-via-the-telephone-first" style="color&#58;#cc4141;border-bottom-color&#58;#cc4141;line-height&#58;20.7999992370605px;">Do you seek clarification via the telephone first?&#160;​</a><span style="line-height&#58;20.7999992370605px;">​</span>)<br><br>When you need to contact someone&#160;the steps you should take are&#58;</p><p></p><ol><li><span style="line-height&#58;20.7999992370605px;">​Ping them on Skype asking &quot;Can I talk to&#160;you&quot;</span><br></li><li><span style="line-height&#58;20.7999992370605px;">Call them.&#160;</span></li><li><span style="line-height&#58;20.7999992370605px;"></span><span style="line-height&#58;20.7999992370605px;">If you do not get through, leave a&#160;<a href="/do-you-use-voice-recordings-when-appropriate">voice&#160;message​</a>​ and send an email starting with “As per the voicemail I left for you…​</span><br></li><li><span style="line-height&#58;20.7999992370605px;">After talking with the person&#160;follow up with an email that </span><a href="/do-you-send-＂as-per-our-conversation＂-emails" style="line-height&#58;20.7999992370605px;">begins with the words &quot;As per our conversation&quot;​</a><br></li></ol><p><span style="line-height&#58;20.7999992370605px;"><span style="line-height&#58;21px;">​<br></span></span>​It is very unlikely a client will complain because&#160;you contact them too often but it is likely they will if you only ever email, so do not be afraid of calling first before emailing.&#160;</p><div><span style="line-height&#58;21px;"><br></span></div>
