Before you do the task – say if the task requires a code change and you are using TFS, make sure it goes in as a work item.[Follow the rule to happy clients - triage rule](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=f1e392b8-3793-4e10-96a3-c32d0d0944b4).

After you do the task, the perfect workflow is to [follow the rule to better project management with TFS - use TeamCompanion to send your ‘done’ and reply ‘done – changeset xxx’](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterProjectManagementWithTFS.aspx#Send-Done-Email).
