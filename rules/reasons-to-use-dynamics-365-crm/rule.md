CRM is used to store and retrieve Client information, Opportunities, Projects, and Bookings.

<!--endintro-->



* **Contact details** - You can use the mobile app if you’re out and about to get contact details (mobile number, email, or address)
"What’s Mr. Northwind’s phone number?"
* **Finding out info** - View Power BI report to see who has been working for that client and when
"In the past year, who has worked for Mr. Northwind?"
* **Linking to the TimePro or Teams** locations for a client
"Mr. Northwind emailed me an important doc and I want to save it… Do they have an MS Team?"
* **Entering or updating Opportunity or Project data** (not Projects don't exist out of the box with CRM, but they’re easy customization to add)
"I have to enter a timesheet but there’s no project… where do I add one?"
* **User information** 
"What is JK’s default rate and Title?"
* **Booking** yourself for a client or leave (if you don’t have access to Outlook)
"I have to take tomorrow off but left my laptop at work… how can I put in leave?"
