<span class='intro'> <p>​​A team knows how many stories they can commit to by measuring their velocity.&#160;The Team estimates the highest priority stories in the Product Backlog in Story Points. ​It is very important for teams to estimate tasks effectively.&#160;There are several methods for estimating&#58; <br></p><ul><li>Shirt Sizes</li><li>Fibonacci Extended (1-100)</li><li>Fibonacci Original&#160;(1-21)</li><li>Doubling</li><li>Thr​own </li></ul>
 </span>

<p>Let's go through them&#58;</p><h3>Shirt Sizes</h3><p>This method is popular with Microsoft teams, but it has the problem of not easily mapping to the common 7 numbers when you enter it into a Task tracking Bug database. eg.</p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right&#58;0px;"><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">1 = XS<br>2 = S<br>4 = M<br>8 = L<br>16 = XL<br>32 = XXL<br>64 = XXXL​<br></p><p>
      <strong>​Please note&#58; </strong>In some teams which only use Small, Medium and Large the following numbering is applyed respectively​ 2, 4 and 8.​​<br></p></blockquote><dl class="badImage"><dt> <img class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" src="size-stories-bad-example.jpg" alt="" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Bad example - Estimation using T-Shirt sizes</dd></dl><h3>Fibonacci&#160;Extended (1-100)</h3><p>Planning Poker is a very effective Product Backlog estimation technique and the most common method is using Fibonacci numbers (1,2,3,5,8,13, etc.). This was made popular by Mike Cohn.</p><dl class="goodImage"><dt> <img class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" src="size-stories-ok-example.jpg" alt="" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; OK example - Estimation using Planning Poker with large numbers</dd></dl><h3>Fibonacci&#160;(1-21)</h3><p>Mike Cohn introduced changes to the original 7 cards, by changing&#160;the 21 to 20 and adding 40 and 100 to indicate very large user stories called Epics.</p><p>Ken Schwaber (the father of Scrum) says in his Scrum Certification course, that he is not a fan of the extra cards and says he prefers teams keep to the original 7 cards.</p><dl class="goodImage"><dt> <img class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" src="size-stories-good-example.jpg" alt="" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; OK example -&#160;Estimation using Planning Poker with only small numbers</dd></dl><h3>Doubling</h3><p>Estimating using doubling numbers makes relative sizing simple. An 8 point PBI should be about twice the size as a 4-point PBI. This method also&#160;simplifies PBI swapping where a PBI is&#160;replaced with PBIs totaling the same number of points.</p><p>It has one other advantage over the Fibonacci sequence, it is easier for non-techies because the numbers aren't whacky and the name isn't bizarre.</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox"><b>Estimate</b><br>1<br>2<br>4<br>8<br>16<br>32<br>64​<br></p>

<h3>Thrown</h3><p>Another method of estimating is the &quot;Thrown method&quot; as described Martin Fowler. <a href="http&#58;//martinfowler.com/bliki/ThrownEstimate.html">http&#58;//martinfowler.com/bliki/ThrownEstimate.html</a>&#160;</p><p>This is particularly useful if you don't have Planning Poker cards.&#160; Instead of Fibonacci numbers, estimates are from 1 to 5.&#160; It's nice and simple, and you only need the fingers on your hand.</p><p>The action is done in the same method as the game 'Rock, Paper, Scissors'. The options the developer can estimate is 1,2,3,4,5</p><dl class="image"><dt> <img class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" src="fist-method.jpg" alt="" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; User Story estimates using the &quot;Thrown method&quot;</dd></dl><h3>Other Tips<br></h3><p> 
   <strong>#1 Don't&#160;Shout Out</strong><br>It will just influence other people's votes.</p><p>
   <strong>#2 Guidelines for Estimating User Stories (aka Anchoring)</strong><br>Every team is different, but you can use the following guidelines for sizing User Stories.</p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right&#58;0px;"><div><table class="ms-rteCustom-SSWTable "><tbody><tr><td> 
                  <strong>Estimate Value</strong></td><td> 
                  <strong>Example User Story</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>A change to a message box<br></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>A timeboxed task for 1 day x 1 guy</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>A timeboxed task of 1 day x 2 guys</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>More than a month with a couple of guys.<br><b>Tip&#58; </b>Don't include these in a sprint because they are too risky - ask for them to be broken down.</td></tr></tbody></table></div>

   <strong>#3&#160;Using a Chat Program</strong><br>If you are working on a project with a remote team, use&#160;Skype chat&#160;to size stories using Planning Poker.&#160; Everyone should give their points for stories at the same time to avoid influencing each other.</p><p> 
   <strong>#4&#160;Big Stories Smell</strong><br>PBIs of greater than 1 day are a smell and PBIs greater than 2 days are a stench. If User Stories are estimated at more than&#160;1 or 2&#160;days of work, consider splitting them into smaller pieces to keep them under 1 or 2 days.&#160; See Do You Break Large Tasks into Smaller Tasks?</p><p> 
   <strong>#5 Use Spikes</strong><br>If you do find a very large User Story, consider using a Spike (aka. an investigation task) to help work out how much work will be involved.</p><p> 
   <strong>#6 Small stories</strong></p><p>As some stories can be obviously very small, we allow any member of the Team to propose that a Story is 0.5 points and no further discussion is required.&#160; If there is no objection (i.e. immediate consensus is reached) then the story is given 0.5 points and the Team move on to the next one.&#160; This is the only way a story can have only 0.5 points and always indicates that is was a quick decision and therefore may have some risk attached. <br></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Related rule</h3><ul><li>
