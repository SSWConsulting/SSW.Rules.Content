<span class='intro'> <p>
          In default view for Associated Contact you cannot see the email address, it would
          be better to customize it as an extra column.
        </p> </span>

<dl class="badImage">
          <dt>
            <img src="ContactView_NoEmail.jpg" alt="Associated Contact View without the email address" />
          </dt>
          <dd>
            Figure&#58; Associated Contact View without the email address</dd>
        </dl>
        <dl class="goodImage">
          <dt>
            <img src="ContactView_Email.jpg" alt="Associated Contact View with the email address" /></dt>
          <dd>
            Figure&#58; Associated Contact View with the email address</dd>
        </dl>
