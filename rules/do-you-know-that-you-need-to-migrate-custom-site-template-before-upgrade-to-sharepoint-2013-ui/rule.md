If you have “custom site template” for  your site, you can’t upgrade your site to the SharePoint 2013 UI unless you have a site template with the same name ready for new UI.

Figure:SharePoint will show you an error “Missing Site Templates” that prevents you from upgrading

<!--endintro-->

To fix this issue

1. Upgrade your site template’s  **content** files and  **definition** XML file to SharePoint 2013 (refer to SharePoint 2013 default site template for details).
2. Package the site template’s  **content** files to map location “ **{SharePointRoot}\Template\SiteTemplate** ”.

> 4.Deploy the package.
