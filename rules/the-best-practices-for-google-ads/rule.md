Do you know what the best practices are for Google Ads?

Here are the below are the best practices you should know:

* Time and pricing – Ensure time zone and currency are set up correctly!
* Define target location – choose a city, a region or a country according to your demographics. Try to avoid overlapping with the locations. Let's say you have two offices/stores in the same state, first, you will need to figure out what is the most relevant to define your targeted location. This will ensure better analytics for your campaigns
* Campaign name – Choose a name that clearly describes the focus of your campaign so that you can easily find it in your account
Note: Your campaign name isn't visible to your customers. Keep your campaign names consistent.
* Budget – Set a budget for each campaign based on needs
* Connect your account to Google Analytics. The Google Ads Conversion Tag should be the primary source for bidding data. Impact GA4 conversion for observations later down the line.
* Conversion – Utilise Value-Based Optimisation by tracking Dynamic COnversion Values. Implement Enhanced Conversions and Transaction IDs to ensure data durability and prevent over-counting.
* Keywords - aim for 5-20 keywords to avoid keyword stuffing
Note: You can start out with more keywords, then narrow it down to the best performing ones. Also don't forget to use a negative keyword strategy to save budget spend.
* Use ALL ad extensions available!
* Match type ad group strategy – Use similar & segmented keywords! Build small, tightly focused ad groups with a few (5-10) keywords
* Make sure you use enough headlines and good descriptions to improve the strength of your ad
* It's also a good idea to make an A/B test ad copy (split testing)
* Focus on clicks and impressions with CPC bidding
* A/B Testing – The AI system automatically runs thousands of creative "micro-experiments" by testing various asset combinations. Your role is to make the right call and maximise performance.
* Focus on Value with Smart Bidding – The gold standard is Maximize Conversion Value with Target ROAS (Return on Advertising Spend). Avoid Manual CPC, as AI-guided Smart Bidding is overwhelmingly superior for real-time, value-based optimisation.
* PMax - When running Performance Max (PMax), you must apply Exact Match negative keywords (especially for branded terms) to the PMax campaign to protect and prioritise high-value traffic in your traditional Search campaigns.
