Do you know what the best practices are for Google Ads?

Here are the below are the best practices you should know:

- Time and pricing – Ensure time zone and currency are set up correctly!
- Define target location – choose a city, a region or a country according to your demographics. Try to avoid overlapping with the locations. Let's say you have two offices/stores in the same state, first, you will need to figure out what is the most relevant to define your targeted location. This will ensure better analytics for your campaigns
- Campaign name – Choose a name that clearly describes the focus of your campaign so that you can easily find it in your account e.g. a keyword that you use for your product on your website or a special date like 'Valentine's day 2022'. Remember, your campaign name isn't visible to your customers. Keep your campaign names consistent so you follow the same structure for all of them
- Budget – Set a budget for each campaign based on needs
- Connect your account to Google Analytics. It’s important to check your customer journey (which is essential for remarketing actions!) to optimize your ads and your website/landing pages
- Conversion – Take advantage of conversion tracking
- Use ALL ad extensions available!
- Match type ad group strategy – Use similar & segmented keywords! Build small, tightly focused ad groups with a few (5-10) keywords
- Take advantage of audiences and exclusions choosing whoever is or is not your right audience
- Make sure you use enough headlines and good descriptions to improve the strength of your ad
- It's also a good idea to make an A/B test ad copy (split testing)
- Focus on clicks and impressions with CPC bidding
- Use high-quality optimised landing pages – make sure your website is mobile-friendly. Test your URL with this Google tool!
- Test your ads at least every fortnight, if possible one day a week. Use the tool Ad Preview and Diagnosis Tool and try different keywords and locations, depending on your business.
- Review the Search Terms Report
