<span class='intro'> <p>​Before you&#160;engage&#160;in any billable work, the two parties must enter into a binding
                    written contract. This ensures contractual obligations are clear on both sides,
                    mitigating the potential for disagreements down the line and protecting both you                   and the client in the event of a disagreement. Binding contracts can take the form
                    of Terms and Conditions, Emails and Instant Messenger or even verbal
                    agreements.
                <br></p> </span>

<ul>
                    <li><strong>Terms and Conditions</strong>
                    <p>
                        A signed copy of <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/SSW/Standards/Forms/ConsultingOrderTermsConditions.aspx">standard Terms and Conditions</a> are mandatory before billable work commences
                        as they explain the terms on which you&#160;work&#160;and the rates which will be billed.
                        Some clients may also have their own set of Terms and Conditions which you should&#160;consider signing if agreeable. It is also common for clients to ask you&#160;to
                        sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) which you should always consider.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Long term clients should re-sign the Terms and Conditions every couple of&#160;years. Signed Terms
                        and Conditions should be given to the&#160;Accounts department for record keeping.
                    </p>
                    
</li>
                    <li><strong>Proposals&#160;</strong><p>
                        At the conclusion of a <a href="http&#58;//sharepoint.ssw.com.au/Standards/Management/RulesToBetterProjectManagement/Pages/SpecificationReview.aspx">Specification Review</a>,&#160;you should&#160;provide a proposal to the client.&#160;This&#160;will include all of&#160;the relevant information
                        you&#160;have&#160;discovered during the Specification Review process. The proposal may take
                        the form of a PowerPoint presentation (preferred) or a Word doc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, the proposal is not a contract. It does not supersede the Terms and Conditions. In effect, 
                        the proposal is a sales document which describes broadly the scope of the work to be done and our                        capacity to complete that work.&#160;In an Agile project,&#160;it is not a working document from which the project is managed. 
                        The project will generally be managed using&#160;Scrum, with a backlog in TFS.</p>

                    <li><strong>Ad Hoc Emails, Instant Messenger and Verbal Agreements</strong>
                    <p>The most common form of mini-contract is a confirmation email.<br>​Electronic communication such as email and Instant Messenger are extremely useful
                        in getting decisions confirmed quickly but it is important to follow strict standards
                        to ensure any agreements are clear to everyone. You should not generally rely upon
                        verbal agreements, always confirming anything agreed verbally in writing. The following
                        are important rules to follow&#58;
                    </p></li>

                    prepare then confirm conversations/decisions?</a></li>

                    yourself emails?</a></li>
                <li><a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulestoBetterInstantMessenger.aspx#ImportantChatsEmail">
                    Do you confirm important IM chats by email</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Email, Instant Messenger and (confirmed) verbal agreements are utilized extensively
                during a project where newly discovered work, delays, or other work outside the
                initial scope is required.</p>
