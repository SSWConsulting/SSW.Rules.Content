<p>After a meeting, you should summarise the main issues and decisions of the meeting. The level of detail in the communication should suit the type of meeting, but should at least include a bullet point list of agenda items or any announcements made at the meeting. This can also serve as a reference for those who did attend the meeting.​</p>
