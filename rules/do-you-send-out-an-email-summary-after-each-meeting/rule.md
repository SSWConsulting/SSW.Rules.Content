After a meeting, you should summarise the main issues and decisions of the meeting, generating actionable tasks and delegating them to the appropriate person. The level of detail in the communication should suit the type of meeting, but should at least include a bullet point list of agenda items or any announcements made at the meeting.

This can also be used as a reference for those who did attend the meeting.
