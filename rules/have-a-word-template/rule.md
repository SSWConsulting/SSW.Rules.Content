A proposal template means that anyone in the company will be able to easily create a new proposal for a client following the standards. It also can literally cut the time of proposal development in half.

When creating the template, remember to add instructions to the user in yellow and check you are following "[SSW Rules to Better Proposals](/rules-to-better-proposals)".
