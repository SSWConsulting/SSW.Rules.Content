The easiest thing to do is to quote the price in your local currency. Go the extra step and convert it to a currency they understand.

If you are not sure what currency to use, just use US Dollars, which is the international currency.

Of course, if you are dealing with somebody regularly, then you should know their preferred currency.

### Domestic Transactions

Use local currency. E.g. Australian company billing someone in Australia:

::: greybox
Our price is $1,000
:::
::: bad
Figure: Bad example - The client doesn't know whether it's AUD or USD
:::

::: greybox
Our price is AUD $1,000
:::
::: good
Figure: Good example - AUD makes it more clear
:::

### International Transactions

#### Known Local Currency

Use their local currency. E.g. Chinese company billing someone in Australia:

::: greybox
Our price is CNY 짜1,000
:::
::: bad
Figure: Bad example - The client will need to convert it
:::

::: greybox
Our price is CNY 짜1,000 (about AUD $160)
:::
::: good
Figure: Good example - AUD gives a clear understanding of the costs
:::

#### Unfamiliar Local Currency

Use USD. E.g. Chinese company billing someone in Brazil.

::: greybox
Our price is CNY 짜1,000
:::
::: bad
Figure: Bad example - The client will need to convert it
:::

::: greybox
Our price is CNY 짜1,000 (about USD $160)
:::
::: good
Figure: Good example - USD gives a clear understanding of the costs
