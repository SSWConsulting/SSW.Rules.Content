Prior to your meeting with the customer you should prepare. Get your [Sprint Planning](/do-you-know-what-happens-at-a-sprint-planning-meeting) (was Release Plan') email ready, so after the meeting you can adjust and promptly send it. 

<!--endintro-->

Learn how to create your Sprint backlog:
- On [Microsoft Docs - Assign backlog items to a sprint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/backlogs/create-your-backlog?view=azure-devops&tabs=agile-process)
- On [GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/quickstart)

Once the backlog is ready, you should [send the Sprint Forecast email to the client](/send-sprint-forecast-and-sprint-review-retro-emails-to-the-client).
