Solutions must be deployed to the new site collection  **before** the content database is resorted to the SharePoint 2010/2013/2016 server:

1. Open  **SharePoint Central Administration** |  **System Settings** |  **Manage Farm Solutions**
2. Click on  **Deploy Solution**
3. Refer to the table you completed in the rule [Do you confirm your list of installed Solutions](/Pages/Do-you-confirm-your-list-of-installed-SharePoint-2007-Solutions.aspx) and deploy the solutions to the same site collections they were deployed to on the SharePoint 2007/2010/2013 server.
