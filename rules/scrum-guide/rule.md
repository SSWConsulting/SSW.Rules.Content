Everyone who will be involved in Scrum (pigs and chickens alike) should have read and understood the Scrum guide. 

Understanding the concepts of Scrum is easy... implementing it is hard!

<!--endintro-->

![Figure: It's handy to know who the pigs and chickens are. The word "commit" and this silly chicken and pig story, were removed from the Scrum Guide 2011](ScrumChickenPig.jpg)

Everyone should:

1. Read the [Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org).
2. Take the [Scrum Open assessment](https://www.scrum.org/open-assessments/scrum-open) and get at least 85% to be “Certified Scrum 1”
3. Watch the awesome video:
