When recording your screen, whether for a tutorial, a webinar, or a demo, your on-camera appearance is just as important as the content itself. Wearing a company-branded T-shirt not only enhances your professional presence but also reinforces your company’s identity with every video you create.

### Why wear a company T-shirt?

* **Brand recognition** – Every video you record is an opportunity to strengthen brand visibility.
* **Professionalism** – A branded shirt shows that your company values quality and consistency.
* **Trust and credibility** – Audiences perceive a well-branded presenter as more authoritative.
* **Consistency** – Helps maintain a uniform look across all videos, making your brand more recognizable.

### When should you wear it?

You should always wear your company T-shirt when:
* Recording tutorials or educational content
* Creating product demos or walkthroughs
* Hosting webinars or live streams
* Appearing in customer-facing videos for your website or social media

However, if the video is for a formal corporate audience, consider dressing appropriately while still maintaining a polished and professional look.

### Bonus Tip: Make sure your logo is visible

When recording, ensure that:
✅ Your camera angle clearly displays your company logo
✅ The T-shirt is clean and in good condition
✅ The background and lighting don’t overshadow your appearance

By consistently wearing your company T-shirt during screen recordings, you turn every video into a branding opportunity while ensuring a professional and polished presence.
