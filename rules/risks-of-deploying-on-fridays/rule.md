A well-known Golden Rule says: 
> Never deploy on Friday.

Deploying on Fridays is inherently risky. If something goes wrong, it could lead to unresolved issues over the weekend, negatively impacting users and the business.

While it is best to avoid Friday deployments, sometimes it’s unavoidable, such as for a security update. In that case, you must weigh up the pros and cons, acknowledge the risks involved and have a plan ready.

### How to be prepared?

- Ensure Comprehensive Monitoring: Make sure all necessary monitoring tools are in place to quickly identify any issues. For instance, you can use [Application Insights](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/how-to-set-up-application-insights/)

- Follow a Pre-Deployment Checklist: Verify the deployment process, including tests, backups, and a rollback plan in case something goes wrong.
- Pre-Deployment Communication:

  - Inform the team about the deployment and ensure that support staff or relevant team members are available if needed. Depending on company or country regulations, get approval from your manager to work over the weekend.
  - Notify all relevant stakeholders, acknowledging that you and the team are prepared to fix issues over the weekend if they occur.
- Post-Deployment Communication: Inform stakeholders whether the deployment was successful or if there were any failures.
- Document Everything: Record any issues, what was done to resolve them, and how to improve in the future.

### How to Mitigate the Risk of a Friday Deployment?
- [Set Up Staging Environments](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/do-you-have-separate-development-testing-and-production-environments/): Always deploy to a staging environment first to test the deployment before pushing to production.

- [Use Feature Flags](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/a-b-testing/): Implement feature flags to control the rollout of new features. This allows for quick disabling of problematic features without a full rollback.

Now, the Golden Rule can be updated to:
> Never deploy on Friday… but be prepared if you must.
