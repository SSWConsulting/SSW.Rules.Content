Open source software is a great option, but it's not always the best. Make sure to consider these points before deciding to using open source software. 

## ✅ Benefits
- Transparency - when a bug occurs you can look at the source code and easily find the area where the bug occurs
- Usually free - there are some paid open source software options
- Customisable - you can fork adapt it to your own needs
- Quality - open source projects have thousands of developers going through the code which ensures quality
- Security - Any vulnerabilities are public so they are more likely to be noticed and fixed (This also means hackers could fix and exploit vulnerabilities)

## 🙅 Downsides
- Lifespan - Open source projects are more likely to be abandoned
- Support - Paid software will typically have a support team you can get in touch with if you have issues. For open source software you can create GitHub issues, but there is a chance the repository owners wont respond.

## Gotchas
- Different licenses have different requirements. See SSW Rule [Do you check before installing 3rd party libraries?](/installing-3rd-party-libraries#5-is-it-an-appropriate-license) for more info.
