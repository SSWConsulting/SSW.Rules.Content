In a world of constant distractions, getting your audience's attention to watch your video content can be difficult. 
One great method is to start your video with a tiny snippet that will 'tease' the audience, which we call the Golden Moment.

### What should a Golden Moment look like?
The Golden Moment is a clip at the start of your video (e.g. before any titles or introductions) that will interest and excite viewers, while also giving them an idea of the video's main content.
As this clip is the first thing an audience will see, it is important to get it right to make a good impression. 

To be a Golden Moment, your clip must be:
* Short - 25 seconds max.
* Concise - to the point with no no waffling or run-on statements.
* Mistake-free - errors in the start look unprofessional and turn people away.
* Representing the video - it will set the audience's expectation for what the rest of the video will be about.
* High Energy - it will set the tone for the rest of the video, so start with a bang!
