When you are regularly creating new releases of a cool .NET application or simply producing new proposals in Microsoft Word, files will inevitably become outdated. Rather than hit the DELETE key put a 'zz' at the front of the filename. The old versions should not be deleted straight away - it is just an unnecessary risk! The zz'd files can remain there until you need more space, then you should delete them.

![Obsolete old files aggressively](ObseleteOldFilesAggressively.gif)Figure: 'ZZ' your files rather than deleting them! 
Alternatively add a folder named zz and move the outdated files into the new folder.

Note: Other systems are used that are less aggressive than our 'zz' rule.

* In .NET, the keyword 
      [obsolete](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/22kk2b44%28v=vs.90%29.aspx)  is used to mark types and members of types that should no longer be used - these then turn up as a compiler warning.
* In HTML, the keyword 
      [deprecated](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Redirect/Deprecated.htm)  is used.

Both allow for some backward compatibility.

### Video versions and using 'zz' on YouTube

When uploading to some video hosting sites, like Vimeo, you can update a video by replacing the original video while keeping the same URL and view count.

In YouTube an uploaded video can't be replaced, so to create a new version of a video it will be uploaded as a new video with a new URL. 

So that there are no broken or missing links, the video status is set to "unlisted", and we use the 'zz' process:
- Add 'zz' to the beginning of the title.
- Add a link to the latest version at the top of the description
