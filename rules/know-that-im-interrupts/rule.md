When somebody sends you an  **IM message** , they are interrupting you.

When somebody sends you an  **email** , they are not interrupting you - assuming you keep your notifications off as per [Do you minimize your Outlook Distractions?](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=7d2b06ad-cac7-4afc-b7af-0552fe30b6ac) You have made the decision to read your emails, so email is in actual fact far more polite than IM which can be a nuisance.

IM is only to be used if they would like you to do something NOW.

**Tip:** If someone pings you on IM (Teams / Skype) for non-urgent tasks, call the person out gently and let them know: "Since I don’t need to do this today, maybe an email would be better".
