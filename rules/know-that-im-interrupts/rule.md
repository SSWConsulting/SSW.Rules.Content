When somebody sends you an **IM message**, they are interrupting you.

When somebody sends you an **email**, they are not interrupting you - assuming you keep your notifications off as per [Do you minimize your Outlook Distractions?](/minimize-outlook-distractions) You have made the decision to read your emails, so email is in actual fact far more polite than IM which can be a nuisance.

IM is only to be used if they would like you to do something NOW.

::: info
**Tip:** If someone pings you on IM (Teams / Skype) for non-urgent tasks, call the person out gently and let them know: "Since I don’t need to do this today, maybe an email would be better".
