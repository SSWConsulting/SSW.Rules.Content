Using emojis to denote content generated by ChatGPT promotes transparency, improves collaboration, and differentiates between human and AI text.

Using these emojis for internal communication in a company has benefits:
           
<!--endintro-->

* **Adoption:** Spread and encourage usage of ChatGPT by showing how and when you use it, enabling others to think about when they can use it too
* **Transparency:** Others can identify AI-generated content, promoting openness and trust
* **Responsibility:** Encourages responsible use of AI-generated content
 
You should use them at the end of your message/email/etc. There are 2 options: 

1. Use 🤖 when you used ChatGPT but you edited the result  

   **Example:** *“Improve SEO with these tips: Create quality content, optimize for mobile, and use relevant keywords. 🤖”*

2. Use 🤖⭐ when the content is entirely generated by ChatGPT

   **Example:** *“AI's impact on industries includes automation, efficiency improvements, and data-driven decision-making. 🤖⭐”* 
 
**Note:** Consider using this mostly internally, as clients and suppliers may not understand the meaning.
