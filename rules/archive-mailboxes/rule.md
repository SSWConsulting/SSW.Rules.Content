In Microsoft 365, user mailboxes are limited to 50GB or 100GB, [depending on the licence you have](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-limits#storage-limits).


There are 3 ways to "archive" emails in Outlook/Exchange, however there's only one true archive option that should be used - **Archive Mailboxes** (also called In-Place Archiving).
