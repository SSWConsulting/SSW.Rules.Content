Projects will change and deviate from the original scope – that is a given in software development. Having the ability to understand the impact of slotting in a new request into the sprint is gold because you can tell management that &quot;If we do X now that means we can’t do Y and Z in this sprint and it will push back the release by another sprint&quot; with the data to back that up. Project Server 2010 gives you that ability with the &quot;Tracking Gantt&quot;
