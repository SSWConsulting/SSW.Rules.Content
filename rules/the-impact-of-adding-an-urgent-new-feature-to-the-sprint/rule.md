<p>Projects will change and deviate from the original scope – that is a given in software development. </p><p>If you are using Scrum, new features should be pushed back to the backlog, to be prioritised into the next sprint, but sometimes the Product Owner will say that it's urgent and has to be done immediately.</p><p>Having the ability to understand the impact of slotting in a new request into the sprint is gold because you can tell management that &quot;If we do X now that means we can’t do Y and Z in this sprint and it will push back the release by another sprint&quot; with the data to back that up. </p>
