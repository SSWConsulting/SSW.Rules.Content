The emails exchanged within your company are more than just communication tools; they are a rich source of data. By analyzing this data, you can gain insights into a company's operations.

<!--endintro-->

Emails should follow a set of [email rules](/rules-to-better-email) that make communication consistent and structured. When emails have standard format and content, data analysis is possible because the content can be parsed.  

**Microsoft Graph API** can be used to extract Outlook data. The extracted data is not just collected; it is transformed and displayed in Power BI reports. These reports provide a visual representation of the data, making it easier to interpret and use for strategic decision-making.
