Public/Protected properties have a number of advantages over public/protected fields:

* **Data validation** 
Data validation can be performed in the get/set accessors of a public property. This is especially important when working with the Visual Studio .NET Designer.
* **Increased flexibility** 
Properties conceal the data storage mechanism from the user, resulting in less broken code when the class is upgraded. Properties are a recommended object-oriented practice for this reason.
* **Compatibility with data binding** 
You can only bind to a public property, not a field.
* **Minimal performance overhead** 
The performance overhead for public properties is trivial. In some situations, public fields can actually have inferior performance to public properties.
