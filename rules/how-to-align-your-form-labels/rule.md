There are different ways to align your form labels and each has its own pros and cons.

<!--endintro-->

### Top aligned

![](label-top-aligned.png)

::: good
Pros:

:::

- Easiest to process
- Fastest completion times
- Good for multiple languages

::: bad
Cons:

:::

- Takes up a lot of vertical space!
- Makes a long-form look even longer!

### Left aligned

![](label-left-aligned.png)

::: good
Pros

:::

- Easy to scan labels, especially if you have a lot of optional labels
- Takes a little more attention to fill in, so useful for complicated forms that require accuracy

::: bad
Cons

:::

- Horizontal space, unlike vertical space, is not limitless, and an unintended horizontal scrollbar is the first sin of web development.
- Slowest completion times
- Poor multilanguage support
- Not even very good responsive support

### Right aligned

![](label-right-aligned.png)

::: good
Pros

:::

- Best at linking label and form
- Good completion rates on small, common forms (i.e. Login, Sign up)

::: bad
Cons

:::

- Hardest to read and scan
- Poor multilanguage support
- Poor responsive support

### Material labeling

Alternatively, we can use Material labeling which places them inside the form and slides up on focus.

![](label-material-labeling.png)

::: good
Pros

:::

- Best for readability
- Best for visual connectivity
- Best for completion rates
- Decent multilanguage support
- Decent responsive support

::: bad
Cons

:::

- Extremely time-consuming to implement. Need to consider the cost/benefit.
- Not necessarily available on 3rd party platforms, like Wufoo or Microsoft Forms.
