There are different ways to align your form labels and each has its own pros and cons.

<!--endintro-->

### Top aligned

![](label-top-aligned.png)  


::: good
Pros:

:::



* Easiest to process
* Fastest completion times
* Good for multiple languages



::: bad
Cons:

:::

* Takes up a lot of vertical space!
* Makes a long-form look even longer!


### Left aligned


![](label-left-aligned.png)  


::: good
Pros

:::

* Easy to scan labels, especially if you have a lot of optional labels
* Takes a little more attention to fill in, so useful for complicated forms that require accuracy



::: bad
Cons

:::

* Horizontal space, unlike vertical space, is not limitless, and an unintended horizontal scrollbar is the first sin of web development.
* Slowest completion times
* Poor multilanguage support
* Not even very good responsive support


### Right aligned

![](label-right-aligned.png)  


::: good
Pros

:::

* Best at linking label and form
* Good completion rates on small, common forms (i.e. Login, Sign up)



::: bad
Cons

:::

* Hardest to read and scan
* Poor multilanguage support
* Poor responsive support


### Material labeling

Alternatively, we can use Material labeling which places them inside the form and slides up on focus.
