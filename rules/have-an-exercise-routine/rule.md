If you are unable to get to the gym there is still plenty of exercises that can be done with no equipment at all. Bodyweight exercises, or calisthenics, offer a convenient and effective way to enhance strength, flexibility and overall fitness without reliance on memberships or equipment.

The [Australian Department of Health recommends for people aged 18-64](https&#58;//www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/health-pubhlth-strateg-phys-act-guidelines#npa1864):

* 2.5-5 hours of moderate per week
or
* 1.5-2.5 hours of vigorous exercise per week
