<span class='intro'> <p>â€‹
                    Studies have shown that you can get up to a 30% increase in productivity by using
                    more than one monitor when you work.
                <br></p> </span>

<p>
                    Providing users with the ability to access more information and images simultaneously,
                    multiple monitor configurations allow for more efficient multitasking between applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, if you were a developer; you could have your references in one monitor
                    and your Visual Studio in another, and directly compare the two without compromising
                    on space or layout.
