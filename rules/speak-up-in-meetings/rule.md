Have you ever been in a meeting and after 30 minutes, you realize you haven’t said a word? As time passes, the pressure builds, and you become more stressed about speaking up. The longer you wait, the harder it feels to contribute. If this sounds familiar, you’re not alone. Many professionals, especially emerging leaders, struggle with speaking up in meetings, and this hesitation can make their expertise go unnoticed.

Here are seven actionable ways to confidently speak up more in meetings:

<!--endintro-->

## 1. **{{ Before }}** the meeting

### Prepare beforehand

Before the meeting, take a few minutes to mentally prepare. Remind yourself that your input is valuable. Go over the agenda, anticipate discussion points, and think of areas where you can contribute. A confident mindset will make speaking up easier.

### Get Support from a Colleague

If you’re hesitant, having an ally in the meeting can help. Coordinate with a trusted colleague beforehand to support each other. They can prompt you to share your thoughts or reinforce your points.


## 2. **{{ During }}** the meeting

### Speak early

Start with small contributions. Instead of waiting for the perfect moment, comment on something simple, like agreeing with a point or adding a brief observation. This gets you comfortable participating early, reducing the anxiety of speaking later.

### Use your colleagues

Engage with your colleagues' ideas by building on them. If someone makes a great point, acknowledge it and add your perspective. This makes speaking up feel more natural and collaborative rather than confrontational.

### Ask questions

You don't always need to have an answer—asking a good question is just as valuable. Thoughtful questions can drive discussion and show that you're engaged. This is an easy way to contribute without feeling the pressure to provide solutions.

### Summarise

If you're unsure about adding new insights, summarising key points from the discussion can be a great way to contribute. Paraphrasing what has been said helps clarify ideas and keeps the conversation structured.


## 3. **{{ After }}** the meeting

### Practice Speaking Up Regularly

Like any skill, speaking up in meetings gets easier with practice. Start by contributing in smaller meetings or informal discussions. Over time, your confidence will grow, making it second nature to speak up in larger settings.


By implementing these simple techniques, you’ll be able to participate more confidently in meetings and ensure your ideas are heard and valued.
