Spec Reviews can be a long process and not being able to talk with the relevant parties that hold the vision and the budget only make it worse. This rule aims to outline key points to make sure that everyone involved with the Spec Review are there.
        

<!--endintro-->

Be a bit blunt and confirm that all the relevant participants can be available for the Spec Review to get the most out of the time. There is no point in holding a spec review if the information is completely useless as soon as the stakeholders look at it. Make sure they are aware of what is needed ahead of time. If all relevant stakeholders aren’t available, be sure to warn of the issues down the line that are expected. Remember if no one in the spec review holds both the budget and vision, the product that you write up will look a lot different to what the other party will expect.
