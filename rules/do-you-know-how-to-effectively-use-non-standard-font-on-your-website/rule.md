In some cases you may need to display text content on your page with a specific                     font. Unfortunately web browsers don't provide an easy way to deliver rich typography                     without sacrificing some functionality. Common approaches include:

1. Display the text as an image
2. sIFR
3. Font stacking
4. Google Fonts
5. Self-hosting
6. Webfont services


<!--endintro-->

Each method mentioned above has their disadvantages. We discourage #1 - Images are bad for Google juice and cannot be selected; and #2 - sFIR uses old technology based on nearly dead Flash.

For more information on the differences between the other methods read: [The best way to serve fonts to your website](http&#58;//www.webdesignerdepot.com/2014/03/the-best-way-to-serve-fonts-to-your-website/).
