When discussing pay, ambiguity is a foe. Terms like 'salary' or 'pay' are too vague and can lead to misconceptions about what is included in an employee’s final payment. 

<!--endintro-->

SSW recommends the term **'salary package including super'** over alternatives like remuneration, salary, pay, payment package or salary package. This is because even though it is longer, it provides more clarity, preventing misunderstandings.  

By specifying 'salary package including super', it becomes clear that the figure **includes** superannuation contributions. This is essential to avoid the unpleasant surprise of salary misunderstanding, where employees may not realize that super is part of their total pay and find out their payslip is less than expected.

Whenever you are worried there might be confusion about a phrase, it’s always a good idea to clarify with the other person and putting in writing what you agreed ['as per your conversation'.](/as-per-our-conversation-emails)
