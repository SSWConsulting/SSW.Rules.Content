<span class='intro'> <p>How you present the product information depends on the sort of application you are
                developing.</p> </span>

<ul><li><p> 
         <em>If the application is wizard application&#58;<br> 
            <br> </em>The first page of the utility should introduce the user to the application.</p><p> Because the first two paragraphs of this screen and the first few paragraphs of the application's website often contain virtually identical information (i.e., describing the product) it may be a good idea to make both the same. The first two paragraphs of the screen can be copied from portions of the website.</p><p> A &quot;More&quot; hyperlink can also be added at the bottom of the screen, which will direct the user to the website where they can read further information about the application.</p><dl class="goodImage"><dt>

      <em>If the application is not a wizard application<br> </em> 
      <br> The main menu of the application should have a Help - About... menu item. When clicked, a new form should open up containing similar information as the page in the wizard application described above.<br>
