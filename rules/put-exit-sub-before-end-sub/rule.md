Do not put "Exit Sub" statements before the "End Sub". The function will end on "End Sub". "Exit Sub" is serving no real purpose here.

```vbnet
Private Sub SomeSubroutine()
'Your code here....
Exit Sub ' Bad code - Writing Exit Sub before End Sub.
End Sub
```

Bad example

We have a program called [SSW Code Auditor](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/Rules.aspx#ExitSub) to check for this rule.
