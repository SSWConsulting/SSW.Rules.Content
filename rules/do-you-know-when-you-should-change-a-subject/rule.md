Some email threads go on forever... sometimes the topic subtly changes... so when should you change the subject? 
The answer is "cautiously" and early on before there are many replies. The reason is email threading.

<!--endintro-->

**When do you change the subject?**

* A: When the original email theme has been superseded by new content.   
  At that point change the email subject to a more relevant description of the content of the thread.
  E.g. From   
  **"Field of Study"** 
  To   
  **"Next Years Conference WAS: Field of Study"**
  
* B: If the original subject was too generic, like "Reminder" or "Invoice".
  This is especially common on automatically generated emails, change the subject by adding the client or project name to the email subject.
  E.g. From   
  **"Invoice"** 
  To   
  **"Northwind website - Invoice for March  WAS: Invoice"**


**Then be clear to show it was intentional**

When you change the subject of an email or an appointment add to the first line:
    (changed subject)


Remember, never forget the [importance of a good email subject](/do-you-realize-the-importance-of-a-good-email-subject) in improving communications.
