Some email threads go on forever... sometimes the topic subtly changes... so when should you change the subject? The answer is "cautiously". The reason is email threading.

<!--endintro-->

**So when do you change it?**

* When the original email theme has been superceded by new content    
  You should change the email subject to a more relevant description of the content of the thread.
 
  E.g. From  
  **"Field of Study"** 
 
  To   
  **"Next Years Conference WAS: Field of Study"**
  
* If the original subject was too generic, like "Reminder" or "Invoice" (especially when automatically generated)   
  Change the subject by adding the client or project name to the email subject.
 
  E.g. From   
  **"Invoice"** 
 
  To   
  **"Northwind invoice for website - March WAS: 'Invoice'"**


Remember, never forget the [importance of a good email subject](/do-you-realize-the-importance-of-a-good-email-subject) in improving communications.
