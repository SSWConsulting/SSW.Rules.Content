Creating a comprehensive summary and recording of your Sprint Meeting is a great way to communicate changes in a product to the community and stakeholders â€” especially for those unable to attend.

<!--endintro-->

## Why record a summary of the Sprint Meeting?

* **Clarity:** Provides a clear, accessible update for all stakeholders, including those not present
* **Documentation:** Serves as a historical record of decisions and discussions, valuable for future Sprints and project continuity
* **Engagement:** Ensures that all stakeholders, regardless of their availability to attend, have access to the same information, promoting inclusiveness and alignment
* **Community:** Allows the community at large to see what is happening on a product and provide feedback

## Prepare for the Sprint Meeting recording

Before you start recording, ensure you have the right people ready for key roles:

* **Have someone ready to scribe:** Designate someone to take detailed notes during the meeting. This person will capture **key decisions**, **[action items](/creating-action-items)**, and **important discussion points** that may not be fully covered in the video summary
* **Have someone ready to [YakShave](https://yakshaver.ai):** Designate someone to handle secondary recordings during the meeting. While the main presenter is recording the Sprint summary, this person can start separate recordings (YakShaves) to create tasks or work items as needed

Having these roles clearly defined beforehand ensures a smoother recording process and better documentation of your Sprint Meeting.

## Record the Sprint Meeting summary

The Sprint Meeting summary should be what it is: a summary. So keep it concise by focusing on the main goals and decisions that were discussed during the Sprint Meeting.

Here's a suggested runsheet for what to cover in the video:

1. Before the recording, inform participants that the session is being recorded and ask them if there's nothing sensitive in the Sprint Retrospective
2. Start the recording by showing the Product website
3. Run through Sprint Review Email - which should include the Sprint Retrospective
4. Run through Sprint Planning Email
5. Finish the recording on the Product YouTube Channel, and mention that the current recording will be uploaded there

See [useful tips on how to make great videos](/making-a-great-done-video).

**Note:** Everyone should be free to speak candidly in a Sprint Retrospective, and you donâ€™t want the fact that there will be a recorded summary to make people not speak up. The recorded retro should only include the main good and bad points... it gives *some* window into the team, but not everything.

::: info
**Tip:** To make the video more entertaining, get more than one person to talk (e.g. ask someone to talk about a PBI that they worked on). Also, when you have a chance, try to include a [YakShave](https://yakshaver.ai) during the recording.

## Share the Sprint Meeting summary recording

If you've never uploaded a video to YouTube, you can follow [this tutorial](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/57407?sjid=14705773004983041204-AP)

**Note:** Don't forget to check that you're uploading to the right channel. Ideally have a channel for each product (e.g. [SSW Website](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi7s9fJp6RlvHCMK2hATK7g), [SSW TimePro](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKf-M2C0b3_ca4kwzmvmERg), etc.).

You will fill the title, description, and thumbnail fields with clear, helpful content to improve visibility and engagement.

::: info
**Tip:** Sometimes you may want to trim some parts of the video (i.e. Long silence at start or end). [Videos can be trimmed straight on YouTube Editor](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9057455?hl=en).

### Video title

It is important to have an accurate title that makes it clear what Scrum Sprint you are making a video for. The best way is to follow a consistent format across each video.
At SSW, we follow this format:

::: greybox
{{ TEAM NAME }} - Sprint {{ OLD NUMBER }} Review + Retro and Sprint {{ NEW NUMBER }} Planning - {{ DATE }}  
:::

### Video description

You should also include a description about the contents for ease of navigation. E.g. YouTube allows you to add timecode chapter markers by adding it in the description.

::: greybox
Join us for {{ TEAM NAME }}'s Sprint {{ OLD NUMBER }} Review + Retro and Sprint {{ NEW NUMBER }} Planning

{{ MIN }}:{{ SEC }} Intro  
{{ MIN }}:{{ SEC }} Sprint Review  
{{ MIN }}:{{ SEC }} Sprint Retro  
{{ MIN }}:{{ SEC }} Sprint Planning  
{{ MIN }}:{{ SEC }} Outro

### Video thumbnail

The thumbnail should show the Sprint iteration, the Team's name and the date when the meeting occured. This often comes from the start screen of a Teams recording.

For a more visual appealing thumbnail, you can use a PowerPoint slide that are updated every Sprint. E.g.: [SSW.Website Thumbnail](https://sswcom.sharepoint.com/:p:/s/SSWWebsitev3/EXK91BgLmO9DnT9np2HabPoBm5vQiKfggtG3DqtDw-aQHA?e=Im08L9).

Below is a good example of how a Sprint Summary video should look like on YouTube.

::: greybox
Don't let the time you spent creating the perfect video go to waste â€” make sure people actually watch it! For those required to view the video, send them the following task:

  1. Watch the video: {{ YOUTUBE URL }}
  2. Leave a like
  3. Rate it out of 10
  4. Leave a brief comment on YouTube

### âœ… Good example of a Sprint Meeting recording

Here is an example of a Sprint Meeting recording from the [Tina CMS](https://tina.io/) Team.

By adopting these practices, teams can ensure that the outcomes of Sprint Meetings are effectively communicated and documented, supporting project success and stakeholder satisfaction.
