Creating a comprehensive summary and recording of your Sprint Meeting is a great way to communicate changes in a Product to the community and stakeholders - especially for people who are unable to attend these meetings. This rule covers the following:

- Why you should record a summary of the Sprint Meeting
- How to record it (best practices)
- How to share the recording

<!--endintro-->

## Why record a summary of the Sprint Meeting?

- **Clarity:** Provides a clear, accessible update for all stakeholders, including those not present.
- **Documentation:** Serves as a historical record of decisions and discussions, valuable for future Sprints and project continuity.
- **Engagement:** Ensures that all stakeholders, regardless of their availability to attend, have access to the same information, promoting inclusiveness and alignment.
- **Community:** Allows the community at large to see what is happening on a product and provide feedback.

## Record the Meeting summary

### Preparing the Summary

- **Highlight Key Points:** Focus on decisions made, goals achieved, and major discussions.
- **Use Clear, Concise Language:** Ensure that the summary is easily understandable, avoiding technical jargon where possible.
- **Include Actionable Items:** Clearly note any action items or decisions that require follow-up.
- **Keep it Generic:** Viewers might not have the same context of the Product, so try to present PBIs as though the viewers do not have prior knowledge.

### Runsheet

Here's a suggested runsheet for what to cover in the video:

1. Before the recording, ask the participants if there's nothing sensitive in the Sprint Retrospective
2. Start the recording by showing the Product website
3. Run through Sprint Review Email - which should include the Sprint Retrospective
4. Run through Sprint Planning Email
5. Finish the recording on the Product YouTube Channel, and mention that the current recording will be uploaded there

### Making the Recording

- **Ensure Good Audio Quality:** Use a decent microphone and test audio levels before starting.
- **Capture Visuals:** Record the screen or presentation to provide context to the discussions.
- **Keep it Engaging:** Even though itâ€™s a recording, try to keep the delivery lively and engaging to maintain viewer interest.

### Utilizing Modern Tools for Recording and Editing

#### Using Microsoft Teams Record Feature

- **Start Recording:** Utilize the built-in recording feature in Microsoft Teams to capture both audio and video of the Sprint Review.
- **Notify Participants:** Always inform participants that the session is being recorded, ensuring compliance with privacy policies.

#### Editing with ClipChamp

- **Import the Recording:** Once the meeting is over, download the recording and import it into ClipChamp.
- **Edit for Clarity:** Trim unnecessary parts, highlight key moments, and add titles or transitions to enhance viewer understanding.
- **Use a consistent professional thumbnail:** Get the design team to make you a nice thumbnail to use for your Sprint Reviews so that it looks professional.
- **Export and Share:** Once edited, export the final video and consider uploading it to a platform like YouTube for easy access and sharing within your organization.
