Creating a comprehensive summary and recording of Sprint Reviews is a great way to communicate changes in a Product to the community and stakeholders. Especially for people who are unable to attend these meetings.

<!--endintro-->

## Why Create a Summary and Recording?

1. **Enhanced Clarity and Transparency:** Provides a clear, accessible update for all stakeholders, including those not present.
2. **Documentation for Future Reference:** Serves as a historical record of decisions and discussions, valuable for future sprints and project continuity.
3. **Inclusive Stakeholder Engagement:** Ensures that all stakeholders, regardless of their availability to attend, have access to the same information, promoting inclusiveness and alignment.
4. **Community Engagement:** Allows the community at large to see what is happening on a product and provide feedback.

## Best Practices for Effective Summaries and Recordings

### Preparing the Summary

- **Highlight Key Points:** Focus on decisions made, goals achieved, and major discussions.
- **Use Clear, Concise Language:** Ensure that the summary is easily understandable, avoiding technical jargon where possible.
- **Include Actionable Items:** Clearly note any action items or decisions that require follow-up.
- **Keep it Generic:** Viewers might not have the same context of the Product, so try to present PBIs as though the viewers do not have prior knowledge.

### Runsheet

Here's a suggested runsheet for what to cover in the video:

1. Show the Product website
2. Run through Sprint Review Email
3. Run through Sprint Planning Email
4. Finish on the Product YouTube Channel

### Making the Recording

- **Ensure Good Audio Quality:** Use a decent microphone and test audio levels before starting.
- **Capture Visuals:** Record the screen or presentation to provide context to the discussions.
- **Keep it Engaging:** Even though itâ€™s a recording, try to keep the delivery lively and engaging to maintain viewer interest.

### Utilizing Modern Tools for Recording and Editing

#### Using Microsoft Teams Record Feature

- **Start Recording:** Utilize the built-in recording feature in Microsoft Teams to capture both audio and video of the Sprint Review.
- **Notify Participants:** Always inform participants that the session is being recorded, ensuring compliance with privacy policies.

#### Editing with ClipChamp

- **Import the Recording:** Once the meeting is over, download the recording and import it into ClipChamp.
- **Edit for Clarity:** Trim unnecessary parts, highlight key moments, and add titles or transitions to enhance viewer understanding.
- **Use a consistent professional thumbnail:** Get the design team to make you a nice thumbnail to use for your Sprint Reviews so that it looks professional.
- **Export and Share:** Once edited, export the final video and consider uploading it to a platform like YouTube for easy access and sharing within your organization.
