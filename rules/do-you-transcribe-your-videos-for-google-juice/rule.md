<span class='intro'> One of the few disadvantages of videos over written content is that&#160;Google can't tell much about your video apart from the title and tags you may&#160;provide when you upload it. By having your video transcribed&#160;and adding the transcription text&#160;to wherever the video is shown, you're giving Google specific information about the&#160;content&#160;of your video.&#160;  </span>
