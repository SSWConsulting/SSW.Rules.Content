Before a Brainstorming event starts, the Brainstorming Presenter should give a presentation to the entire brainstorming group. They should share some highlights and lowlights from the employees, explain how the day will run, share the agenda.

To prepare, draft an email to the boss with the following:

* Curate retro - Check the company retro for important or repeated points (if something is mentioned a few times, it's probably important)
* Give any company updates
* Play the brainstorming video on the rule [Do you use the brains of your company?](/use-the-brains-of-your-company)
* Show the [agenda](/brainstorming-agenda/) (see the appointment)
  * Set the expectations - the event may go overtime
* Show the team allocation GitHub Discussion from [Do you know how to allocate Brainstorming teams?](/brainstorming-team-allocation)

Send it to the person who will do the presentation.
