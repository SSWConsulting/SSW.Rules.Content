### “Co-pilot” rule

Have you ever thought about this: "Why do jet planes always have at least two pilots?" Every major and essential system will have one or more backup systems in case the primary system fails.

Systems generate bugs, and humans can make mistakes. An error-free system does not exist. A small error may not bring the business down, but it is important for accountants to have crosschecks to minimize human error during their daily work.

When two people independently verify each other's work, it reduces the chance of errors. Cross-checking also promotes accountability and a sense of shared responsibility for the quality of the work being performed.



### Avoid conflict of interests

A football player should not take on the role of the referee. The issue here is not with trust, but rather with ensuring that you have good systems that minimize risks. 

When an accountant applies for a leave request, a reimbursement, a salary sacrifice or has a pay rise (congratulations), the best option is always to have another accountant make those changes. The best practice always involves at least 2 individuals – 1 person requesting the change and a 2nd person processing the change.
