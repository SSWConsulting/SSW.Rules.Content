Usually, when mentioning an email in a Microsoft Teams chat, the approach is straightforward, such as typing "email subject: Good morning."

<!--endintro-->

An easy way to elevate this and make your messages more visually appealing is by utilizing text formatting: instead of the traditional format, you can employ the "> {{ SUBJECT }}" command, which conveniently transforms your text to look like an email subject.
This formatting not only enhances the aesthetic appeal of your messages but also facilitates quick comprehension in the team conversation.
