**Question:** What is wrong with this Picture?

![Figure: What is wrong?](../../assets/InconsistentButtonStyles.jpg)  

<!--endintro-->

**Answer:** There are three different types of buttons in the Application:

* *Next &gt;* - Default Window Style
* *Preview* - .NET Flat Style
* *Cancel* - Window XP Style


![Figure: Even labels need to use FlatStyle.System. Can you spot the wrong label?](../../assets/BadDivider.gif)
