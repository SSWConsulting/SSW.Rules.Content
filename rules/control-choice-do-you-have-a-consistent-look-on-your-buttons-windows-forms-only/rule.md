Question: What is wrong with this Picture?

![Figure: What is wrong?](../../assets/InconsistentButtonStyles.jpg)  

<!--endintro-->

 **Answer:** There are three different types of buttons in the Application:

* *Next &gt;* - Default Window Style
* *Preview* - .NET Flat Style
* *Cancel* - Window XP Style


![Figure: Even labels need to use FlatStyle.System. Can you spot the wrong label?](../../assets/BadDivider.gif)  

See our [Rules to Better Windows Forms](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterWindowsForms.aspx#XPThemes) to implement XP Themes in .NET.


| We have a program called [SSW Code Auditor](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/Rules.aspx#ConsistentButtonStyle) to check for this rule. |
