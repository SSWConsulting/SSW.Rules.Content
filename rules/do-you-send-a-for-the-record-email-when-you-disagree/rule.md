<span class='intro'> <p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​​​​​Over the course of work on a project, there will likely&#160;be many&#160;little disagreements,&#160;and most can be captured in ‘as per our conversation’ emails. Sometimes the differences of opinion&#160;relate to​ architectural issues or things that will be hard to change later. A lot of developers are on the quiet, introverted side, but vocal developers make their stance clear.&#160;Even that can be hard with some clients who have super strong voices and some clients are *not* great listeners. Regardless it is important to document disagreements so the client is crystal clear and a stronger version of ‘as per our conversation’ is to include the words ‘for the record’. Too often developers say they disagree but months later, the client may say&#58;<br>“No I don’t recall you disagreed, I thought I gave counter arguments and then I assumed you had agreed with me.”<br></p> </span>

   <font color="#333333"><strong>Figure&#58;&#160;It's&#160;common for people to say &quot;I don't remember you disagreeing with that decision&quot;, sending a &quot;for the record&quot; email makes it clear.</strong><br><br></font></div><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox"><strong>​One war story</strong><br>&#160;<br>One day we had an incident where one of our clients had found out that a developer had hard-coded the CSS (the default Angular way).&#160;​W​hen the client discovered it, they were wild and wanted 24 days written off as a consequence. To be clear, the reaction and the request were disproportionate. However, clients have memories that are fallible and they can be entitled to be upset when they come to a company (like SSW) that prides themselves on following best-practices.<br>&#160;<br>I spoke to the developer about it, and he knew 100% that he had agreed with the Product Owner to leave it that way because it was super quick and they had bigger fish to fry at the time. The developer recalled explaining to the Product Owner that he wasn't comfortable taking that shortcut. The step that the developer failed to do was to cover his ass with an &quot;As per our conversation&quot; email... or when the disagreement is related to architectural issues (or issues that will require a lot of rework later) I suggest a more clear &quot;For the record&quot; email.<br><strong>Note</strong>&#58; Even better the developer could have included a URL in the email with a link to a PBI to remove this technical debt later.<br>&#160;<br>Adam Cogan<br>SSW Chief Architect<br></p><div><font color="#333333"><br></font></div><div><font color="#333333">When you have a&#160;disagreement with someone&#160;who has&#160;decision making power, and you&#160;are&#160;unable to convince them that your recommendation is correct&#160;(and they were unable to convince you that their decision is correct), you should&#160;send an email to the people involved including your thoughts, because&#58;&#160;<br></font></div><ol><li>Later down the track it will provide a learning experience for someone (depending on who was right &#128521;)<br><strong>Tip</strong>&#58; Use a
