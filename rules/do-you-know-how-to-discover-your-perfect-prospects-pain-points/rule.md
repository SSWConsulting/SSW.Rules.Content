Before you move onto this step, first have your target audience information right next to you. After that, start thinking: what do they want? What are their frustrations? What are their aspirations? And finally, what do they fear? Write down all the ideas you might come up with.

Use the template below to brainstorm with your team or your client: 




<dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><img src="Pain Point Pinpointer.png" alt="Pain Point Pinpointer.png" style="margin:5px;width:808px;"><br></dl>
You have a few some ways of doing this, you can: 


* Brainstorm with your employees
* Research online
* Ask your clients directly in person, or to have an open conversation through social media (remember to reply and engage with them, though!)
