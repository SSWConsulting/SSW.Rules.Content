You don’t want to build solutions from scratch, take the business value you can, from a CMS and a CRM. Don't reinvent the wheel.
 The main choices are:

* [www.orchardproject.net/](http&#58;//www.orchardproject.net/)
* [www.DotNetNuke.com](http&#58;//www.dotnetnuke.com/)
* [Microsoft SharePoint](http&#58;//office.microsoft.com/en-au/sharepoint/)
* [www.CommunityServer.org](http&#58;//www.communityserver.org/)
* Microsoft ASP.NET 2.0 hand coded pages


There are pros and cons to all and it depends on what functionality/customization you need but we lean towards Orchard and SharePoint for most solutions.
