Kent Beck is the man credited with "rediscovering" the Test Driven Development methodology.  It's a great way to ensure your code works as expected and it will allow you to catch errors that occur down the track.

<!--endintro-->

Based on Kent Beck's principles, you should:

1. Write code as it spews out of your brain
2. Do lots of small refactoring rather than big architectural rewrites
3. If you are going to change code, add a test first (AKA red-green-refactor)


**Tip:** Read Michael Feather’s book, [<font color="#3a66cc">&quot;Working Effectively with Legacy Code&quot;</font>](http&#58;//www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052) for some insights into effective unit testing.

**Tip:** Don't focus on the percentage of code coverage, focus on whether tests will touch the lines of code you care about.
