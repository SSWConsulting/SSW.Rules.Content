Keeping all your files and work backed up is important, but can be a very complex task to do manually, especially if multiple people are working on the project simultaneously.

<!--endintro-->
### FreeFileSync:

FreeFileSync is folder comparison and synchronization software that creates and manages backup copies of all your important files.

When working on a complex project, there are often a large amount of files and data spread over multiple folders that need to be synchronised.

The best way to keep your project backed up is to use software to track and synchronise of all of these changes.

Notes on Synchronisation modes: 
* **Update**: Syncs in one direction - new and more recently updated files on the left-side will be added to the right side but not the other way. It won't delete any files. **This is best to use in most cases.**
* **Two Way**: Syncs in two directions - new and more recently updated files on both sides will be added to both sides, and it won't delete any files.
* **Mirror**: Syncs in one direction - new and more recently updated files on the left-side will be added to the right side but not the other way. **WARNING:** It will delete any files from the right-side that are not on the left-side. Do not use this unless you know what you are doing!!
