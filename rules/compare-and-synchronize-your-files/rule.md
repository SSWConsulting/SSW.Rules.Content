At SSW, we make sure to keep all our files and work backed up.

This can be a very complex task to do manually, especially if multiple people are working on the project simultaneously, so we use FreeFileSync.

### FreeFileSync:

FreeFileSync is a folder comparison and synchronization software that creates and manages backup copies of all your important files.

When working on a complex project, there are often a large amount of files and data spread over multiple folders that need to be synchronised.
This can be a very complex task to do manually, especially if multiple people are working on the project simultaneously.
The best way to keep your project backed up is to use software to track and synchronise of all of these changes.
