**Remote offices tip:** Donâ€™t make being overseas a barrier. Of course, it is always best to provide a local number as that gives clients peace of mind and keep their costs down. Not many clients will call an international number and there are lots of options - [skype.com/en/features](https://www.skype.com/en/features). The next best alternative is to at least show your overseas phone number.
