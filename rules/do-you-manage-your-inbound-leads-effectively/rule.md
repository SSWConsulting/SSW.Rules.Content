<p>​With the amount of money companies spend on marketing these days, it's vital that, when you receive a phone call enquiring about your services, you know how to handle it.</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>Be prepared for <a href="http://www.ssw.com.au/SSW/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterInboundCalls.aspx#Preparation">inbound calls</a>. You should have a script that your phone operators keep close at hand to make sure you ask the necessary qua​lifying questio​ns. The aim is to determine if you are a good match with the prospect - that way you don't spend time on dead ends and can give more time to the most likely leads. </p>
<p>Once you have qualified the lead, your aim for the remainder of the call should be to arrange a face-to-face Initial Meeting with the client. </p><p>1. Agree on a time for an initial meeting.​</p><p>2. Send this email​ <a href="/Documents/BriefProposal-PreInitialMeeting.docx">Pre Initial Meeting</a>​.​ </p>
<p>3. Send an appointment to the client and everyone attending the meeting (copy the email above.).</p>
