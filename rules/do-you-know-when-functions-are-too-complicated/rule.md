<span class='intro'> <p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​In general you should always be looking to simplify your code (e.g. heavily nested case statements). As a minimum look for the most complicated method you have and check that it needs simplifying.​​<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">In Visual Studio, there is inbuilt support for Cyclomatic Complexity analysis.​​​<br></p> </span>
