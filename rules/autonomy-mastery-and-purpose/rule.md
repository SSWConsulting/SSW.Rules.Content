* **Aligned Autonomy** — Software developers have a desire to be self-directed and find that micro-management is restrictive and stifles their creativity. However its important that teams stay focused on working towards their team goals.
* **Mastery** — Software developers love sharpening their skills.
* **Purpose** — Software developers want to work on important projects that have meaning and make an impact.
