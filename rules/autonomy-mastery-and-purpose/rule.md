We all want work that feels meaningful. When you focus on **Autonomy**, **Mastery**, and **Purpose**, you create an environment where people love what they do, grow their skills, and feel proud of their contribution. These three pillars not only motivate individuals but also build stronger, happier teams.

<!--endintro-->

* **Aligned Autonomy** — Software developers have a desire to be self-directed and find that micro-management is restrictive and stifles their creativity. However its important that teams stay focused on working towards their team goals
* **Mastery** — Software developers love sharpening their skills
* **Purpose** — Software developers want to work on important projects that have meaning and make an impact
