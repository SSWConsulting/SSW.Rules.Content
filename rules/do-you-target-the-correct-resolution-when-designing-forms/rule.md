You will target your application towards resolutions that your customers can use comfortably. It is no good to just tell the customer to increase their resolution on their 15-inch LCD  because your application and others can become unreadable on smaller screens.

See [this rule](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=0350f1d5-8b08-4c76-9516-263626013ef4) for a guide as to which resolutions you will be targeting.
