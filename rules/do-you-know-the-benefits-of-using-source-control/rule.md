Source control is the backup of your code, as well as your change history to track changes. 
 With the source control (we use TFS), we can share project code and cooperate with other team members. Using it allows us to track changes, compare code, and even roll-back if required. Moreover, it keeps our code safe that is the most important.

![](HistoryWindow.jpg)**Figure: View the changes in source control on each individual file** ![](HistoryCompareMenu.jpg)**Figure: We can select different changesets and compare the changes** ![](Compare.jpg)**Figure: We can select different changesets and compare the changes. Blue = modified, Green = addition, Red = deletion 
   
** ![](AnnotateMenu.jpg)**Figure: Right click file and select Annotate to view the history on a segment basis** ![](Annotate.jpg)**Figure: Use annotate to understand (or find the guy) to understand his thoughts before deleting/changing someone elses code** ![](AnnotationAndComment.jpg)**Figure: Annotation is great, but it gets even better when one click gives you the 'check in comment' and the 'work item'**
