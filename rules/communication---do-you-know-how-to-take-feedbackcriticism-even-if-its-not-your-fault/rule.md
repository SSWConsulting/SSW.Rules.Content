<span class='intro'> <p>​​​​​​​​​In any job, you will most likely at some point face some criticism. Someone may be telling you that you’ve done something wrong or just expressing displeasure because you didn’t do something they wanted.<br></p> </span>

<p>The best way to take this is to reply to the person and tell them the following the&#160;3 A's.<br></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">The three A’s&#58;&#160; Acknowledge, Apologize, Act&#160; <br></h3><p> 
   <b>A - </b>The first part of good customer service&#160;is&#160;<b>acknowledging</b>&#160;that something happened. If you don't acknowledge the pain, then&#160;other person won't know if you agree or not that&#160;something is wrong.</p><p> 
   <b>A- </b> <b>Apologize </b>if you&#160;messed up… or even if you didn’t.&#160;<strong></strong>Just be clear you are sorry for their situation. E.g. &quot;I am sorry for the downtime you have been experiencing today&quot;<br></p><p> 
   <b> A - </b>Lastly, explain how you will take <b>action</b>&#160;now, and in the future.<br>​</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Even if you've been wrongly accused of something, you should still show you&#160;understand the&#160;other person's frustration&#160;and demonstrate&#160;initiative.&#160;Always have a view of the future and the big picture.<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">
   <b>Warning&#58;</b>&#160;When wrongly accused of something, most people get stuck on defending themselves, where customers would prefer to hear you care, will take any ownership of the problem and tell them your plan to fix it. <br>Next is to fix it for the future – you could explain the new steps in the process you’ll add or simply say &quot;I'll be more diligent testing in the future&quot;.&#160;<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">More&#58; <b>The 3 A’s of Business</b> (a great article from American Express)<br><a href="https&#58;//www.americanexpress.com/en-us/business/trends-and-insights/articles/the-three-as-of-business/">https&#58;//www.americanexpress.com/en-us/business/trends-and-insights/articles/the-three-as-of-business/ </a> <br></p><dl class="image"><dt> <img src="dilbert-criticism-1.gif" alt="dilbert-criticism-1.gif" style="width&#58;90%;height&#58;auto;" /> <br>
