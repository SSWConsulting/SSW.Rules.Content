It is important to get another developer to check the migration for issues.

<!--endintro-->

They should follow these steps:

1. Start Visual Studio 2013
2. Open Team Explorer and connect to the new TFS Server
3. Confirm that they can:

- Source Code - Browse the projects and code using the Source Code Explorer
- Source Code Operations - Get Latest on a file, make a change and check in
- Source Code History - View the history of a number of files in different projects
- Work Items - Browse and view recent work items

4. Open Visual Studio 2015 and repeat steps 1 to 3.
5. Test that your builds complete successfully on the upgraded build controller(s) and agent(s).
6. Check that they can create a new Team Project in Visual Studio 2015

### Congratulations! You've completed a successful migration!
