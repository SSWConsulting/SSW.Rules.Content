When you are planning on meeting someone or planning an event, it is very important that the date you are meeting up, or running the event on is clear.

<!--endintro-->

To ensure complete clarity, you should always include the day and date when it occurs. This will ensure there is no confusion, and everyone is on the same page.

![✅ Good Example: The days are clearly visable, as well as the date, so the team know exactly when you're visting](date-good-example.jpg)
