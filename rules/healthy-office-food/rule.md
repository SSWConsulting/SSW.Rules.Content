Everyone knows the benefits of a workforce that eats well and has a healthier lifestyle. They are better engaged, take fewer sick days, and are generally happier.

There are many ways to help keep your team healthy!

1. Buy them fresh fruit and veggies every Monday - you can set up an automation to remind someone to buy it, or set up a subscription with a delivery service. 

2. Don't encourage drinking - there are healthier ways to bond at events

3. Free lunches - aim to keep them healthy

4. Healthy options for birthday celebrations like a cake made from fruit
