<p>Should we be listening to music                    at work? I've had the debate&#160;with numerous people.
                </p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>
                    Regardless of whether it is AC/DC or DotNetRocks, music/podcasts should not be used in the work place, especially using headphones, because&#58;​
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I want my team to work with each other, and I don't mind that they hear other conversations
                        going on. Hopefully if they hear about a problem they can fix quickly, they'll help
                        each other out.&#160;</li>
                    <li>It's been suggested that <a href="http&#58;//www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/09/the-multi-tasking-myth.html" class="external" target="_blank">multi-tasking lowers your ability to efficiently
                        carry out a task</a> (e.g. doing your task at hand along with listening to tunes)
                        - by as much as 20%! </li>
                    <li>It can be anti-social - some people can shelter themselves </li>
                    <li>It regularly leads to &quot;oh, I love this song, you should hear it&quot; which subsequently
                        turns into a bigger distraction from work for multiple people </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Others have said I am wrong with reasons like&#58;
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>&quot;It helps me give you 100% - since the office is noisy I can concentrate and I need
                        to block out a noisy environment&quot;.
​                        <br>
                        Isn't the music just creating an additional noise source? </li>
                    <li>&quot;It helps me relax&quot;.
                        <br>
                        Yes I love hearing a good song, for example, when I hear Robbie Williams' &quot;Better
                        man&quot; it gets me pumped a bit and I guess it has a positive effect on a my state
                        of mind. I am unconvinced it helps me program better. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    There is, however, a use for it being &quot;background&quot; music in some scenarios; like
                    when you are doing time consuming mindless stuff like fixing data, building VPCs/VMWares
                    or waiting for long builds.
                </p>
