<p>
                    I love my iPod, but should we be using them
                    at work? Is there a way to use them effectively at work? I've had the &quot;music debate&quot;
                    with numerous people about using personal music in the workplace.
                </p>

<p>
                    Regardless of whether it is AC/DC or DotNetRocks, music/podcasts should not be used in the work place because&#58;
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I want my team to work with each other, and I don't mind that they hear other conversations
                        going on. Hopefully if they hear about a problem they can fix quickly, they'll help
                        each other out. Let me give you an example... say Andrew (who is busy working on
                        another project) overhears Marlon say &quot;Cool I found this great code generator, but
                        I can't get past this error&quot;. I want Andrew to be able to quickly offer up advice
                        (assuming he knows the answer already) to fix Marlon's problem before an issue develops.
                        In this case he would say &quot;Hey we don't use that code generator, you need to use
                        <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/DeveloperGeneral/netTools.aspx">SSW's standard code generator</a>&quot;
                    </li>
                    <li>It's been suggested that <a href="http&#58;//www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/09/the-multi-tasking-myth.html" class="external" target="_blank">multi-tasking lowers your ability to efficiently
                        carry out a task</a> (e.g. doing your task at hand along with listening to tunes)
                        - by as much as 20%! </li>
                    <li>It can be anti-social - some people can shelter themselves </li>
                    <li>It regularly leads to &quot;oh, I love this song, you should hear it&quot; which subsequently
                        turns into a bigger distraction from work for multiple people </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Others have said I am wrong with reasons like&#58;
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>&quot;It helps me give you 100% - since the office is noisy I can concentrate and I need
                        to block out a noisy environment&quot;.
                        <br>
                        Isn't the music just creating an additional noise source? </li>
                    <li>&quot;It helps me relax&quot;.
                        <br>
                        Yes I love hearing a good song, for example, when I hear Robbie Williams' &quot;Better
                        man&quot; it gets me pumped a bit and I guess it has a positive effect on a my state
                        of mind. I am unconvinced it helps me program better. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    There is, however, a use for it being &quot;background&quot; music in some scenarios; like
                    when you are doing time consuming mindless stuff like fixing data, building VPCs/VMWares
                    or waiting for long builds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've also been into a few offices that use ambient music to subdue their employees.
                    Again, I'm not convinced of this as a method mostly due to the fact that your not
                    likely to be able to attend to everyone's tastes, and you're even more likely to
                    intensify the &quot;oh, I love this song&quot; factor.
