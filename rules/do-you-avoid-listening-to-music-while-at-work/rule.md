Should we be listening to music                    at work? I've had the debate with numerous people.

<!--endintro-->

Regardless of whether it is AC/DC or DotNetRocks, music/podcasts should not be used in the workplace, especially using headphones, because:

* I want my team to work with each other, and I don't mind that they hear other conversations going on. Hopefully, if they hear about a problem they can fix quickly, they'll help each other out.
* It's been suggested that [multitasking lowers your ability to efficiently carry out a task](http&#58;//www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/09/the-multi-tasking-myth.html) (e.g. doing your task at hand along with listening to tunes) - by as much as 20%!
* It can be anti-social - some people can shelter themselves
* It regularly leads to "oh, I love this song, you should hear it" which subsequently turns into a bigger distraction from work for multiple people


Others have said I am wrong with reasons like:

* "It helps me give you 100% - since the office is noisy I can concentrate and I need to block out a noisy environment". 
Isn't the music just creating an additional noise source?
* "It helps me relax". 
Yes I love hearing a good song, for example, when I hear Robbie Williams' "Better man" it gets me pumped a bit and I guess it has a positive effect on my state of mind. I am unconvinced it helps me program better.
* "In an open office, headphones are not merely transmitters of sound, they are like ‘Do Not Disturb’ signs on a hotel room door."
In several open offices using a headphone seems to be encouraged as the most effective for productivity.


There is, however, a use for it being "background" music in some scenarios; like when you are doing time-consuming mindless stuff like fixing data, building VPCs/VMWare or waiting for long builds.

**Note:** Please see our [Rules To Better Dead Time](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterDeadTime.aspx#AudioDevice) for how we like to effectively use audio devices like iPods when we're not at work.
