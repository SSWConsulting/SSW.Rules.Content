## Remove clutter from your new tab experience

When you open a new tab in your browser and it shows you a bunch of news articles, videos and other clutter, it can be distracting and take you away from your current task. You can remove this noise by turning off all the information in the new tab settings.

1. Open your Edge or Chrome browser
2. If you are not in the new tab experience click the + button to open a new tab
3. Click on settings
4. Change Quick links to Off
5. Toggle off Show greeting
6. Set Content to Content off
