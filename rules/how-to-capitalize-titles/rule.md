It's important to use correct capitalization when writing titles/headings for web content. For main titles, you should capitalize the first word, all nouns, all verbs (even short ones, like "is"), all adjectives, and all proper nouns. Leave subtitles in normal sentence form.

Figure: Good example for titles - Only conjunctions and prepositions (both having similar rules) should not be capitalized. E.g. "at", "on", "but", "and", "with", etc

It's best to only do this on main titles, and leave subtitles in normal sentence form - only capitalize the first word and proper nouns. Basically, it saves hassles... English is a confusing language, and there are too many variations that cause too many arguments.
