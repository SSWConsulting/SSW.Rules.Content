The  **&lt;title&gt;** ,  **&lt;h1&gt;** , and  **&lt;h2&gt;** tags need to be descriptive. They should briefly describe the purpose or content of the page. Have a look at the following two images. The first image is a bad example as the title bar and page heading are not very descriptive. The second image is a better example as title bar and page heading are more informative.
