The **&lt;title&gt;**,  **&lt;h1&gt;**, and **&lt;h2&gt;** tags need to be descriptive. They should briefly describe the purpose or content of the page.

<!--endintro-->

Have a look at the following 2 images. The first image is a bad example as the title bar and page heading are not very descriptive. The second image is a better example as title bar and page heading are more informative.

::: bad

:::

::: good  
![Figure: Good example - Descriptive title/headings](good-title-headings.png)  
:::

We have a program called [SSW Code Auditor](http://codeauditor.com/) to check for this rule.
