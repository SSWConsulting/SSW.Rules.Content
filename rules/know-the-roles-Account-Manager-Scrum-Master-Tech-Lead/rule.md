Medium to large software development projects have people on them with varying roles and responsibilities. In order not to double up, or miss something, it’s important to define what each should do. 

Scrum already covers the roles of the **[Developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLqCkj0PvtE)**, the **[Product Owner](/do-you-know-the-how-to-be-a-good-product-owner)**, and the **[Scrum Master](/the-team-do-you-help-your-scrum-master-not-scrummaster-protect-and-serve-the-team)**, but from a consultancy’s side, there’s also the **Tech Lead** and the **Account Manager** to consider.
