Medium to large software development projects have people on them with varying roles and responsibilities. In order not to double up, or miss something, it’s important to define what each should do.

Scrum already covers the roles of the **[Developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLqCkj0PvtE)**, the **[Product Owner](/do-you-know-the-how-to-be-a-good-product-owner)**, and the **[Scrum Master](/the-team-do-you-help-your-scrum-master-not-scrummaster-protect-and-serve-the-team)**, but from a consultancy’s side, there’s also the **Tech Lead** and the **Account Manager** to consider.

### Hi {{Tech Lead}}

According to {{ link to Client record in CRM }}

As you can see, you are the Tech Lead for {{Client Name}}.

1. Did you already know this?
2. Have a read of [SSW.Rules | Do you know the non-Scrum roles of a project?](/know-the-non-scrum-roles) Make sure you know what is involved with this non-Scrum role (it’s not just responsibility of the technical decisions on the project 😉)
3. Of those bullet points listed on the rule… which is your #1?
