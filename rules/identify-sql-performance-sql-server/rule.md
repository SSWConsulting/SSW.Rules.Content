## Identifying CPU Pressure

When looking at SQL Server, you often get performance issues, but how can you figure out what might be the cause?

<!--endintro-->

To figure out whether the SQL Server itself is experiencing CPU pressure, fire up Task manager and take a look at the CPU usage. If the CPU is high and SQL Server is not the primary consumer, evaluate whether you can separate the CPU consuming workload from your SQL Server by moving one onto another server.

A good way to identify if SQL Server is experiencing CPU Pressure internally is to try the following SQL. It counts the number of SQL batches, compilations and recompilations per second averaged over a minute. _Note_ A batch is a group of one or more SQL statements sent to the server at the same time. The batch separator, GO, is used to separate batches.

```sql
DECLARE @BatchRequests bigint;
DECLARE @Compilations bigint;
DECLARE @Recompiles bigint;

select @BatchRequests = [Batch Requests/sec], @Compilations = [SQL Compilations/sec], @Recompiles = [SQL Re-Compilations/sec] from
(select cntr_value, counter_name from sys.dm_os_performance_counters
where counter_name in ('Batch Requests/sec', 'SQL Compilations/sec' , 'SQL Re-Compilations/sec') ) as SourceTable PIVOT
(max(cntr_value) for counter_name in ([Batch Requests/sec], [SQL Compilations/sec], [SQL Re-Compilations/sec])) as pivottable

WAITFOR DELAY '00:01:00';

select ([Batch Requests/sec] - @BatchRequests) / 60 as BatchesPerSec, ([SQL Compilations/sec] - @Compilations) / 60 AS CompilationsPerSec, ([SQL Re-Compilations/sec] - @Recompiles) / 60 as RecompilesPerSec from
(select cntr_value, counter_name from sys.dm_os_performance_counters
where counter_name in ('Batch Requests/sec', 'SQL Compilations/sec' , 'SQL Re-Compilations/sec') ) as SourceTable PIVOT
(max(cntr_value) for counter_name in ([Batch Requests/sec], [SQL Compilations/sec], [SQL Re-Compilations/sec])) as pivottable
```

The BatchesPerSec should be under 1000. Compilations should be less than 10% of the BatchesPerSec and the RecompilesPerSec should be less then 10% of the CompilationsPerSec.

## Identifying Memory Pressure

Open Task manager, select Performance > Memory to check whether all the memory is being used.

Use Perfmon and monitor these counters:

- Process\Working Set - to check individual apps' memory usage.
- Memory\Available MBytes - to check overall memory usage.

If any of these are using all of the memory then SQL Server may be experiencing memory pressure.
If the memory is not being used by SQL Server, then evaluate whether SQL Server and the other workload should be on separate servers.

## Identifying IO Pressure

Open Task Manager, select Performance > Disk (\*) to check for disks being pushed to their limits.

Monitor the following using Perfmon:

- LogicalDisk\Disk Bytes/sec
- LogicalDisk\Avg. Disk sec/Transfer

If any disks are being pushed to their limits, you need to evaluate whether SQL Server is performing the IO. If it is not, then the easiest solution is to move the application doing all the disk access on to a separate server to your SQL Server.
