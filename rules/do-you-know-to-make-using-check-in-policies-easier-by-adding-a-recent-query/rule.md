![Select A Recent Work Item](SelectARecentWorkItem.jpg)Figure: When you use Check-in policies you often will need to select a work item that you selected recently

<!--endintro-->


Make this easy on yourself by adding a query 'Recent'1. Create a work item query that returns you the last changed work item <img alt="Add a query" src="AddQuery.jpg">
<dd>Figure: Add a query just for your associated check ins </dd>
2. Just copy the 'Tasks - My' query
3. Add the sort date of 'Changed Date' sorted by descending <img alt="Sorted the query by 'Changed Date' " src="SortedByChangedDate.jpg">
<dd>Figure: The query should be sorted by 'Changed Date' </dd>
4. Use that query on your check ins and you find the relevant work item easily
