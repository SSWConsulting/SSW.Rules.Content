Some employees receive more emails than others and often do not dedicate enough time to managing their inbox.
It's important that inboxes are managed and cleaned with a goal of getting to 0.

We have some rules about [how to manage your inbox](/rules-to-better-inbox-management)

To mitigate this problem, organizations should have an Inbox Zero team. This team should follow Scrum.

## ✅ Benefits of an Inbox Zero Team

* **Accountability**: Each member will join this teams Daily Scrum, this will ensure people stay focused on getting their inbox back to a manageable state
* **Prioritization**: Sprint Reviews with the Product Owner will help people know what is important from their inbox
* **Collaboration**: Team members can share best practices and tools for replying done and getting their inbox to 0

## How do you determine who joins the team?

People should only join the team if they have 100+ emails.

To determine which people are in the team, create a report that tracks which employees have the most emails and make it someone's responsibility to check this once a week.

Whenever someone changes team, their inbox should be checked to see if it's 100+.

## When do people leave the team?

When they are in sync with the Product Owner and both agree all the important emails are done, they should join a standard Scrum team.
