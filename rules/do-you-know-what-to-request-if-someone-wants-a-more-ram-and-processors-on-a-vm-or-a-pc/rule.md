A “Too
slow” is not enough info.

<!--endintro-->
Request
an image of the “Resource Monitor”
Then
after you decide there is justification:

•           Do a typical action – take a new
image or baseline.

•           give the additional resources e.g. Ram
and processors….

•           Do the typical action again – take
another image of the “Resource Monitor”

•           If there is some improvement, reply
“done” (otherwise reply “not done”)



Note:
An ideal email subject prefix for more resources would be e.g. “Performance issue
– “Machine name”

this, pass their request :-)**
