​Replying inline should be the exception rather than the rule as it messes up the history of the email thread. If you do - copy and paste the entire email in your reply and comment on each issue at a time. It's useful to write your comments in red. And make sure what you type should always be aligned left, not indented. Remember, if you write emails with one issue at a time you won't need to do this too often.
