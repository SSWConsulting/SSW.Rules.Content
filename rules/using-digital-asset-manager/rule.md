## Why get a DAM?

Trying to manage your large library of digital files can be quite difficult to do using just Windows File Explorer or Mac's Finder as you are limited to folder structure and file names, which can lead to lost and abandoned assets due to ridged search functionality. When trying to preview your assets, your operating system may also lack support for previewing proprietary formats (E.G. Fujifilm's .RAF or Nikon's .NEF). A Good digital asset manager like Adobe Bridge solves this.

while there are several digital asset managers on the market, each with its strengths and weaknesses. For the majority of small teams, independent creatives and the budget-conscious, Adobe Bridge is more than enough to handle the task.

## What is Adobe Bridge?

Adobe Bridge is a creative digital asset manager that lets you preview, organize, edit, and publish multiple creative assets (including Adobe Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, After Effects, and Dimension files) with thumbnails and rich previews. Edit metadata. Add keywords, labels, and ratings to assets. Organize assets using collections, and find assets using powerful filters and advanced metadata search features.

If you are a creative looking to efficiently manage your assets, follow these best practices:

## Organize your media files

By creating a well-structured folder hierarchy and sticking to a standard naming convention, we can make sure media assets won't go missing or accidentally deleted.
Consider organizing videos based on projects, clients, or types of footage (e.g., interviews, B-roll, aerial shots).

This is crucial when creating a stock footage library. After you have finished a project, consider rendering your B-Roll footage into usable clips and place them in

## Utilize metadata

Leverage the power of metadata with tags and or keywords and enhance searchability. In Adobe Bridge you can provide additional information about your media asset. Add relevant details such as project name, shoot location, keywords, and descriptions to your file, doing so will make it significantly easier to search for specific videos and streamline your workflow.

## Importing and Exporting Keywords for team collaboration

Although Adobe Bridge is made without multi-user support. With a workaround, It is still possible to use this program in a small team, this is made possible due to the ability for keywords to be written onto each file directly. So as long as your team uses a shared keywords list, searching your media library should be simple.
You can do this by importing and exporting keywords .XML file for your team to use. 

1. First Navigate to the Keywords tab and right-click the tab to open the dropdown menu.

3. Save this file with a version number to a shared folder accessible to everyone in your team.
4. To import an existing keyword list, navigate and click on import from the same list. Then select the .XML file you want to import.
