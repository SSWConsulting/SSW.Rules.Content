1. Prepare a new image. We recommend running  **Windows 2008 R2 Server x64**using Hyper-V Manager. Your options are:
    1. Manually build a server
    2. A syspreped image (this will be quicker)
    3. System Center Virtual Machine Manager (recommended, quickest)
2. Add the roles
    1. Application Server
    2. IIS
3. Install  **SQL Server 2008 x64** default configuration
