A person's signature is extremely valuable. Getting a signature is hard work. Salespeople use all sorts of euphemisms to avoid that confronting request: _"...if you could just sign here..."_

<!--endintro-->

Requesting a **signature** (or just an initial) on non-contractual type documents (especially screenshots, mockups, or data-schemas) is very beneficial.

::: greybox

Requesting a client's initials is encouraged for all projects, but **required** for fixed-price projects as their initials on the original specifications would show that everyone was aligned and approved the specifications.

- If the client pushes back _"Why am I signing it?"_ reply with:  
  _"This is not a legal document but a good practice to do before we start coding. It is cheaper to change the mockups now. Changing the code once it is written is much more expensive."_

- If the client is remote, getting their initials is not easy. Instead, include a screenshot in an email and add "Checked by {{ProductOwnerName}}" as per the ['Checked by'](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/checked-by-xxx) rule.
:::

When you ask a client to review a mockup, they will generally take a cursory glance, perhaps make a comment or two and then move on to something else. 

Asking them to initial/sign the document always makes them take a second or third look, ask someone else, or at least spend a few more minutes working out whether it's correct or not.

Training clients to review the work carefully leads to better quality projects.
