A person's signature is extremely valuable. Getting a signature is hard work. Salespeople use all sorts of euphemisms to avoid that confronting request: _"...if you could just sign here..."_

Requesting a **signature** (or just an initial) on non-contractual type documents (especially screenshots, mockups, or data-schemas) is very beneficial.

Getting paper signed is the “Dinosaur Method”. These days there are 2 main scenarios:
- The "Checked by {{ NAME }}" system for when you are with the person or sharing screens with the person as per the ['Checked by'](/checked-by-xxx) rule 
- The "Test Please" system for when it's a big job or it needs to be done asynchronously as per the ["Test Please" rule](/conduct-a-test-please) rule

Requesting a client's initials is encouraged for all projects, but **required** for fixed-price projects as their initials on the original specifications would show that everyone was aligned and approved the specifications.

- If the client pushes back _"Why am I signing it?"_ reply with:  
  _"This is not a legal document but a good practice to do before we start coding. It is cheaper to change the mockups now. Changing the code once it is written is much more expensive."_

:::

When you ask a client to review a mockup for example, they will generally take a cursory glance, perhaps make a comment or two and then move on to something else. 

Asking them to initial/sign the document/file always makes them take a second or third look, ask someone else, or at least spend a few more minutes working out whether it's correct or not.

**Note:** Please make sure you have a documented “Test Pass” (even after you actioned the feedback you still need to have a “Test Pass”).

::: info
**Warning:** You shouldn't rely on links to a mockup because the design can change... same problem as linking to Terms and Conditions. Therefore the better version is create an email with screenshots/content and add "Checked by {{ PRODUCT OWNER NAME }}"

Training clients to review the work carefully leads to better quality projects.
