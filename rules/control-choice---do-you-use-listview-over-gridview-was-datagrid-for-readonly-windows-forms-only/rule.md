<span class='intro'> <div>Yes a ListView looks nicer than a DataGrid, but a Datagrid is better because it has more functionality (out of the box that is). With a ListView you cannot&#58;</div>
<ul><li>Copy and paste - although you can select a row of data in both controls, you can't copy and paste a whole row from the ListView</li>
<li>Sort data - always useful when there are more than about 20 rows</li>
<li>DataBind - always saves heaps of code</li></ul> </span>

<div>So our old rule was to always use the ugly DataGrid (although we were never happy about that).</div><dl class="badImage"><dt> <img height="526" width="534" src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/UsingDataGridWhenNotNeeded.gif" alt="DataGrid" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Bad Example - The DataGrid is ugly</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt> <img height="526" width="534" src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/SortableListView.gif" alt="Sortable ListView" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good Example - A beautiful ListView - a nicer look over the datagrid</dd></dl><div>So the listview looks nicer?
