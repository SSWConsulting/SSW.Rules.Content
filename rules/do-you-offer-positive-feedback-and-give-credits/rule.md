<span class='intro'> <p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​Receiving positive feedback makes everyone feel good,&#160;peps them up and encourages them to do more of whatever they are doing.<br>Forgetting to recognize success
                    means they have​&#160;no motivation to succeed.
                <br></p> </span>

   <b>Bonus&#58;</b> If you want to go further, you can tweet the link where you've found help from.&#160;</p><p>
