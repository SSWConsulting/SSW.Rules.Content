Sometimes when you are using ChatGPT, you might find yourself typing in similar prompts over and over for common tasks. Creating ChatGPT prompt templates can save time and improve the consistency of AI-generated outputs. These templates are a starting point with the necessary elements (role, result, intent, context, and constraint) each time.

Here are some examples to use:

1. **Responses to clients**  
   "As a {{ ROLE }}, draft a response to a client's question regarding {{ ISSUE }} with our {{ PRODUCT/SERVICE }}.   
   (Goal: Address the concern, Constraint: Maintain a professional and empathetic tone)" 
2. **Debugging code**  
   "As a software developer, identify the possible causes of the error in the following code snippet and suggest fixes. {{ PASTE CODE }}.    
   (Goal: Resolve the bug, Constraint: Provide clear explanations and solutions)" 
3. **Market research**  
   "As a market research analyst, provide an overview of the competitive landscape for {{ INDUSTRY }} in {{ REGION }}.  
   (Goal: Identify key competitors, Constraint: Focus on the top 5 companies)" 
4. **Social media post**  
   "As a social media manager, generate 5 creative caption ideas for our {{ COMPANY }} account that engage our audience and promote {{ PRODUCT/SERVICE }}.  
   (Goal: Increase engagement, Constraint: Suitable for {{ PLATFORM }})"
5. **Content creation brief**  
   "As a content strategist, create content for a {{ BLOG/WEBPAGE/NEWSLETTER/ETC }} focused on the topic of {{ SUBJECT }}. \
   (Goal: Engage target audience, Constraint: Maintain brand voice and style)"
6. **Team meeting agenda**  
   "As a team leader, create an agenda for our upcoming {{ MEETING TYPE }} with a focus on {{ KEY TOPICS }}.  
   (Goal: Facilitate productive discussions, Constraint: Limit the meeting to {{ DURATION }})"

Tips:
