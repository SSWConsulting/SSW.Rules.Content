<span class='intro'> <p>If you negotiate with a supplier in relation to an invoice, do you ensure the invoice is reissued? <br></p><p>It is not always common but sometimes you will negotiate a change in the agreed price once an invoice has been issued by a supplier. This might be because there was a change or defect in the good or service provided and a lesser amount is agreed or an agreement that a certain amount of the invoice will be paid later when the rest of the product or service is delivered.<br></p> </span>

<p><strong>Do not pay an invoice in part.&#160;</strong>You should ask the supplier to reissue the invoice or issue a credit note in relation to an invoice. Otherwise, the supplier may say that there is a balance of the invoice owing.&#160;&#160;<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">“Jim.
