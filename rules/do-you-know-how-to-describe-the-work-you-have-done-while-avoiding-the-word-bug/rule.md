<p>Whether on your TFS check in comments, or your timesheet entries, there are a few rules you should follow on how to best explain the value you have created for the client&#58;</p><ul><li>Use standard terms to describe the work you have done e.g. 'Build', 'Investigated', 'Resolved', 'Enhanced', 'Created', 'Optimized', 'Experimented with', 'Improved' or 'Fix'. Don't use unprofessional language like 'sorted out' or 'worked out'</li><li>The term 'Investigated and changed' is to be preferred over 'Fixed bug'.<br>
                        'Bug' gives the impression that the problem was solely the developer's fault, when often most fixes are to do with changes as a result of unspecified work (extra validation, extra testing or gold plating).<br>
                        <dl class="bad"><dt class="greyBox">'Fixed Bug on customer form'</dt><dd>Figure&#58; Bad example</dd></dl><dl class="good"><dt class="greyBox">'Investigated and improved the  validation on customer form to enable saving when Customer Name is {gtHTMLChar} 100 characters' </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good example</dd></dl>
                        Note&#58; Of course, if the problem was the developers fault, you can still use 'bug' when appropriate. 
                    </li><li>Be specific about what you did.&#160;e.g.&#160;</li><ul><li>If you create a new form, write 'Created frmClient', </li><li>If you are adding a button to a form write 'Added btnAddNew to frmClient' </li><li>If you are trying to find a bug write 'Investigated error on frmClientDiary'. </li><li>If you fix something, write 'Resolved'. </li><li>If you are making something faster, write 'Optimized procClientDiary'. </li><li>If you are writing stored procs, write down their names</li></ul><li>Follow the normal rules of English, use normal sentence structure not note style</li><li>Use capital letters appropriately - if it is a Proper Noun use a capital - e.g. Adam Cogan, SQL Server, Toyota is ok, Website is not</li><li>Don't start a new line for every detail (it takes up too much room on the invoice)</li><li>Use past tense e.g. 'Updated web page' rather than 'update web page'</li><li>Avoid abbreviations. Use 'version' rather than 'ver'</li><li>Don't skip small words like 'and'</li></ul>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> If you have any working papers (e.g. written notes from a client requesting work), once the work is completed write 'DONE' on the paper and give it to your project manager for filing.</p><dl class="greyBox"><dt>'Apply changes as per Tony's request for FRDCAPP'</dt></dl><dl class="bad"><dd>Figure&#58; This is an example of a bad timesheet note</dd></dl><dl class="greyBox"><dt>'CaterPRO! Version 8.3; Fixed Sales Reports (rptSales) (reconciles correctly with Food Sales Summary; Fixed Function Counts (was doublecounting); Fix to DiaryTemplate Updates; Fix to copy of Contacts (frmMoveClientPopup) - primary; Attempt to run CaterPRO! In XP with Alan.' </dt></dl><dl class="good"><dd>Figure&#58; This is an example of a good timesheet note</dd></dl>
