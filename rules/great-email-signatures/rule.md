Email signatures are a great way of adding some advertising and branding. You should always use a nice email signature for **external emails** .
Internally, you shouldn't use any or just use a short one (just your name or initials).

Full email signatures are great when they have:

* A little  **branding** and advertising (can be a tagline or company news), so people know instantly who it is from
* Your  **phone number** (in international format - it's important to add the country code so people from all around the world can easily add you to their contacts - as per [Do you know the right format to show phone numbers?](/do-you-know-the-right-format-to-show-your-phone-number))
* Your company  **website link** (e.g. www.ssw.com.au/)
* Your work-related  **social media** and  **blog** link
* Your **position**
* Your  **location** (city/country) where you are based

Mobile signature are not easily customized so they can be simpler.

### Mobile Signature

Use the "mobile signature" when sending emails from your phone.

### PC Long Signature

**Use the complete "long signature" when sending a new email or appointment to a client.**

This is created in HTML and goes well on emails with Word used as the email editor. Include some product advertising, like what's new on your monthly newsletter. It should have the company colors.

However, you shouldn't use your long signature on **every** sent email. It's recommended to have a simpler version for internal emails and appointments:

### PC Short Signature

Use a really short signature (your first name or initials) or no signature at all in internal emails  as people already know who you are.

### Option 1: CodeTwo (Paid)

The easiest way to implement consistent signatures across a company is to use a 3rd party signature provider e.g. CodeTwo.com and Exclaimer.com\
This way you quickly get great email signatures, with consistent branding, to all your employees and on all their devices. CodeTwo is cheaper and has a nicer design tool UI than Exclaimer, however they are both good. CodeTwo is built on Microsoft technology.

CodeTwo (and Exclaimer) give: 

1. Automatic signatures are added on any device – from laptop to smartphones
2. Consistent signatures for every employee as they all use one template – [consistency is important](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/do-you-understand-the-value-of-consistency)
3. Management via a portal
4. Marketing can run campaigns and schedule changes to all signatures
5. Hassle-free setup – users do not need to touch any signatures on any devices.

**Warning:** Unfortunately you need to setup up your signature in Outlook and OWA. There is no way to share this.

**SSW Only:** You can automatically have your Outlook signature changed on sign-in via a script. See https://github.com/SSWConsulting/LoginScript 

Note: This does not setup your signature on OWA or your mobile signature
