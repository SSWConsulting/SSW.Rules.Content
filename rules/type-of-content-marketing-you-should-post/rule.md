Sometimes it can be hard to keep **generating content daily for your social media** and even more when there’s not much going on. Here are a few types of content you could use for your next social media posts:

<!--endintro-->

### 1 - Internal projects, services or products that your business developed or offers

### 8 - Business blog posts

### 9 - General content written/followed by your team

It can be a blog post or one of the many useful SSW Rules - these are best practices that are worth sharing with everyone.

If your company follows an SSW rule, then share it on your social media too. Use **\#ssw** and **\#sswrules** so readers can find more!

### 10 - Employment opportunities

### 13 - Memes (if they suit your industry)

### 14 - Application upgrades/updates

When you make an improvement to a product, share it on social media. This can be a new feature, big bug fix, or upgrade. This benefits both the business and the employee.
