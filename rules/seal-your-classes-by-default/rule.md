Traditionally you would only seal a class if you wanted to prevent it from being inherited. This is a good practice, but it's also a good practice to seal all classes by default and only unseal them when you need to inherit from them.

On the surface it appears that you are just preventing someone from inheriting from your class, but there are a few other benefits to sealing your classes by default:

- Performance gains
- Only things that are designed to be inherited can be inheritable
- Inheritance can be easily abused and as a result is considered a minor anti-pattern
- Composition is preferred over inheritance
