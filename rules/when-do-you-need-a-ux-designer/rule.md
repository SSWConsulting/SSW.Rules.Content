Have you ever found yourself on a project and wondered if you require a UX designer? Especially one who can create interactive prototypes with tools like Figma?

If you are asking yourself that question, you probably need a UX designer. Here are 7 situations where you could benefit from a UX designer.

1. **Specification Reviews:** A UX designer can help develop low fidelity non-interactive wireframes using Figma that can be verified with the client. This wireframe can be used to estimate project costs and will often become the starting point of a more elaborate interactive prototype.
2. **Application or Web Development:** If you're building a new Product, Service, Website or Application, a UX designer can be invaluable. They can conduct user research, create user personas, design user flows and wireframes, and ensure that the end product provides a positive and intuitive user experience.
3. **Redesign or Improvement Projects:** When you already have an existing product or service but want to enhance its user experience, a UX designer can assess the current design, identify pain points and areas for improvement, and propose design solutions to optimize the user experience.
4. **Usability Issues**: If you're receiving feedback from users indicating usability issues or facing high bounce rates, a UX designer can conduct usability testing, analyze user behaviour, and recommend design modifications to address those issues.
5. **Complex Systems or Workflows**: A UX designer can simplify the user interface, streamline the user journey, and make the overall experience more efficient and user-friendly, especially when considering complex applications or online services.
6. **User Research and Analysis:** To gain a deeper understanding of your target audience, their needs, and preferences, a UX designer can conduct user research, interviews, and surveys to gather insights that inform the design process.
7. **Accessibility and Inclusive Design:** A UX designer can help ensure your product or service is accessible to people with disabilities by incorporating inclusive design principles and following accessibility guidelines.

Remember, the specific need for a UX designer may vary depending on the nature of your project, but their primary goal is to create meaningful and enjoyable experiences for the user.
