<span class='intro'> <p>​​When explaining steps in a process, e.g. Printing a file, make sure to say something &quot;will&quot; happen or is happening. This is especially important when describing your own software, because saying something &quot;should&quot; happen implies that it may or may not happen, i.e. there could be bugs!</p> </span>
