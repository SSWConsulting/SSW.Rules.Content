Sometimes the person you send your email to may not reply immediately because they're busy or just may have forgotten about it. 

<!--endintro-->

If you need an answer, remind them by:

1. Sending an IM with the words "(PING) - {{ EMAIL SUBJECT }}"

If you still get no response, then:

2. Reply to the email thread with a PING:  
   - Put (PING) in 1<sup>st</sup> line of the Body
   - Remember to reply to ALL
   - Feel free to include any other reminders, such as "following-up, and looking forward to your reply" or "Need an answer please"

**Tip:** Do **not** use (RESEND) as it may sound aggressive.

Of course you might use slightly friendlier language following up a client or a third party compared with following up a colleague! If it's really important and you need an answer you might like to [consider using the phone instead of email](/dones-do-you-use-email-for-tasks-only-not-communication).
