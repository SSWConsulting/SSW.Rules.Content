Acronyms are a common way to shorten words or phrases, but they can often lead to confusion and misunderstandings, especially for those new to a particular field or industry. To ensure clear communication, it is best to avoid acronyms whenever possible and use the full name of the term or phrase instead.    

<!--endintro-->

1. Avoid acronyms whenever possible. Use the full name of the term or phrase instead.
2. Especially, avoid using acronyms in titles, headings, and other prominent places. This can make it hard for readers to understand the content.
3. If you must use an acronym, define it the first time you use it in your writing.
4. If you must use acronyms, be consistent. If you use an acronym for a term or phrase, use it consistently throughout your writing.

By avoiding acronyms and using the full names of the terms or phrases, the message is easier to understand.

NB: Track this.

Bad example: NB is unclear and old-fashioned

Well-known acronyms that we commonly use (FYI, URL, HTTPS, GIF, etc.) are more acceptable and safe to use.
