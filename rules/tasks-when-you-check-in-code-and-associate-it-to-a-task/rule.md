In Scrum you work only on tasks in a Sprint, and the task must belong to a committed PBI. As such, when you commit code in Azure DevOps (was TFS), you should associate it with the task you are working on rather than the PBI.

The reason behind this is that doing so provides a better way to track change sets in a Sprint and give full traceability for work done during the Sprint.
