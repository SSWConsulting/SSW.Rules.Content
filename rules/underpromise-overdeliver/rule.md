We’ve all experienced that awkward silence in a Sprint Review when the boss joins the call, expecting features to be done... and they’re not. Maybe the requirements weren’t clear, maybe a "quick fix" exploded into days of debugging. Whatever the cause, the result is the same: another commitment missed, and another dent in trust.

<!--endintro-->

When teams consistently overcommit and underdeliver, it breaks confidence with clients and stakeholders. Trust is hard-earned and easily lost, especially in high-budget, high-pressure environments.

## The planning fallacy is real

Humans are naturally optimistic when estimating how long tasks will take. This is known as the **planning fallacy**. We consistently underestimate our own work by 20–50%, and the more complex the task, the worse we get.

What’s interesting is we’re better at estimating how long **others** will take. This means we often set unrealistic expectations for ourselves.

## Why underpromising works

Underpromising and overdelivering flips this dynamic. Instead of making excuses later, you can:

* Build trust with consistent, reliable delivery
* Create positive surprises that strengthen client relationships
* Give your team breathing room for the inevitable unknowns

## Tips to apply this rule

### 1. Estimate realistically  

Avoid “sunshine estimates”. Add buffer time for the unknowns—because they **will** happen. Don’t just plan for the best-case; include the **expected** and **worst-case** as well.

### 2. Communicate clearly  

If you’re ahead of schedule, tell the client. If you're falling behind, say so early. Clients are forgiving when you’re transparent—radio silence is what causes frustration. This will help minimize surprises at the Sprint Review. See our rule on having [Corridor Conversations](/corridor-conversations)

### 3. Prioritize consistency over perfection  

You don't have to wow every Sprint. What clients value more is **predictability**. Be the team they can count on.

## Final thought

Software development is about more than code. It’s about **building trust**. And nothing builds trust faster than consistently delivering *more* than what you promised.
