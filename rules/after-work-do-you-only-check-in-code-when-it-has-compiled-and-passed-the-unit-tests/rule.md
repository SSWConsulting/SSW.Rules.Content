Too many people treat Source Control as a networked drive. Don't just check-in when the clock ticks past 5 or 6 o'clock. If code doesn't pass its unit tests or won't even compile put your code in a [shelveset](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms181403.aspx).

Other recommendations have included using "//TODO" or commenting the code out. However, we recommend avoiding this practice as it increases the risk that the code is forgotten about.

**Note:** Having [gated check-ins](/do-you-know-the-minimum-builds-to-create-for-your-project) will help prevent this from happening.

**Note:** A useful tool is [TFS Auto Shelve](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vercellone.TFSAutoShelveforVisualStudio2017) - Protect your code by guaranteeing your pending changes are always backed up to the TFS server.
