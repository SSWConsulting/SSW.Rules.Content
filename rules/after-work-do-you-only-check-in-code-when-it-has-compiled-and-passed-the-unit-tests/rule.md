<span class='intro'> Too many people treat Source Control as a networked drive. Don't just check-in when the clock ticks past 5 or 6 o'clock. If code doesn't pass its unit tests or won't even compile put your code in a <a shape="rect" href="http&#58;//msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms181403.aspx">shelveset</a>

However we recommend avoiding this practice as it increases the risk that the code is forgotten about. <br>
Note&#58; Having <a shape="rect" href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterVersionControlwithTFS%28AKASourceControl%29.aspx#MinimumBuilds">gated check-ins </a>will help prevent this from happening. <br>
