<span class='intro'> ​When you do a major (or minor)&#160;upgrade to an&#160;application, you should let people know and identify the reason for the upgrade.<br> </span>

<p>Whether your upgrade is to take advantage of a new feature, to fix a bug, or even just to keep yourself on the latest and greatest version, your followers might want to know why you upgraded. You should put a short announcement on Twitter, Facebook, and/or LinkedIn. Your followers may not know about the changes and the ones who are grateful are likely to retweet or like your post. ​</p><dl class="goodImage"><dt><img src="octopus_upgrade.png" alt="octopus_upgrade.png" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good Example - announcing the upgrade with a short note of the new feature​<br></dd></dl>
