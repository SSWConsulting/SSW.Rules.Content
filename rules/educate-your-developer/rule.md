To ensure that developers have a clear understanding of how permissions are granted, it's important to educate them on the process.

<!--endintro-->

## Steps to effectively educate your developers



* Start by explaining the importance of granting permissions correctly and securely.

* Show developers how to navigate to the appropriate access control section in the relevant platform (e.g., Azure, AWS, SharePoint).

* Demonstrate how to select the specific resource or application for which permissions need to be granted.

* Emphasize the principle of least privilege and guide developers on granting only the necessary permissions.

* Provide examples of common scenarios where specific permissions are required and explain how to grant them.

* Encourage developers to ask questions and seek clarification during the process.

* Highlight the importance of regularly reviewing and updating permissions to maintain security.

* Document the process in a rule or knowledge base to serve as a reference for future developers.
