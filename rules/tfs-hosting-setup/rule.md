### How to Download Builds from your Build Server

When transferring files from the isolated build server, the **SFTP** protocol is used, which is **Secure File Transfer Protocol**, an encrypted file transfer method.

You will need a client that supports SFTP to be able to transfer files. We recommend FileZilla, a free client available for download here: FileZilla Client Download

After you have downloaded and installed FileZilla, follow these steps to connect to the build server and download your builds:

1. Choose **File | Site Manager**
2. Click **New Site**, and enter the name for the new site (eg. Build Server)
3. Enter the following details:
