There are certain links on a website which you want to make       VERY simple for users to find. I hate hunting around on a       site for a phone numbers. These are the basics which should       be easily accessible from every page:

* Home page (top left corner)
* Contact Us (with a phone number, not a form.submit!)
* News (especially for journalists)
* Directions (so prospects and clients can come and 
     visit!)
