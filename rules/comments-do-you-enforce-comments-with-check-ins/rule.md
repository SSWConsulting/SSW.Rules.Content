Team Foundation Server is great, and one of its neat features is enforcing comments when checking in code. Without comments, some of the other built in features like History become redundant without comments.

You should have good comments... if you are struggling use [Excuses For Lazy Coders](http://programmingexcuses.com/) :)

In Visual Studio 2013, to enforce this behaviour, you will need to:

![Figure: Go to Team Explorer | Source Control](15-07-2014 10-41-30 AM.png)

![Figure: Then Check-in Policy | Add](15-07-2014 10-42-21 AM.png)

![Figure: Then select Changeset Comments Policy and OK](15-07-2014 10-42-43 AM.png)

![Figure: Now you have the Changeset Comments Policy applied to your Team Project](15-07-2014 10-42-56 AM.png)

Now the next time someone checks-in some code, they are forced to enter a comment.
