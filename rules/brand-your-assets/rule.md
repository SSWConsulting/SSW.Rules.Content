You should take every chance you get to put your logo on things. Read on for the best way to do that:

<!--endintro-->

Branding your assets is one more thing that you can do to spread your brand to the world. For example, if you provide your team with laptops, those laptops should be branded with your logo, so they can be seen when they visit a client. This is especially important when assets already have another brand on them - we don't want to accidentally promote someone else when we could be promoting ourselves.

You have this opportunity for any asset owned by your business.

1. You should brand important items like laptops with a custom skin
2. If you don't have a custom skin, you should use a sticker

Tip: For items like laptops, it's also a good idea to tape your business card underneath so it can be returned to you if you lose it.
