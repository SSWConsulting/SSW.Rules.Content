​​You should take every chance you get to put your logo on things. <br><div><br></div>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>Branding your assets is one more thing that you can do to spread your brand to the world. For example, if you provide your team with laptops, it's nice to have those laptops branded with your business logo, so they can be seen when they visit a client.</p><p>​Basically, you can have that on any asset owned by your business. Items like monitors, laptops and computers branded with a sticker with your logo are all opportunities for more branding.</p><p>For items like laptops, it can also be a good idea to tape your business card below the sticker so it can be returned to you if you lose it.​<br></p><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureNormal"><img src="MicrosoftTeams-image (7).png" alt="MicrosoftTeams-image (7).png" style="margin:5px;width:808px;" />Figure: Sticker proving that you should take every chance to show off your brand<br></dd></dl><p></p><div class="ssw15-rteElement-ContentBlock-SSW-Only">- ​​​If your laptop is owned by SSW (this also means Salary Sacrifice computers that have not been fully paid yet), make sure it has a sticker on the back with its name and image (preferred), or at least a little SSW sticker on it.<br>- ​​If it doesn't have the sticker, ask for your Office admin for a sticker or send an email and ask for help to SSWSysAdmins (SSWSysAdmins@ssw.com.au).​<br></div><p><br></p>
