It is important that while you're upgrading, nobody can check in.  Any check-ins after you backup your database will be lost.

To make sure that nobody can change anything during the upgrade, follow these steps.

<!--endintro-->

a.               Send out an email notifying everyone TFS will be unavailable for the upgrade period
 Follow [Rules to better Networks](http://www.ssw.com.au/SSW/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterNetworks.aspx#rebootrestart)

b.              Make sure nobody can check in files:

c.                Open the TFS Administration Console on the server.

d.               Navigate to Application Tier / Team Project Collections.

e.              For each Team Project Collection, select it, and click "Stop Collection". Enter a useful message (this will be displayed to users trying to connect from Visual Studio) and click "Stop":

f.               In Visual Studio, confirm you can no longer connect to TFS
