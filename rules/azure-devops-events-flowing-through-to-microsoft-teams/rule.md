You can see details about your Azure DevOps Server (formerly known as TFS) projects directly in your Microsoft Teams channel. Examples of what you can monitor:

* Work item updates
* Pull requests
* Code commits
* Builds
* Release deployments and approvals

Also bring your Azure DevOps Services Kanban board directly into Microsoft Teams as a tab.
