You should always try and reply to emails within a timely period, but&#160;this is not always possible.<br>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>Sometimes people see an email 6-months old and just delete it because it's &quot;too old&quot; or&#160;refuse to reply because &quot;the customer will think we're a joke taking this long to do something!&quot; This is a great way to lose business, no matter how long it takes to do some tasks, it's always better to do it than not.</p><p>Example&#58;&#160;An enhancement suggestion for a particular product that&#160;is put&#160;on the backlog&#160;until other important issues are dealt with. It might take 12 months to implement that change, but when it's done&#160;the customer should be informed and get a link to the new version - it's possible that their need still exists, and they'll know that their ideas and suggestions are not ignored. </p>
<p>Reply to emails&#160;regardless of how long it takes to respond. It shows you value the sender's&#160;feedback.<br></p><p><b>Note&#58; </b>When replying to these&#160;old emails, make sure you mention the reasons why it took so long. E.g.​&#160;&quot;I know it’s been a while, but&#160;we had other&#160;priorities in the past months. As per <a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=be7e0c48-127a-43f0-9f85-6fa3fb71e885">the rule 'better late than ever'</a>&#160;I'm making sure you know it's now done&quot;<i></i><br></p>
