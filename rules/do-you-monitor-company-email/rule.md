<span class='intro'> 
Following from the previous rule, if email is actually the property of the employer, then it makes sense to actually track who is sending emails to whom. 
 </span>


  <p>Using the Microsoft Exchange Web Storage System, you should&#160;track the number of emails sent internally (i.e. to a colleague) and emails sent to clients in your&#160;corporate database.</p>

<p>We use a <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/ExchangeReporter/">Utility for Exchange Reports</a> called SSW Exchange Reporter.</p>
<p>Note that although it is acceptable for seniors to check juniors' email, it is not acceptable for juniors to check seniors' email.</p>
