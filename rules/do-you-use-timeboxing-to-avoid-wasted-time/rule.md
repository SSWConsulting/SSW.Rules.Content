<p>
   <br>&#160;</p><p>​Timeboxing allows you to give more context to a task by showing how much time (and therefore money) you are willing to spend. This typically applies to&#58;</p><ul><li>&quot;Nice to Haves&quot; -&#160;If it takes too long, don't worry about it.</li><li>Risky tasks&#160;- I'm not sure this will even work, if you can't figure it out, don't worry about it.</li><li>Unknowns - This could take 2 minutes or 2 days. If it takes too long don't worry about it.</li></ul><p>&#160;</p><div style="overflow&#58;hidden;">
