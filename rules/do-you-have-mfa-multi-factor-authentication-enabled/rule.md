Do you protect your users and administrator accounts with more than one authentication method?

<!--endintro-->

What is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)?

MFA is another layer of security for your users and administrators, it adds another 'password' or code that you can receive in a device that you possess - a phone, for example - to make it more difficult for attackers to steal your account.
If they guess or brute-force your password, they still need the second code to make it to your account.

Generally, every time you log in on a service, it will ask for your normal password and an additional code. This code can be retrieved through an authenticator app, through an SMS, or even through a phone call to your mobile.

It is best practice to apply MFA to your Administrators first, as their accounts are the most important on the company and have access to all resources, and your users second, which still benefits from added security.
