We don't like hard coded string inside our programme. We are using model-driven development, in which we create or reuse code, and perform changes in configuration file rather the in-code changing. [More information on implementing our configuration](/Pages/ConfigurationManagementAppBlock.aspx).   
<!--endintro-->


```
connection.ConnectionString = "
Provider=SQLOLEDB;
Data Source=server_name_or_address; Initial Catalog=database_name;
User ID=username; Password=password; ";

   connection.Open();
```

Bad code - use the lengthy connection string.

```
connection.ConnectionString = ConfigurationManager.Items["ConnectionString"];

 connection.Open();
```

Figure: Good Code - Use ConfigurationManager to handle the connection string.

| We have a program called [SSW Code Auditor](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/Default.aspx) to check for this rule.  |
