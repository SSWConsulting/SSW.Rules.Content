Facebook has a call-to-action feature that helps Pages drive business objectives. These call-to-action buttons link to any destination on or off Facebook that aligns with a business’s goals.

Page admins can select from a group of call-to-action buttons:



* Book Now
* Contact Us
* Use App
* Play Game
* Shop Now
* Sign Up
* Watch Video
