Migrating from Google Workspace to Office 365 involves a significant transfer of data, including emails, contacts, calendars, and files. A manual approach can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Utilizing a specialized migration tool, such as CodeTwo, can simplify the entire process, ensuring a smooth and secure transition to Office 365.

## Google Workspace to Office 365 Migration: Opt for Efficiency with the Right Tools
 
Always use a professional migration tool when transferring data from Google Workspace to Office 365. Manual migration should be avoided as it can lead to data loss and significant downtime.

Manual migration of data, where an IT administrator manually copies files and emails between accounts. This process is error-prone and inefficient.  Users also have downtime while the email is transferred.

Using a migration tool like CodeTwo for transferring data from Google Workspace to Office 365. This tool automates the entire process, reduces errors, and provides logs and reports for monitoring the migration status.  Emails can be transferred in a staged approach which drastically reduces labour and downtime.

**Warning:**  
Google has removed the ability to perform migrations using just the username and password. Each user must generate an 'app password' and explicitly enable all labels for IMAP in their Google account settings before a migration can begin. This change necessitates additional preparation steps to ensure a seamless data transfer.

:::
**Reason:**  
Migration tools are specifically designed to handle large datasets and complex data structures efficiently. They maintain data integrity, provide error checking and recovery options, and significantly reduce the manpower needed for the migration process.

**Exceptions:**  
- Small businesses with minimal data may opt for manual migration if budget constraints do not allow for the use of paid tools.
- When only a small subset of data (like select files or folders) needs to be migrated, manual transfer might be more practical.
