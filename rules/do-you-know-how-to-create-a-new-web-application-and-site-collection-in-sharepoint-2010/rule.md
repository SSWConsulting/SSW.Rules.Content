We are now ready to make a new web application and site collection which we will need to match closely to the original SharePoint 2007 server. In the SharePoint 2010 server:

1. Open  **SharePoint Central Administration** |  **Manage web applications**
2. Click on  **New**
3. Enter in the details for the web application using the document from the rule Do you document the details of your SharePoint 2007 web application?
4. Go back to  **SharePoint Central Administration** | **Create site collections**
5. Fill out the form to create a new site collection – the only option that is important here is to create a  **site collection that matches the site collection you will be migration.** Eg: If the site collection you are migrating is a Team Site, make a site collection that is a Team Site.


Note: The rest do not matter as they will be replaced when you restore the database from SharePoint 2007.
