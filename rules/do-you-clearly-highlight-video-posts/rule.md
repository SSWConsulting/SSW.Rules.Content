<span class='intro'> <p><span style="line-height&#58;20.8px;">We all know the feeling after a long day...</span><span style="line-height&#58;20.8px;">&#160;</span><span style="line-height&#58;20.8px;">Exhausted</span><span style="line-height&#58;20.8px;">,</span><span style="line-height&#58;20.8px;">&#160;we wander the internet</span><span style="line-height&#58;20.8px;">,</span><span style="line-height&#58;20.8px;">&#160;lazily looking for content to consume easily.</span><span style="line-height&#58;20.8px;">&#160;For many</span><span style="line-height&#58;20.8px;">,</span><span style="line-height&#58;20.8px;">&#160;this normally takes the form of watching videos after trailing through their Reddit, Twitter, &amp; other social media platforms. Therefore, it is important to make sure that your blog post titles stand out to this demographic.</span></p> </span>

<p>One simple way to do this is to make sure that the first word of your blog post is &quot;<b>VIDEO â€“ </b>&quot;.&#160;</p><dl class="badImage"><dt><img src="Stevo-Bad-blog.png" alt="Stevo-Bad-blog.png" /></dt><dd>Bad example&#58; Great content, but from the title you would be unable to tell that this is a video&#160; </dd></dl> <dl class="goodImage"> <dt><img src="Chris-Good-blog.png" alt="Chris-Good-blog.png" /> </dt><dd> Good example&#58; Easy to see from the title that this includes a video</dd></dl>
