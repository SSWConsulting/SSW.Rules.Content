<span class='intro'> <p>Usually, when you notice some undesirable behaviour, you would generally give feedback directly, but sometimes there is a better way that can train both the&#160;person and also their direct manager&#58;​<br></p> </span>

<p>You can ask a manager for an &quot;off the record&quot; conversation where you can tell them something you have observed about the person they're managing and suggest that, if they agree, can they say something to the person?&#160;</p><p>This teaches the manager to observe these things and also helps the employee not to look bad (or get in trouble) from the boss. Then when/if the employee takes the feedback and it results in better actions in the next meeting, then you can compliment them publicly in the retro.<br></p>
