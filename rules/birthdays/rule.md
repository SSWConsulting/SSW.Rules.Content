Imagine being the person who has to scramble for a last-minute cake or hunt for obscure Serbian food because someone‚Äôs birthday popped up without warning. Now multiply that by two or three birthdays a week.

That might seem manageable in a small team, but it quickly becomes unscalable as your company grows. Celebrating every birthday on the exact day sounds nice in theory‚Äîbut it drains time, attention, and money.

### Make birthdays scalable

Celebrating birthdays is important‚Äîit shows appreciation and builds team morale. But like any good process, it should scale as your team grows.

Here are some common approaches:

---

### üéÇ Option A ‚Äì Same-day celebration

This is the classic approach: celebrate someone‚Äôs birthday on the actual day with cake or a special lunch.

#### Why it‚Äôs not scalable

* Hard to maintain once you have 1+ birthday per week
* Easy to forget or miss someone
* Last-minute planning stresses whoever is responsible

**Use this only if:**  
You have a very small team (fewer than 10 people) and someone *loves* managing birthday logistics.

---

### üéÅ Option B ‚Äì Let individuals choose how they celebrate

Some teams give the birthday person a choice‚Äîe.g. pick the Friday lunch venue, get a small gift, or have a shout-out.

#### Why it may/may not work

* Adds admin complexity‚Äîrequires someone to follow up and remember preferences
* Not all team members enjoy making these decisions
* Still requires manual coordination

**Use this if:**  
Your culture is very personalized and you can handle the overhead.

---

### ‚úÖ Option C ‚Äì Monthly grouped celebrations (Recommended)

Group all birthdays into a single celebration at the **end of each month**, ideally during something already on the calendar (e.g. Friday Free Lunch).

#### Why this works best

* Scales well as your team grows
* No one gets forgotten
* Easy to delegate and automate

The best way to do this is with a **monthly summary email** to the organizers using an **automated Power Automate flow**, scheduled for the **last Monday of each month**.
