Imagine walking into the kitchen and seeing a plain supermarket sponge cake with a “Happy Birthday” scrawled in icing... but no one knows whose birthday it is, and no one really cares.

By putting just a little thought into how you celebrate birthdays, you can turn a routine gesture into something that genuinely boosts morale and brings people together.

### Make birthdays meaningful

The best birthday celebrations are low-cost but high-impact, and they give the birthday person a little control.

#### ❌ Don't just buy a cake

A birthday cake sounds like a nice idea, but it’s often a one-size-fits-all solution that doesn’t actually fit anyone. People have different tastes, dietary needs, or simply don’t want a big deal made. Worse, it can feel impersonal if it’s just a habit.

This often happens when someone's birthday is forgotten until the day 😮.

#### ✅ Let them get something personal

Better than a generic celebration, giving someone a cool priviledge that week is a better way to celebrate.

Some companies do free lunch on Fridays - a good example would be to let the birthday employee pick the free lunch food for that week.

### General tips

* Ask how each person prefers to celebrate (the might not want to celebrate)
* Include a short “Happy Birthday” shout-out sometime that week
* Don’t make a big deal if they’re uncomfortable with attention
