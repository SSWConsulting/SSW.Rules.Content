<span class='intro'> <p>There are two types of bullet list. The first type of bullet list is the
 most common, where each bullet point is a sentence fragment that will 
form a complete sentence if read together with the introductory line. 
For this type, place full stop at the end of the last point. For 
example&#58;</p> </span>

<div class="greyBox"><p>UI may refer to&#58;</p><ul><li>User interface</li><li>User interaction.</li></ul></div><p>The second type is when each bullet point is a full sentence. It features a capital letter at the start and a full stop at the end of each bullet point. For example&#58;</p><div class="greyBox"><p>User Interface Fundamentals&#58;</p><ul><li>Your design should make simple, common tasks simple to do, communicating clearly and simply in the user's own language, and providing good shortcuts that are meaningfully related to longer procedures.</li><li>Your design should keep all needed options and materials for a given task visible without distracting the user with extraneous or redundant information. Good designs don't overwhelm users with too many alternatives or confuse them with unneeded information.</li><li>Your design should keep users informed of actions or interpretations, changes of state or condition, and errors or exceptions that are relevant and of interest to the user through clear, concise, and unambiguous language familiar to users.</li></ul></div>
