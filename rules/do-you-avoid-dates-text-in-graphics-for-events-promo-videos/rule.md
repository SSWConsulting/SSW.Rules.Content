To maximize reusability and minimize costs, it’s best to avoid including dates as text in graphics for promotional videos.

<!--endintro-->


::: bad  
![Figure: Bad example - dates shown as text in graphics (creates extra work to change every time)](events-dates-bad.png)  
:::


::: good  
![Figure: Good example - no dates shown as text in graphics (can be re-used without editing)](events-dates-good.png)  
:::

If there is some particular value/purpose in including dates there may be exceptions to this rule.
