One of the key challenges for a business is ensuring that its webpages are favored by search engines. It's a delicate balance between providing value to your audience and ticking the right boxes for search engine algorithms.
This webpage template is tailored to incorporate best SEO practices. Using this when you create a webpage ensures that it starts with a solid baseline SEO. This can also reduce the future pain of reworking existing pages that weren't created with SEO in mind.

Replace all the placeholders with information about the new page:

Template: if the page should follow an existing template, put it here (if not, write N/A). If you don't know where the template is but you have an example you'd like to follow (e.g. another Consulting page), put the link here.

{{ PAGE TEMPLATE }}<br><br>

Page Title: Must be descriptive and include primary keywords (Google-able). It should be no more than 60 characters.

{{ PAGE TITLE }}<br><br>

Meta Description: This is the preview that users see on Google (or other search engines). It must be a unique and clear summary of the page. It should also incorporate the primary keyword and other secondary keywords. It should be between 120-160 characters. If you have trouble making this, give ChatGPT your content and ask it to write one for you!

{{ META DESCRIPTION }}<br><br>

URI: Must be concise, clear, and should include the primary keywords. Use kebab case (e.g. use-dashes-and-lowercase)

{{ URI }}<br><br>

Internal Links (If applicable, include related links on the page):

{{ RELATED URLS }}<br><br>

Content guidelines:

* Headings – include an HTML title tag for each heading, with H1 for the main title H2 for subheadings, H3 for smaller subheadings

   * Only one H1 per page
   * The H1 should summarize the main content
   * Each heading must include keywords
   * Example:
      * H1 – SSW Educational
      * H2 - How SSW can help: Customized technology solutions

* Images – must include both alt text and descriptive captions
   * Alt text describes the image to search engines
   * Example:
      * <cat-flying.jpg>
      * Alt text - cat flying above city
      * Caption - Figure: A cat soars majestically above New York City.

Write/paste the content here, following the above guidelines for headings and images:
