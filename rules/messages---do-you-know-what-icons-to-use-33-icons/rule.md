<span class='intro'> <h4>Icon</h4>
<div>Including an icon is important because not only does it give the user a visual indication of the type of message, but without it only the Default beep sound is used. The icon should reflect the type of information being presented&#58;</div> </span>

<td><strong>NEVER</strong> use this.&#160; <br>According to Microsoft, the Question mark is being phased out, as any of the other three&#58; Error, Warning or Information can easily be reworded into a Question, and Question does not show the user the severity of the issue that has just occurred.<br>E.g.&#160; If you want to ask the user whether they want to save a file before closing, you should use the Warning Icon. </td></tr></tbody></table>
