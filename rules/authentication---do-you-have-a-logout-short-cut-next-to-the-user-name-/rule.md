Although most of the sites have a 'Log off' submenu, we recommend adding a short                     cut next to the user name, this will make the 'log Off' operation more convenient.

<!--endintro-->
<dl class="badImage">&lt;dt&gt;
                        <img src="logoff-bad.jpg" alt="Bad example - only has a 'Log Off'">&lt;/dt&gt;<dd>
                        Figure: Bad example - Only has a 'Log Off' operation in the submenu</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage">&lt;dt&gt;
                        <img src="logoff-good.jpg" alt="Good example - has a 'Logout'">&lt;/dt&gt;<dd>
                        Figure: Good example - Has a 'Logout' short cut next to the user name</dd></dl>
