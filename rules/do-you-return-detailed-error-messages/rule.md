Good error design is as important to the sucess of an API as the API design itself. A good error message provides context and visibility on how to troubleshoot and resolve issues at critical times.

<!--endintro-->

### For REST, start by using the correct HTTP Status Codes...


The HTTP/1.1 RFC lists over 70 different HTTP Status Codes. Very few developers will be able to remember all of them, so it pays to keep it simple and use the most common Status Codes. The basic rule is to use the following three:

* **200 OK** - Everything worked. Success
* **400 Bad Request** - The consuming application did something wrong.
* **500 Internal Server Error** - The API Application did something wrong.


### ...And then include the problem details


RFC 7807 - Problem Details for HTTP APIs (ietf.org) details the specification for returning errors from your API. The HTTP Status Codes are an excellent start - they immediately tell you *where*the problem is, but they don't tell you *what*the problem is.

ASP.Net Core has built in support for the problem details specification. You can see more at the official documentation. Handle errors in ASP.NET Core web APIs | Microsoft Docs

### And for any API:

### Make your error messages as verbose as necessary...

Error messages should contain a sufficient level of information that a developer or consuming client can act upon.



```
{
    "errorMessage": "An error has occurred."
}
```

{

}
```

### ...But no more verbose than that

### Provide a Tracking or Correlation ID

A tracking or correlation ID will allow the consuming clients to provide the API developers with a reference point in their logs.



```
{
    "errorMessage": "An error has occurred. Please contact technical support"
}
```




::: bad
Figure: Bad Example - No tracking or correlation ID is provided.

}
```

### Provide an additional Help Resource

Providing a URI to an additional help resources as part of your request will allow consuming clients to find additional resources or documentation that relates to the defined problem.
