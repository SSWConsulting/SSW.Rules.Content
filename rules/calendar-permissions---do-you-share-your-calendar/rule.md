Within a company, there are occasions that you are not able to access your computer to send sick emails, or you get a call from your client on the way to the office that you have to drive to a client site straight away; when such things happen, you need someone else to update your calendar when you call in, so others are aware of your availabilities.

<!--endintro-->

So always make sure the admin people are able to access your calendar with full permission in order to add/edit/delete appointments for you.
<dl class="image">&lt;dt&gt; 
      <img src="Share-Calendar.jpg" alt="Click on Calendar Permissions" style="width:800px;height:503px;"> 
      <br> 
   &lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: Click on "Calendar Permissions"<br></dd></dl><dl class="image">&lt;dt&gt;
      <img src="Permissions.jpg" alt="Permissions.jpg" style="margin:5px;">
   <br>&lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: Give admins full access to your calendar</dd></dl>
Once the permission is given, open other people's calendar is as easy as 2 steps:

1. Go to the Calendar tab in outlook and click "open a Shared Calendar"
<dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureNormal"><img src="Shared-Calendar.jpg" alt="Shared-Calendar.jpg" style="color:#333333;margin:5px;width:800px;height:503px;">Figure: Opening a shared calendar<br></dd>


<dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea">2. Choose the calendar you want to open in the pop-up form:<br><img src="SSWAbsence.jpg" alt="SSWAbsence.jpg" style="color:#333333;margin:5px;"></dl>
Figure: Find the calendar you want


Then you can have this shared calendar shown in your Outlook.
