When the noise in an open plan office goes beyond appropriate levels, it could be annoying and stressful and thereby affects productivity. Here’re a few tips to help reduce noise in your workplace.

1. Use headphones🎧
2. Use a reasonable voice level or soft voice.
3. Type in the important points during the conversation to your teams/private chat box to avoid unnecessary repetition and at the same time have those points written not just spoken.
4. Should you anticipate a long call, move into a private room or booth if you can.
5. Ping very loud people politely/nicely, e.g., “Hey buddy, could you please use headphones”.
6. Close your booth/pod door (if you have one) while you’re in calls.
