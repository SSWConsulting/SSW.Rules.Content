It is good practice to be clear on what you want. One way you can make things clearer is to number tasks or questions.

**Note:** Receiving an email with just numbered items is cold - An email starting with a paragraph of context is much nicer

### Hi Bob,

We’ll commence the meeting at our office where we can provide you with an overview of the SSW operation, and then discuss in more detail the Northwind solution and how we can partner to make it a success.

How many attendees from will be attending on the meeting day? Are you able to stay for dinner or lunch with our team? Would you like to see some sights while you’re in town?

I have a few more questions about the day to help me and the team prepare:

1. How many attendees from will be attending on the meeting day?

2. Are you able to stay for dinner or lunch with our team?

3. Would you like to see some sights while you’re in town?

It can be very productive to walk around and take in the sights while discussing business matters. Some of the attractions that we could visit include:

1. The Template of Yue Fei,

2. The Zhejiang Art Museum, and

3. The Hangzhou Botanical Guardens.

Bad example - Confusing! The second list above is unnecessary and obscures the tasks/questions
