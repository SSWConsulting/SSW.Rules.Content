<span class='intro'> <p>To help maintain order and control in your Azure environment, applying tags to resources and resources groups is the way to go.<br></p><p>Azure has the Tag feature, which allows you to apply different Tag Names and values to Resources and Resource Groups&#58;​<br></p> </span>

<p>You can leverage this feature to organize your resources in a logical way, not relying in the names only. E.g.<br></p><ul><li><b>Owner tag&#58;</b> You can specify who owns that resource</li><li><b>Environment tag&#58; </b>You can specify which environment that resource is in</li></ul><p><b>Tip&#58;</b> Do not forget to have a strong naming convention document stating how those tags and resources should be named. You can use this Microsoft guide as a starter point&#58;
