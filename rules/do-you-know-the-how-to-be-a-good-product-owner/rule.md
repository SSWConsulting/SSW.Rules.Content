The client is generally the Product Owner (PO). They should read the Scrum Guide and watch the Product Owner video to understand their role. It is so important to the success of their project:

# What are the key factors for a good Product Owner?

## Strong Understanding of the Product Vision

The PO should have a clear and deep understanding of the product's vision, goals, and business value. They should be able to articulate this vision to the development team and stakeholders.

## Decision-Making Authority

The PO must have the authority to make decisions regarding product features, priorities, and scope. They should be empowered by the client organization to act decisively.

## Excellent Communication Skills

The ability to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders is essential. They should translate business needs into technical requirements and convey technical complexities back
to the business in a clear manner.

## Prioritization Skills

A good PO excels at backlog management, making tough decisions on what to prioritize based on the business's needs and available resources. Through this they can Prioritize the Product Backlog so that the important things will be done first, in order to maximize the ROI as the budget will run out one day.

## Availability and Commitment

The PO needs to be available to the team regularly to answer questions, provide feedback, and make decisions quickly. Their commitment to the project is crucial for maintaining momentum. A good PO has a feeling of urgency!
They should be available for [Sprint Reviews](/do-you-know-what-happens-at-a-sprint-review-meeting), [Retrospectives](/do-you-know-what-happens-at-a-sprint-retrospective-meeting) and [Sprint Planning](/what-happens-at-a-sprint-planning-meeting) meetings (approximately half a day for these 3 meetings, for each 2-week Sprint). Ideally, they should also listen in on [Daily Scrums](/methodology-daily-scrums). This is optional but means that the PO will have daily insight into the team’s progress.

## User-Centric Mindset

They should focus on delivering value to the end-users, balancing business needs with user satisfaction.

## Collaboration and Negotiation Skills

The PO must work closely with stakeholders, developers, and the Scrum Master to ensure everyone is aligned. They should be adept at negotiating scope and timelines when necessary.
They should also understand Product Backlog Items (PBIs) and be able to explain what they want using [Acceptance Criteria](/acceptance-criteria). This is the main way that developers and POs sync their understanding of what needs to be done.

**Note:** It is helpful for developers to distinguish acceptance criteria between what is considered "essential" and what is merely "nice to have," as this can prevent them from investing excessive time in meeting non-essential criteria.

## Agile Experience

Prior experience in Agile methodologies, especially Scrum, is beneficial. They should understand Agile principles and practices to work effectively with the Scrum team.

## Set Team Goals

The Product Owner is responsible for setting a clear Product Goal, which defines the long-term purpose or "why" of the product.
For each Sprint, they agree on a [Sprint Goal](/sprint-forecast) with the team, focusing on the most important outcome for that iteration.
The Product Owner ensures that the team stays focused on the Sprint Goal and works only on the items in the Sprint Backlog. Any new requests should be deferred to future sprints to maintain team focus and avoid distractions.

# Who should be the Product Owner?

It is recommended that the Product Owner is from the client. There are several reasons for this.

## Deep Business Knowledge

A client-side PO typically has a strong understanding of the business, its goals, and its customers. They are more likely to have insights into the strategic priorities and the nuances of the market the product serves.

## Stakeholder Relationships

They already have established relationships with key stakeholders, which can facilitate smoother communication and decision-making.

## Long-term Vision

As an insider, they are more likely to be invested in the long-term success of the product, beyond just the current project scope.

## Quick Decision-Making

A client-side PO may have faster access to executives and other decision-makers, which can speed up the approval process for changes or feature prioritization.

It’s possible to outsource the role of PO to someone in the development consulting company, but this is not recommended ("don’t put the fox in charge of the chickens").

Being a PO can seem duanting to some, especially if they don't have a lot of Scrum experience. It is recommended that all PO's read the Scrum Guide, watched the Product Owner video, and understand the role.

It is also recommended that the Scrum Master is from the development consultant company and supports the Product Owner in the Agile practices. See [Does your Scrum Master support the Product Owner](/scrum-master-support-product-owner)
