Each venue is a little different and has different requirements. Don’t expect presenters to know how each user group runs, especially if the user group organisers will not be available on the day/night.

For example:

### Sydney .NET User Group Presenter Information

1. Presenters will require a HDMI output, you will need an adaptor if you do not have this output.


### Canberra .NET User Group Presenter Information


1. Presenters can use full-size HDMI, Mini-display port or USB-C to project. There is a monitor on the lectern which duplicates the projector        screen, so it is possible to use “Presenter Mode” if you want to.
2. Wifi is available on the MSFTGUEST network, but you will need the reception staff or MS sponsor to create an event access code that you      can use to authenticate.
3. Attendees arrive around 5:30. Meet-and-greet until 5:45, then start the user group.


Brisbane .NET User Group Presenter Information


1. Presenters will require a HDMI output, you will need an adaptor if you do not have this output.


### Melbourne .NET User Group Presenter Information

1. Presenters will require a HDMI output, you will need an adaptor if you do not have this output.
