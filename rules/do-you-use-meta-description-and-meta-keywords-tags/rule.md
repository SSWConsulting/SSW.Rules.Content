<span class='intro'> <p>One of the easiest ways to get the ball rolling with your web pages and being noticed by search engines is to use &lt;meta&gt; tags. Search engines use &lt;meta&gt; tags to categorize your website's content. Many web masters took this as an opportunity to abuse the &lt;meta&gt; tags and the earlier less sophisticated search engines found that the quality of search results was suffering. Luckily today's search engines like Google don't give the &lt;meta&gt; tags so much weight when determining search engine results pages. In any case, we know that search engines do consider them so we think it would be silly to overlook such a quick and easy task to complete.</p> </span>

There are many kinds of META tags you should use, These are the most common&#58;<br><ul><li><span style="line-height&#58;20px;">META DESCRIPTION&#58; Search engines will often use the information in the META DESCRIPTION tag as well as the TITLE to describe your site in the short description that goes along with the link in your search engine rankings.</span><br></li><li><span style="line-height&#58;20px;">META KEYWORDS&#58; This hold words that you can use to help search engines classify your content.
