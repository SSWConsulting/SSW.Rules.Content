Unless we're currently working on the last Sprint of the development, you should always book the next Sprint as soon as you start work on the current one. 
<!--endintro-->

This is done during the [Planning meeting](/do-you-know-what-happens-at-a-sprint-planning-meeting) and will ensure the availability of the developers who are up to speed on your project and stop them from being booked onto something else.

![Figure: If you have booked the guys in, you will have an appointment like this in your Outlook](Scheduled_Appointment.jpg)
