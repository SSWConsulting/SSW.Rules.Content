Unless we're currently working on the last sprint of the development, you should always book the next sprint as soon as you start work on the current one. 
<!--endintro-->

This is done during the [planning meeting](/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/SprintPlanning%28WHAT%29Meeting.aspx)and will ensure the availability of the developers who are up to speed on your project and stop them from being booked onto something else.

Figure: If you have booked the guys in, you will have an appointment like this in your Outlook.
