Unless we're currently working on the last sprint of the development, you should always book the next sprint as soon as you start work on the current one.

Hagas

This is done during the [planning meeting](/do-you-know-what-happens-at-a-sprint-planning-meeting) and will ensure the availability of the developers who are up to speed on your project and stop them from being booked onto something else.
