When you seek advice or help from another, firstly, you need to establish with them:  
<!--endintro-->

* Your understanding and,
* Methods you have previously attempted in order to resolve the problem


Tip: Be aware that you don't want them to reply with http://www.lmgtfy.com

![IM Icon](../../assets/ImIcon.jpg) How do you xxxx?  Figure: Bad Example - By not stating what you have previously attempted to resolve the problem, the person you are seeking advice from may be wasting time if they suggest methods you have already done. I have searched Google but no luck... How do you xxxx?  Figure: Good Example - The person you are seeking advice from will not suggest for you to do the same methods again and will look for other ways to resolve the issue.
