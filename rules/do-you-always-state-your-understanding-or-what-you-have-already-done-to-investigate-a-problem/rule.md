When you seek advice or help from another, firstly, you need to establish with them:  
<!--endintro-->

* Your understanding and,
* Methods you have previously attempted in order to resolve the problem


Tip: Be aware that you don't want them to reply with http://www.lmgtfy.com

<dd>Figure: Bad Example - By not stating what you have previously attempted to resolve the problem, the person you are seeking advice from may be wasting time if they suggest methods you have already done.</dd></dl><dl class="good">&lt;dt&gt;I have searched Google but no luck... How do you xxxx? &lt;/dt&gt;
<dd>Figure: Good Example - The person you are seeking advice from will not suggest for you to do the same methods again and will look for other ways to resolve the issue.</dd></dl>
