Thumbnails are a great way of telling your (potential) viewers what your video is about and why they should watch it. It is therefore important that these stand out from the others.

<!--endintro-->

A thumbnail can draw attention by:



* Using bright colors and avoiding using the YouTube colors (white, black, red) so you donâ€™t bend in.
* Being custom ([90% of the best performing videos on YouTube have custom thumbnails](https://creatoracademy.youtube.com/page/lesson/thumbnails#strategies-zippy-link-2)).
* Using big bold titles (30 characters maximum, remember a thumbnail is small).
* Feature your main keyword in the title


YouTube offers [resources to create better custom thumbnails](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/72431?hl=en) including image size and resolution, policies, etc.

::: bad
Bad example: despite looking "trustworthy", a thumbnail automatically generated from the video is not engaging enough.

::: good
Good example: a custom thumbnail looks professional and already gives important information about the content of the video.
