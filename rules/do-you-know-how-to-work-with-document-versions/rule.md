This is how you should work with Document Versions:

<!--endintro-->

1. Make sure your document library is configured to use versioning. TIP: You can configure this in **Settings | Versioning Settings**
2. Make sure you are showing the version column in your document view.  
![TIP: You can add the column by selecting Modify View](VersionColumn_Small.jpg)
3. Whenever you edit the document and check it in, SharePoint will automatically increase the version number. If you need to send this document to a client then it is important to:
    1. Save the file locally by selecting **Send To | Download a Copy**    
![](SaveFileLocally_Small.jpg)
    2. Add the version to the end of the filename e.g. Specifications\_v2.0.docx
    3. Then email it to the client.
    4. We do this so that we can track what version of the document was sent to the client. **TIP**: If you are not working with SharePoint then we recommend you follow the rule [Do you include version numbers in your file names?](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rule/RulesToBetterTechnicalDocumentation.aspx#VersionNumber)
