The lifecycle of a PBI can be broken down into 3 steps:

<!--endintro-->

### 0. Before it's ready

1. Received an email with some work to do? Get it into the backlog as a PBI ASAP (as per [Do you turn an email into a work item before starting work?](/turn-emails-into-work-items)).
2. Is the PBI ready? Check your PBI against your [Definition of Ready](/have-a-definition-of-ready).

### 1. Ready

1. Take the next PBI that was approved by the [Product Owner](/rules-to-better-product-owners)
2. Break down your PBI into tasks

### 2. Code

1. From the PBI, create a new branch (so that your work is automatically tagged to the PBI)
2. On the Kanban Board, move your Task into "In Progress"
3. Checkout your new branch and code, code, codeâ€¦ (remember to [Red, Green, Refactor](/reply-done-plus-added-a-unit-test))
4. Open a Pull Request and get another engineer in your team to do an "over the shoulder" check of the code
5. Record a Done Video so you get your ducks in a row for the explanation to the Product Owner, and so they give you earlier feedback.
6. Make changes based on feedback (and then get more feedback)
7. Are you "Done"? Check your [Definition of Done](/definition-of-done) and complete the Pull Request!

### 3. Done

This should be easiest part!

1. Close off the PBI by replying done inside the PBI and also in the email thread

Congrats, your PBI is now ready to be demonstrated during your Sprint Review!

**Note:** This is the same process you'd follow for a Bug.
