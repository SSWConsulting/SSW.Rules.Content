<span class='intro'> <p>​​​You don't want this error&#58;<br></p><p class="greyBox">&quot;120_ClientInvoice_ClientIDRequired.sql...Column 'dbo.Client.ClientID' is not of same collation as referencing column 'ClientInvoice.ClientID' in foreig...&quot;</p>When you write a stored proc - it must work regardless of the users collation. When you are joining to a temp table - meaning you are joining 2 different databases (eg. Northwind and TempDB) they won't​ always have the same collation.​<p></p><p>The reality is that you can't tell a user what collation to run their TempDB - we can only specify the collation Northwind should be (we don't even want to specify that - we want that to be their default (as per their server))​​.<br><br></p> </span>
