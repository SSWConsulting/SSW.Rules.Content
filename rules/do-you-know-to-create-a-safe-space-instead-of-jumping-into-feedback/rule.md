<span class='intro'> <p>One of the biggest mistakes people make when giving feedback is giving it when one or the other is stressed, angry, frustrated, or in a hurry – and this is one of the worst times to give feedback because people aren’t in a place to hear it and really think about it.&#160;Make sure the recipient of the feedback is in a safe space and prepared to take the feedback, rather than just rattling off everything that’s on your chest the moment you next speak to them.&#160;</p><p>​Giving feedback should be done in a safe space, so as not to seem like you are directly attacking the feedback recipient. The&#160;way you word and give&#160;feedback is important and should be considered.&#160;<br></p><p>Consider starting with the following&#58;<br></p><p class="greyBox">&quot;Hey, can I share something with you?&quot;<br></p><div><p class="greyBox">&quot;Hey, have you got time now for a retro?&quot;<br></p><p>Then start with the good…&#160;<strong>before the bad</strong>. <br></p></div> </span>

Have a calm conversation about what you observed and what could be done differently.​&quot;​​<br></p></div>
