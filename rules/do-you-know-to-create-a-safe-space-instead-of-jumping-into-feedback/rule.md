<span class='intro'> <p>Giving feedback should be done in a safe space, so as not to seem like you are directly attacking the feedback recipient. The&#160;way you word and give&#160;feedback is important and should be considered. <br><br>Consider starting with the following&#58;<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">&quot;Hey, can I share something with you?&quot;<br></p><div><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">&quot;Hey, have you got time now for a retro?&quot;<br></p><p>Then start with the good…&#160;<strong>before the bad</strong>. <br></p></div> </span>

<div><p>Brian Harry said in <a href="https&#58;//blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/bharry/2017/08/18/taking-feedback/">his blog​​</a>&#58;</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">&quot;​Don’t try to give feedback when you are angry or frustrated.&#160;Take&#160;the time to digest what you need to say – to separate your frustration from an objective assessment of what happened. Have a calm conversation about what you observed and what could be done differently.​&quot;​​<br></p></div>
