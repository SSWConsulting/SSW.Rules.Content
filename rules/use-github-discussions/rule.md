Discussions are a great place to chat with your team and brainstorm new ideas!

If you're thinking of making a Pull Request to suggest some changes to a document, code or something else. If you're not sure about your suggestions, you could leverage GitHub Discussions to see what people think!

Here's a [great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bErGYN3Ljz8) by the GitHub team that explains Discussions in full!
