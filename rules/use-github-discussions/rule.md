Discussions are a great place to chat with your team and brainstorm new ideas!

If you're thinking of making a Pull Request/Issue to suggest some changes to a document, code or something else. If you're not sure about your suggestions, you could leverage GitHub Discussions to see what people think!

Here's a [great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bErGYN3Ljz8) by the GitHub team that explains Discussions in full!

<!--endintro-->

When you're looking to make some changes, chat about the project or or otherwise engage with a project on GitHub. There are some simple steps you can take to choose the right place to engage. They are:

## Discussion to Issue

The default choice that one should make is to look for a discussion or create a discussion! If you're looking to create some new content for the repo, change some code or otherwise ask a question, discussions are a great place to start.

From there you can add your comments and let others know about it by @ mentioning them (E.g. @BobNorthwind). When you're done discussing and you have something to action on the project, you can then easily convert the discussion into an issue!

Now that it's an issue, you can of course associate Pull Requests with that issue and otherwise associate work with that rather than the whole project.

Of these three stages: Discussion, Issue and Pull Request, you can always jump in at any point. For example, if all it is that you're doing is updating a spelling error, It might be worth just opening a Pull Request.
