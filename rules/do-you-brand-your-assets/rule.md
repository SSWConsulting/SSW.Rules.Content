<p>Branding your assets is one more thing that you can do to spread your brand to the world. For example, if you provide your team with laptops, it's nice to&#160;have those&#160;laptops branded with your business logo, so they can be seen when they&#160;visit a client.</p><p>​Basically, you can have that on any asset owned by your business. Items like&#160;monitors, laptops and computers branded with a sticker with your logo&#160;are all opportunities for&#160;more&#160;branding.</p><p>For items like laptops, it can also be a good idea to&#160;tape your business card below the sticker so it can be returned to you if you lose it.​<br></p><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureNormal"><img src="/SiteAssets/brand-your-assets/MicrosoftTeams-image%20(7).png" alt="MicrosoftTeams-image (7).png" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;808px;" />Figure&#58; Sticker proving that you should take every chance to show off your brand<br></dd></dl><p></p><div class="ssw15-rteElement-ContentBlock-SSW-Only">-&#160;​​​If your laptop is owned by SSW (this also means Salary Sacrifice computers that have not been fully paid yet), make sure it has a sticker on the back with its name and image (preferred), or at least a little SSW sticker on it.<br>-&#160;​​If it doesn't have the sticker, ask for your Office admin for a sticker or send an email and ask for help to SSWSysAdmins (SSWSysAdmins@ssw.com.au).​<br></div><p><br></p>
