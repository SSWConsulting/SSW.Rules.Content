<span class='intro'> Every now and then, client will purchase training or event passes and be unable to attend. In this scenario, 2 things should occur in order&#58; </span>

<ol>
<li>They should be offered an alternative. This is important as if they needed the training, they may well appreciate being given the option. This requires a conversation with the client and the alternative options are&#58;
<ol style="list-style&#58;lower-alpha outside none;">
<li>A different date that the same course is being run.</li>
<li>A different course that interests them.</li>
<li>An equivalent dollar value of developer time to come onsite.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If they decline and ask for a refund instead, then this should be processed immediately. This is absolutely vital as delaying giving a client their money back rapidly decreases their opinion of the integrity of your company.</li>
</ol>
<div class="greyBox">
<p>At SSW, this means that the Accountant can always issue a refund for an event immediately, without any further approval needed from Adam, so long as at least 1 alternative has been verbally offered to the client (normally by the Account Manager)</p>
