When you are tuning SQL statements you tend to play in SQL management studio for a while. During this time SQL caches your query's and execution plans.

<!--endintro-->

All well and good but when you are trying to speed up an existing query that is taking some time then you may not be making a difference even though your execution times are way down.

You really need to clear SQL's cache (or buffer) every time you test the speed of a query. This prevents the data and/or execution plans from being cached, thus corrupting the next test.

To clear SQL Server's cache, run `DBCC DROPCLEANBUFFERS`, which clears all data from the cache. Then run `DBCC FREEPROCCACHE`, which clears the stored procedure cache.
