Users expect underlined text to be a hyperlink. Never underline text that isn't a link.

<!--endintro-->

![Figure: Never underline the text when it isn't a link (even        Scott Guthrie agrees!)](../../assets/Websites\_UnderlineNoHyperlink.gif)  

We have a program called  [SSW Code Auditor](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/Rules.aspx#BreadCrumbs) to check for this rule.
