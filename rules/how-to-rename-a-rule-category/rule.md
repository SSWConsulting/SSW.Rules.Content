To update a rule category name, please follow these steps:

<!--endintro-->

1. **Rename “category name" in metadata:** 
Go to [https://rules.ssw.com.au/\_layouts/15/termstoremanager.aspx?tsid=eacc332d045a40e1bcc10498d65b767f](/_layouts/15/termstoremanager.aspx?tsid=eacc332d045a40e1bcc10498d65b767f)
E.g. Search “Rules to Better Lync" to find it, double click the “term item title" to rename it to “Rules to Better Skype for Business (formerly Lync)"
