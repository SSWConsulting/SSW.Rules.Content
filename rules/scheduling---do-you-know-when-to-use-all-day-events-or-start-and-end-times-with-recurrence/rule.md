<p>
          For an appointment of one day or less, use the start and end times so that it is
          easily viewed on people's calendars as 1 day appointments are easy to miss. However,
          if the appointment spans more than one day (e.g. 2 weeks) it's ok to use 1 appointment
          to span the whole time period, as it drastically reduces the complexity of keeping
          it accurate, up to date, and showing easily on the Service Calendar.</p>
