People are often very inconsistent with how they make appointments. Sometimes they use full days and sometimes they give a start and end time. It's important to be consistent.

**For a 1 day appointment**

* Bad Example - An all day appointment is [not as visible](/appointments-do-you-send-outlook-calendar-appointments-when-appropriate) and doesn't tell the client when the developer will arrive and leave.
* Good Example - a start and end time will visibly fill his calendar and also give everyone a shared understanding of when the developer is working.




**For multiple day appointments**

CRM supports recurring appointments, and this allows for more flexibility in bookings, so you should always use these over using one long appointment for a booking.

This also works better for Service Calendar syncing, as you can see what each person is working on each day.

**For Leave**

Leave appointments are the one time when it's actually useful to have the appointment out of the way up the top in your calendar, so "All Day" appointments are better for this.
