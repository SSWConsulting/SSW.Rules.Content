<span class='intro'> <p>​People are often very inconsistent with&#160;how they make appointments. Sometimes they use full days and sometimes they give a start and end time. It's important to be consistent.</p><p><strong>​For a 1 day appointment</strong><br></p><ul><li><span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">Bad Example - An all day appointment is <a href="/appointments-do-you-send-outlook-calendar-appointments-when-appropriate">not as visible</a>​​ and doesn't tell the client when the developer will arrive and leave.&#160;</span></li><li><span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">Good Example -&#160;a start and end time will <span style="line-height&#58;20.7999992370605px;">visibly&#160;</span><span style="line-height&#58;20.7999992370605px;">fill his calendar and also&#160;</span>give everyone a shared understanding of when the developer is working.</span><br></li></ul><p></p><p><strong>For multiple day appointments</strong></p><p>CRM supports recurring appointments, and this allows for more flexibility in bookings, so you should always use these over using one long appointment for a booking.</p> </span>

<p>This also works better for Service Calendar syncing, as you can see what each person is working on each day.</p><dl class="badImage"><dt>
