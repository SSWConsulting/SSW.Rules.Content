<p>​People are often very inconsistent with how they make appointments. Sometimes they use full days and sometimes they give a start and end time. It's important to be consistent.</p><p><strong>​For a 1 day appointment</strong><br></p><ul><li><span style="line-height:1.6;">Bad Example - An all day appointment is <a href="/appointments-do-you-send-outlook-calendar-appointments-when-appropriate">not as visible</a>​​ and doesn't tell the client when the developer will arrive and leave. </span></li><li><span style="line-height:1.6;">Good Example - a start and end time will <span style="line-height:20.7999992370605px;">visibly </span><span style="line-height:20.7999992370605px;">fill his calendar and also </span>give everyone a shared understanding of when the developer is working.</span><br></li></ul><p></p><p><strong>For multiple day appointments</strong></p><p>CRM supports recurring appointments, and this allows for more flexibility in bookings, so you should always use these over using one long appointment for a booking.</p>

<p>This also works better for Service Calendar syncing, as you can see what each person is working on each day.</p><dl class="badImage"><dt>
