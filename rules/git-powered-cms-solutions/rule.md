Developers love Git üòç, and while it was originally built as a version control system for source code, it's now used to power all kinds of awesome tools - including Content Management Systems (CMS)! So how is a Git-powered CMS different to a traditional CMS platform, and why would you want to use one?

<!--endintro-->

## Difference between traditional and Git-based CMS platforms

When traditional content management systems (CMS) were designed to cater to the needs of marketers, they prioritized ease of use but often lacked the flexibility crucial for developers. Modern developers, accustomed to continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) processes inspired by DevOps principles, thrive on workflows that enhance productivity.

Most traditional CMS platforms rely on centralized databases and content storage services that not only impose limitations but also prescribe the overall capabilities of the content repository and the CMS. Conversely, a Git-based CMS offers version control for both content and configuration together - meaning you have much greater flexibility (and speedier development!) when compared with a traditional CMS.
