There are two common types of application architecture:

- Monoliths (aka N-Tier applications)
- Microservices

Monoliths have their place. They are easy to get going and often make a lot of sense when you are starting out. However, sometimes your app may grow in size and become difficult to maintain. Then you might want to consider Microservices...

<!--endintro-->

Microservices let you break down your app into little pieces to make them more manageable, replaceable and maintainable. You can also scale out different parts of your app at a granular level.

.NET 6 and Azure have heaps of great tools for developing simple APIs and worker services in a Microservices pattern.

## The tools of the trade

- [.NET Worker Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/workers) make it easier to implement dependency injection, configuration and other syntactic sugar using the same patterns you are familiar with in other types of .NET applications

- [Azure Container Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-apps/#overview) give you a way to host different little subsections of the application

- [Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/) gives you a great way to build applications in small, modular, scalable and easy to manage chunks. It provides triggers other than http to handle other common microservice patterns

- [Minimal APIs](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-net-6-preview-4/#introducing-minimal-apis) give you a way to write APIs in just a few short lines of code

## What's the point?

- Cost - Provides separation of scalability, keep the hot parts of your app hot and the cold parts of your app cold to achieve maximum pricing efficiency
- Maintainability - Keep code more manageable by making it bite sized chunks
- Simplify code - Write minimal APIs
- Deployment - Standardize deployment with containers
- Testing - Easier to find problems since they are isolated to a specific part of the app
- Cognitive Complexity - Devs can focus on one aspect of the app at a time
- Data - You can use the best way of storing data for each service
- Language - You can use the best language for each service

## What's the downside?

- Upfront Cost - More upfront work is required
- Cognitive Complexity - While individual apps are simpler, the architecture of the app can become more complex
- Health Check - It's harder to know if all parts are alive
- Domain boundaries - You need to define the separation of concerns between different services. Avoid adding dependencies between services because you can create a domino of failures...a house of cards.
- Performance normally suffers as calls are made between services
- Without adequate testing it's harder to maintain
- Using multiple languages and datastores can be both more expensive to host and require more developers

## What new techniques are required

- Contract Testing - To mitigate the risk of changes in one service breaking another, comprehensive tests that check the behaviour of services is required
