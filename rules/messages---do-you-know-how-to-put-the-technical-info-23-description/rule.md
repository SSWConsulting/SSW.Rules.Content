<span class='intro'> <h4>Description</h4>
<div>The description should explain <em>what the error was</em>, followed by the <em>why it occurred</em>. Information that is useful for debugging should be included with errors where possible in a &quot;Details&quot; section. You should also avoid making the text unnecessarily wide. e.g.</div> </span>

â€‹<dl class="badImage"><dt><img alt="Centrix - Invalid Quote" src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/BadMessageBox.gif" /></dt>
<dd>Figure&#58; Bad Example - A message box that does not intuitively alert the user</dd></dl>
<ul><li>This is confusing, because it uses different terminology to the title (&quot;estimate&quot; instead of &quot;quote&quot;)</li>
<li>There is no punctuation</li>
<li>The word &quot;Error&quot; is meaningless</li>
<li>Line breaks are not present, so the message box is too wide and the text may wrap in the wrong spot</li></ul>
<dl class="goodImage"><dt><img alt="Centrix - Invalid Quote Details" src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/GoodMessageBox.gif" /></dt>
<dd>Figure&#58; Good Example - A message box that is clear, consistent and intuitive</dd></dl>
<ul><li>Terminology is consistent</li>
<li>Punctuation is present</li>
<li>&quot;Details&quot; indicates that this information is useful for debugging</li>
<li>The text is split across three lines, and the technical information after Details is separated from the description of the error</li></ul>
