<span class='intro'> <p>Just like a car, applications need servicing and tuning every now and then to stay in top condition. They might need alterations to deal with new business problems, or just tuning to increase efficiency.

<p>So you’ve done 10 good sprints and the <a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=e01abde1-9a3e-4e4c-84a8-50e98e9c44d0">software has been delivered ​(ready) </a> and the team is winding down. It will need maintenance.<br></p><p>Different clients need different levels of support. Offer your clients a few different support offerings.</p><ol><li>Ongoing Maintenance&#58; 1 day per week (or whatever quantity suits), a developer will work on enhancements and bug fixing. This is useful because the client always knows when work will next be done.</li><li>Maintenance Contract&#58; For 10% per year of the cost of the system you developed, all bugs will be fixed. This way your client will be guaranteed that the system will keep on running.</li><li>Time and Materials or Prepaid&#58; A client can simply call for bug fixing or support as and when needed. However, unless it's a show stopper, this model can involve waiting for developer availability.</li><li>Fixed Price Warranty&#58; For a fixed price project, a warranty commences after the Sprint Review. The warranty length is half the length of the sprint and, during this period, any bugs reported will be fixed for free.<br></li></ol><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Warranty on a Fixed Price Contract</h3><p>Once the sprint review is complete, the Product Owner has half the sprint period again to report any bugs.</p><p> 
   <strong>Note&#58;</strong> The warranty period pauses when the client reports a bug that stops them testing further. The warranty period resumes when a new version is sent. For example, the client may report a bug on a Wednesday morning on &quot;Day 4&quot; of the warranty. The bug is fixed on Friday and a new version is sent late in the afternoon. The warranty period resumes on Monday morning, at &quot;Day 4&quot;. Therefore Wednesday through Friday was not included in the warranty.</p><p> 
   <strong>Note&#58;</strong> There is no warranty on a time &amp; materials contract.</p><div class="greyBox"> 
   <strong>Important&#58;&#160; </strong>During the warranty period, all feedback from clients should be moved to backlog unless they fall into the <a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=117f6f22-8c72-4895-b419-1e2e0dc5fbf1"> bug definition</a>. <br></div>
