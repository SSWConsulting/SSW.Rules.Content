![](expense-reimbursement.png)
You should be reimbursed for all reasonable expenses incurred in carrying out your duties, which are above your normal costs, to and from the office.

A common example is bus and train fares to client sites. In Australia, amounts under $100 could be reimbursed through Petty Cash but in China, it would be around ï¿¥300.

Remember to treat your company's money like your own and minimize costs where possible. Try to search around for a better price before committing to a purchase.

All expense claims must:

* Be work-related
* Be made within a week
* Be signed by the claimant and authorized by the relevant Manager
* Be supported by Tax Invoices
* Not include alcohol, as it incurs FBT
* Receipts should be in English (where possible), or you must write on the receipt what the expense is, and what it was for
