Creating a responsive website? It's important to make sure the browser renders your content correctly on any screen size. Define the proper viewport meta tag to inform web browsers they need to behave responsively.

<!--endintro-->

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
```

Your website's viewport should be the same width as any given device's screen. Specify this with the content attribute `_device-width_`.

### Resize Text

The viewport meta tag should **not** set `_user-scaling=no_` or a `_maximum-scaling_` value less than 2. This allows us to meet accessibility standards for scalable content. [See WCAG 1.4.4](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/resize-text.html).
