Having     an electronic task board makes it easy for developers to keep track of tasks.

These are the columns (aka swim lanes) you need:

<dl class="goodImage">&lt;dt&gt;<img src="TFS Preview Task Board.png" alt="TFS Preview Task Board.png" style="width:550px;">&lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: Good Example - a virtual client task board in action (<a href="http://tfspreview.com/">TFS</a>)</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage">&lt;dt&gt;
      <img src="Taskboard.jpg" alt="TaskBoard" style="width:550px;">
   &lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: OK Example - a physical client task board in operation</dd></dl>
Near your task board, stick an SSW "Want to submit a User Story?"

* Where to find their project portal
* Who to contact with questions
* How to add tasks to the task board


Print out this PDF and fill in the 2 fields and stick it on own task board.
