<span class='intro'> This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field). </span>

<p>I guess there could be special folders for bug reports that are sent by exception handlers, but I still would not be keen on this.</p>
<p>A better way is Conversation View and collapsing them if you need to hide them.&#160;</p>
<dl class="image">
<dt><img style="border-right&#58;0px solid;border-top&#58;0px solid;border-left&#58;0px solid;border-bottom&#58;0px solid;" alt="Conversation View" src="/Standards/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/PublishingImages/conversationview.JPG" border="0" /> 
<dd>Figure&#58; Conversation View allows you to choose which folders to collapse.</dd></dl>
