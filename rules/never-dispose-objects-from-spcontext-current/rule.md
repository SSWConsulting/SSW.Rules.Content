Disposing objects in SharePoint is important, but never do it with objects from `SPContext.Current`. SharePoint will manage disposing these objects itself.

```csharp
using (SPWeb web =  SPContext.Current.Site.RootWeb)
{
    //do something here
}
```

::: bad
Figure: Using statement is trying to dispose current site object - it will cause exception  
:::

Just simply use "Current" object directly.

```csharp
SPWeb web =Â  SPContext.Current.Site.RootWeb;
//do something here
```

::: good
Figure: Use Current objects directly - don't need to dispose them
