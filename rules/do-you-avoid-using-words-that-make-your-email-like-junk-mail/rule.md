<span class='intro'> Outlook by default reads your emails and can flag your email as potential junk email, or adult content email by examining a list of Sensitive words. This list is not available to the public.<br>
 </span>


  <p>You should avoid&#160;any&#160;swear words or be using an angry tone as well.</p>
<p class="ssw15-rteElement-YellowBorderBox">We have a program called <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/LookOut/">SSW LookOut! for Outlook</a> to check for this rule. <br>
<img class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" alt="Contact or bad word" src="ContactorBadWord.GIF" /> <br>
Figure&#58; SSW LookOut! for Outlook checks that you don't use bad words.​​<br></p>
