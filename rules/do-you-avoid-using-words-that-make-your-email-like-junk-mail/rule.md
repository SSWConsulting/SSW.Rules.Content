Outlook by default reads your emails and can flag your email as potential junk email, or adult content email by examining a list of Sensitive words. This list is not available to the public.

<!--endintro-->

You should avoid any swear words or be using an angry tone as well.

We have a program called [SSW LookOut! for Outlook](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/LookOut/) to check for this rule.

 Figure: SSW LookOut! for Outlook checks that you don't use bad words.
