TikTok is a great way to engage with your audience via social media. TikTok is a more fun, informal, and relaxed social media platform compared to the likes of YouTube, Facebook, LinkedIn etc. It allows for a different style of creative freedom and spontaneity in your videos. 

However, to truly engage effectively with your audience, it is important to format and edit your videos with some rules and best practices that are optimised for TikTok.  Doing this will ensure your videos are seen exactly how you intended them to be seen.

## TikTok video length

TikTok videos can be anywhere as short as 2 seconds to a maximum of 10 minutes.  The most effective TikTok videos range from 15 seconds to 3 mins. Here are some of the most-watched TikTok videos of all time:

 

1. Zach King's Harry Potter illusion - 2.2 billion views - <https://www.tiktok.com/@zachking/video/6768504823336815877?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc>
2. James Charles' Christmas wonderland transition - 1.7 billion views - <https://www.tiktok.com/@jamescharles/video/6768188988441332998?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc>

4. Boss reacts to case in the box - <https://www.tiktok.com/@tofutech/video/7082371662452165889?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc>

While creators are able to make longer video the optimum length would appear to be shorter.
