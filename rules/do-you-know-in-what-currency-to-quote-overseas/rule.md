The easy thing is to just quote the price in your local currency. Go the extra step and convert it to a currency they understand.

If you are not sure what currency to use, just use US Dollars, which is the international currency.



<!--endintro-->

Of course, if you are dealing with somebody regularly, then you should know their preferred currency.

E.g. Chinese company billing someone in Brazil:
<dl class="bad">&lt;dt&gt;Our price is CNY 1,000&lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure&#58; Bad example - the client will need to convert it</dd></dl><dl class="good">&lt;dt&gt;Our price is CNY 1,000 (about USD $160)&lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure&#58; Good example - USD gives a clear understanding of the costs</dd></dl>
