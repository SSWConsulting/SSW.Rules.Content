When users are deleting a lot of records as part of normal operations - they can and do make mistakes. Instead of the painful process of having to go to a backup to get these records, why not simply flag the records as IsDeleted?

Advantages

:::

* You do not have to delete all related records e.g. Customers, Orders, Order Details. Instead, you can just flag the parent record as deleted with an "IsDeleted" bit field.
* You do not lose historical data e.g. how many products one of your previous clients purchased.
* You can actually see who deleted the record, as your standard audit columns (e.g. DateUpdated, UserUpdated are still there. The record does not just vanish.
* It is simple to implement - particularly when using a code generator. For example - our code generator produces views and stored procedures, and all data access layer code. With all data access done through the data layer views, we simply had to add a filter to all views ("WHERE IsDeleted = 0"). Our autogenerated delete stored procedures simply set the "IsDeleted" column to false.

Disadvantages

:::

* Depending on your interface design, you may have to join to parent tables to ensure that deleted child records do not appear. Typically, the interface would be designed in such a way that you would not need be able to created new records based on the deleted items (e.g. you cannot create a new order record for a customer that is deleted). Performance of queries can potentially suffer if you have to do these joins.
* While storage space is very cheap, you are not removing records from your database. You may need to archive records if the number of deleted records becomes large.
