<span class='intro'> 
  <p>Snapshots are a very easy way to back up a system before a big change is made. They can also be easily restored if something goes wrong during the change.<br></p>
 </span>


  <ol>
    
    <li>In the <strong>Hyper-V Manager</strong>, ensure the Virtual Machine has the state of <strong>Off</strong></li>
    <li>Right click on the virtual machine you wish to snapshot and click <strong>Snapshot</strong></li>
    <li>The snapshot should run very quickly and you will notice the snapshot in the <strong>Snapshots </strong>area of the <strong>Hyper-V Manager<br>
    <br>
    <img alt="You will see the snapshots associated with a Virtual Machine when you click on them" src="snapshot-while-off.jpg" /></strong></li>
    <font class="ms-rteCustom-FigureGood" size="+0"><strong>You will see the snapshots associated with a Virtual Machine when you click on them</strong></font>
    
</ol>
