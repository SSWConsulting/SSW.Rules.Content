Users should be able to navigate around your application without having to return to the main menu to open a related form.

Think about a summary report - users should always be able to "drill-down" to track a transaction to its original source.
                    Think about a data entry form - users should always be able to "drill-down" to the look up table

There are four ways to provide drill-downs:

1. Preferred - Use buttons to navigate around the application

2. Double click the control
3. Use buttons with three dots - an ellipsis (...) character

4. Use hyperlinks

Another handy thing to add for users is "drill-around". This is implemented by using a right mouse-click to activate context-sensitive links between related screens.
