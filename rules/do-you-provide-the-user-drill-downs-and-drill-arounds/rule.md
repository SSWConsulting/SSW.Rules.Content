<span class='intro'> <p>Users should be able to navigate around your application without having to return to the main menu to open a related form.</p><p>Think about a summary report - users should always be able to &quot;drill-down&quot; to track a transaction to its original source.<br>
                   Think about a data entry form - users should always be able to &quot;drill-down&quot; to the look up table</p> </span>

<p>There are four ways to provide drill-downs&#58;</p><ol><li>Preferred - Use buttons to navigate around the application

         </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Use named buttons to navigate around the application (Preferred)</dd></dl></li><li>Double click the control</li><li>Use buttons with three dots - an ellipsis (...) character

         </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good Example - Use ellipses to navigate around the application</dd></dl></li><li>Use hyperlinks

         </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Drill-downs implemented as links (an interesting alternative but a bit too much of a visual impact)</dd></dl></li></ol><p>Another handy thing to add for users is &quot;drill-around&quot;. This is implemented by using a right mouse-click to activate context-sensitive links between related screens.</p>
