Users should be able to navigate around your application without having to return to the main menu to open a related form.

Think about a summary report - users should always be able to "drill-down" to track a transaction to its original source.
                    Think about a data entry form - users should always be able to "drill-down" to the look up table

<!--endintro-->

There are four ways to provide drill-downs:

1. Preferred - Use buttons to navigate around the application <br>      <dl class="image">&lt;dt&gt;
            <img alt="SSW Timesheets - Add Timesheet Entry" src="../../assets/DrillDownDrillAround.gif" style="margin:5px;">
         &lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: Use named buttons to navigate around the application (Preferred)</dd></dl>
2. Double click the control
3. Use buttons with three dots - an ellipsis (...) character <br>      <dl class="goodImage">&lt;dt&gt;
            <img alt="SSW Code Auditor - Path to Scan" src="../../assets/CodeAuditorEllipses.gif" style="margin:5px;">
         &lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: Good Example - Use ellipses to navigate around the application</dd></dl>
4. Use hyperlinks <br>      <dl class="image">&lt;dt&gt;
            <img alt="Asset Form" src="../../assets/AssetForm.png" style="margin:5px;">
         &lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: Drill-downs implemented as links (an interesting alternative but a bit too much of a visual impact)</dd></dl>


Another handy thing to add for users is "drill-around". This is implemented by using a right mouse-click to activate context-sensitive links between related screens.
