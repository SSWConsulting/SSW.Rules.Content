<p>Users should be able to navigate around your application without having to return to the main menu to open a related form.</p><p>Think about a summary report - users should always be able to &quot;drill-down&quot; to track a transaction to its original source.<br>
                   Think about a data entry form - users should always be able to &quot;drill-down&quot; to the look up table</p>

<p>There are four ways to provide drill-downs&#58;</p><ol><li>Preferred - Use buttons to navigate around the application

This is implemented by using a right mouse-click to activate context-sensitive links between related screens.</p>
