It's best to conduct an internal and external test procedure for videos. This ensures that you meet your internal standards and follow the necessary rules that relate to video content creation.

You can also identify errors and inconsistencies that can be addressed for a second edit, before going live.

<!--endintro-->

1. Complete the video editing (Version 1)
   Produce your first edit of your video. Follow videos' post-production rules i.e. ['Do you use cutaways?'](/production-post-production-do-you-use-cutaways-aka-removing-the-talking-head), ['Do you add a Call to Action?'](/production-do-you-add-a-call-to-action)
2. Upload your first edit to YouTube
3. Send 'Test Please' to your **manager(s)** as per [Do you know how to request a "Test Please"?](/request-a-test-please)
   * Feedback must be done within 48 hours
   * If response isn’t submitted within designated time, the process moves to the next step

   **Note:** To move ahead, you need two out of the three "test pass"

4. Make changes to video from feedback
5. Re-upload to YouTube
6. Respond to each feedback with "Dones" and reasons for "Not Dones"
  
7. Send test please to your **managers**, any **people on the video** and **one of the test groups**
   * 48 hours to test
   * 6 people on the test
   * Need 3 responses to move ahead
   * If response isn’t submitted within designated time, the process moves to the next step
8. Make changes to video from feedback
9. Respond to each feedback with "Dones" and reasons for "Not Dones"
10. Send final test please – not for major changes (spelling mistakes, glaring faults etc.)
    * If there is no response within 48 hours, we go live

**Tip:** (Optional) Create a post for the new video on your website (e.g. tv.ssw.com), embedding the YouTube upload.
