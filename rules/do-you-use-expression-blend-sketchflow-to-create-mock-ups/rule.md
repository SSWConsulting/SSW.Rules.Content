Mock-ups are very powerful tools to communicate requirements with clients, however it could be very time consuming and costing to create a good looking mock-up. Also, we don't want to "create and throw" our mock-ups, they should be picked up by developers and add features on top of them once the client approves the work. 

 Using Expression + SketchFlow, you can:

* Quickly create sketch-style mock-ups with little efforts,
* Share your mock-ups with the whole team and clients easily,
* Collect feedbacks from clients,
* Use them in development process directly (as they are real Sliverlight and WPF solution files)
