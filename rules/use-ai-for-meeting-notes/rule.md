Manually typing out meeting notes is slow, error-prone, and distracting. While youâ€™re typing, youâ€™re likely missing parts of the discussion and contributing less. Worse, you might spend time afterward cleaning up notes instead of acting on them. 

In fact, employees estimate that [37% of their biggest cost is wasted time in meetings](https://joingenius.com/statistics/meeting-statistics/), and context-switching after interruptions takes an average of [9 minutes to recover from](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/context-switching). **Manual notetaking multiplies both problems.**

## Why manual notes fall short

* **Hard to Keep Up:** Typing during fast talks makes it hard to understand everything
* **Lose Your Focus:** Note-takers miss things or can't join the discussion
* **Tiring Your Brain:** Switching between listening and typing is hard work
* **More Work Later:** You still have to fix up, sort, and send the notes

## Why AI note-takers are better

AI transcription tools like **[Read AI](https://www.read.ai/)**, **Otter.ai**, and **Fireflies.ai** handle notetaking for you, with:

* **Speed** â€“ Get transcripts and summaries within seconds of the meeting ending
* **Accuracy** â€“ Capture every word, no typos or forgotten context
* **Talk-time metrics** â€“ See how much each participant contributed
* **Automated follow-up** â€“ Receive email summaries with action items and highlights
