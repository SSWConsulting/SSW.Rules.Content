There are times you should have your email checked by someone else before sending.
Simply ask for that person to come over and check it on your computer or IM them if the person is not close by (e.g. in a different room).
This way you are guaranteed instant feedback and you won't clog up someone else's inbox with unnecessary emails.

<!--endintro-->

Examples are:

* Where you are a little unsure
* When you are new to a company and sending an email to a large distribution list
* Sending a complicated email
* Sending a sensitive email (where the content could be perceived as confrontational)
* In application development, when you need a quick '[test please](/conduct-a-test-please)', and the person is immediately available. This provides you a chance to check and collaborate on the finished change before the '[done email](/dones-do-you-reply-done-and-delete-the-original-email)' is sent. It also shows the email was double-checked. 

Doing this will ensure:

* You avoid grammatical and spelling errors
* The layout and tone of the email is professional
* You havenâ€™t forgotten anything important
* The receiver knows who else agrees with the content

### Web content - Check grammar and links

When you action a task for adding or making big changes to **web content** (such as a rule or suggestion), you should first paste the content into a new Word file and run the "Grammar & Spelling Check".
Once you confirm there are no errors, you may add the content to the site. 

After that, run [SSW LinkAuditor](https://sswlinkauditor.com/) in order to keep 0 bad links on that page.
