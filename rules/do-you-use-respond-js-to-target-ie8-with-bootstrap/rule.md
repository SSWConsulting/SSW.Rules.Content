​<span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">&#160;</span><p>Include Respond JS in your application, after Bootstrap. Respond JS enables responsive web designs in browsers which don't support CSS3 Media Queries.</p><p>&#160;</p><img src="file&#58;///C&#58;/Users/DREWRO~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image001.png" alt="" style="width&#58;450px;margin&#58;5px;" /><p><strong>Figure&#58; Include respond.js in your bootstrap bundle</strong></p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong><em>Note</em></strong><em>&#58; Respond JS will be included in a new MVC5 Web Application.
