<span class='intro'>   <br>
If you use Exchange Server, Auto-Archive moves the archived items from the Exchange Server to a local drive on your notebook or desktop. While this keeps your Exchange Server nice and small, if you happen to use email&#160;to store&#160;legal documents, or want to search for emails you've sent a year ago, Auto-Archive is like throwing data away.
