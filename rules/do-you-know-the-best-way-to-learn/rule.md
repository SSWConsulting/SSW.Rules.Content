<span class='intro'> <p>Learning a new technology is something a developer&#160;has to do&#160;<span style="line-height&#58;20.8px;">&#160;at least</span> &#160;every few years. The industry landscape is constantly changing and to keep up and the developer has to really master the art of learning.</p><p>Over the years, SSW has trained thousands of developers and&#160;we have found that the best way to learn is through mentorship. <a href="http&#58;//adamcogan.com/2016/06/06/train-devs-quickly/" target="_blank">Mentorship​</a>&#160;​is when an experienced developer t<span></span><span></span>eaches and codes with their mentee. By working closely together on a regular basis they are able to impart their knowledge and experience&#160;into the mentee.</p><p>Of course, there are other ways of learning and the chart below discusses the effectiveness of each.​​</p><img src="/PublishingImages/learn-rate.png" alt="learn-rate.png" style="margin&#58;0px;width&#58;800px;height&#58;590px;" /><br> </span>
