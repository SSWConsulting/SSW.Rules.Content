Each font or style (italics or bold) should be used consistently throughout your presentation. While a different font face or color is a simple way of highlighting certain terms you want for focus, too much of it will do exactly the opposite and distract the audience.

<!--endintro-->

* Use one font and its variations in a presentation
  * Steer clear of excessively bright colors or any flourished type face (both are hard to read)
* Keep the styles (eg. bold or color) consistent between slides, so it's easy to identify the hierarchy
