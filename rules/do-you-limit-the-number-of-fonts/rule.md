Each font or style (italics or bold) should be used consistently throughout your presentation. While a different font face or color is a simple way of highlighting certain terms you want for focus, too much of it will do exactly the opposite and distract the audience.

The rules are:

* Use one font per presentation
* Use one style (eg. bold or color) per slide if possible
* Steer clear of excessively bright colors or any flourished type face (both are hard to read)
