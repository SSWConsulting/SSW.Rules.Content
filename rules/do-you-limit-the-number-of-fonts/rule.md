<span class='intro'> 
  <p>Each font or style (italics or bold) should be used consistently throughout your presentation. While a different font face or color is a simple way of highlighting certain terms you want for focus, too much of it will do exactly the opposite and distract the audience.</p>
<p>The rules are&#58;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use one font per presentation </li>
    <li>Use one style (eg. bold or color) per slide if possible </li>
    <li>Steer clear of excessively bright colors or any flourished type face (both are hard to read) </li>
</ul>
 </span>
