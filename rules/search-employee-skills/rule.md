AD has all your users e.g. Bob, Mary, Jane...  

SharePoint also has all your users, plus you can extend this information using the [UserProfile Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/manage-user-profiles). 

The beauty of this is that if everyone has updated their skills, it is wonderfully searchable.

SharePoint has an Admin UI to manage User Profiles.

[Delve](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/what-is-delve-1315665a-c6af-4409-a28d-49f8916878ca) is a cool product with a nice UI that is essentially a portal onto the User Profiles.

Where it all falls down...

What if your people‚Äôs skills are stored in another system such as Dynamics 365 CRM or Salesforce?

![Figure: People‚Äôs skills are often stored in Dynamics 365 CRM or Salesforce](extending-ad-4.png)

You can use PowerShell and SharePoint PNP libraries to programmatically interact with the SharePoint UserProfile service. This process allows you to sync skills across systems with a custom solution:

OpenSearch is another solution, using the OpenSearch protocol you can [add external data sources to your SharePoint search results](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/search/understanding-result-sources-for-search).

#### Suggestions to Microsoft:

**#1 Help me better sync my Dynamics 365 CRM data with the SharePoint user profile service**

This should be a simple SharePoint connector so this piece of PowerShell glue is not required üëå\
E.g. CRM user skills to User Profile properties

**#2 Help me make Dynamics 365 CRM data searchable from SharePoint search**

If not using a connector, we should be able to easily index and search through Dynamics 365 CRM data.
This is essentially just calling a different API.

**#3 Help me customise SharePoint search results**

If you don‚Äôt want either of those options (i.e. you users‚Äô skills are stored somewhere else), we should be able to change the search results UI.\
E.g. Search for people here: https://ssw.com.au/people

![Figure: The SharePoint Search should let you add links like in this image](sharepointuxforpeopleandbookedindays.png)

**[\#4 Help me search for user entities in Dynamics 365 CRM](https://experience.dynamics.com/ideas/idea/?ideaid=b5daa141-90f5-eb11-ba5e-0003ff457d0a)**

There should be a global user search that goes across all entities in Dynamics 365 CRM.

![Figure: Searching User + Skill doesn‚Äôt yield any result although this skill is associated to the user](extending-ad-7.png)
