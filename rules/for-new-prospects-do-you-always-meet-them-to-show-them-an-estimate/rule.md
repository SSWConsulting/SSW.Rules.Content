At the end of a Spec Review, when you've finally finished all your documentation, it can be temping to chuck it in an email to the client and call it a day... but you need to remember that you're now at the most important part of the process... and this is the key part to make sure you get right!

The findings of the Spec Review (architecture and estimates) should always be presented at a meeting (or a Teams meeting) with the key decision makers of the project for review and acceptance, generally in the form of a PowerPoint presentation, or a Word doc. It is important that all the required people are in a room together to review the findings.
