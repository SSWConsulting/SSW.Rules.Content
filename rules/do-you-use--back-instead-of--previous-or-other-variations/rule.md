<span class='intro'> According to <a target="_blank" class="external" href="http&#58;//msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms997609.aspx" shape="rect">http&#58;//msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms997609.aspx</a>, the commands for navigating through a wizard should be &quot;&lt; Back&quot; and &quot;Next &gt;&quot;. 
 </span>

  <span>&#160;
<p>When your site needs a link to iterate backwards through records we recommend that you use &quot;&lt; Back&quot; instead of &quot;&lt; Previous&quot;. </p>
<p>There are a few reasons for this&#58;</p>
<ol>
    <li>This is the standard used in Microsoft Installation files. MSIs are the most widely used installation package available today. </li>
    <li>Internet Explorer and several other lesser known browsers use a Back button to iterate back through webpages, so your visitors will automatically know what your &quot;&lt; Back&quot; link does. </li>
    <li>It is important to keep a consistency on your pages. </li>
</ol>
<p>Below is an example of a Good&#160;&quot;&lt; Back&quot; link versus some Bad variations.</p>

    <dd>Figure&#58; A Good example of a &quot;&lt; Back&quot; link </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="badImage">
    <dt><img width="226" height="41" src="/PublishingImages/badpreviouslink.gif" alt="Bad" /> </dt>
    <dd>Figure&#58; This is Bad because it says &quot;Previous&quot; instead of &quot;Back&quot; </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="goodImage">
    <dt><img width="154" height="40" src="/PublishingImages/badbacklink.gif" alt="Good" /> </dt>
    <dd>Figure&#58; This is bad because it has too many &quot;&lt;&quot;s or it has no space between the &quot;&lt;&quot; and the &quot;Back&quot; </dd>
