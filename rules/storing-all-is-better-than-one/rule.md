When developers are working on a project, they often use multiple technologies. However, in their project tracking system it might only allow them to assign one technology to a project. This functionality is problematic because it makes us lose visibility of other technologies used on the project. As such, it is best practice to always allow multiple technologies to be assigned to a project.
