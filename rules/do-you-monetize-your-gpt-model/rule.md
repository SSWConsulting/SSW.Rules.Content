The advent of GPT and LLMs have sent many industries for a loop. If you're sitting on a potential game-changer of an idea, what's the quickest way you can get that idea out to market?

<!--endintro-->

## What makes a good custom GPT?

The standard LLM in the default ChatGPT model is pretty good at a lot of things, but there are some limitations.
When you are considering a custom GPT model, you should look at 3 main features or areas where your custom model can outshine the existing ChatGPT model:

### Retrieval Augmented Reality (RAG)

In essence, RAG is the term used to describe additional data your model can access that other models have not (or cannot). Perhaps this is the IP of your company, or simply more up-to-date information on a given topic. If your model has a richer or more refined data set than the competition, it can perform better.

### Prompt template

GPT responses are only as good as the prompts they're being provided. If you're a prompt wizard, you may be able to get better responses than others. Build your magical prompts into your custom GPT, and watch people flock to your model!

### Custom actions

A huge area for innovation is being able to connect your GPT model to your own API, allowing you to take both the user input and perform additional logic before returning a response to the user. Some examples are executing code to test its validity, or looking up a weather forecast for the user's location before suggesting activities that day.

## GPT Stores

Stores such as the [OpenAI GPT Store](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-the-gpt-store) and [Bind AI](https://www.getbind.co/?ref=producthunt) let you quickly launch a custom GPT model and make it available (and monetizable) to the world.

‚úÖ **Pros**

* Fast way to get your custom GPT model live
* Easily test your model's popularity and iterate on market feedback
* Minimal/no infrastructure or maintenance concerns

‚ùå **Cons**

* May be difficult to differentiate your model from everybody else's
* Revenue-sharing model may be disadvantageous

## Bespoke product/service

Building a custom product or service for your million dollar idea is great if you have the time, energy, and know-how. It can help springboard your startup into the next market unicorn, but requires a much larger time (and dollar) commitment.

‚úÖ **Pros**

* Complete control over your product (UI, behaviour, pricing, etc.)
* Increased branding and marketability options
* Can become your MVP PaaS/SaaS offering at V1

‚ùå **Cons**

* Reliant on SEO to be discovered
* Product $$$ - typically much more expensive to get a V1 out the door
* Infrastructure $$$ - you pay for hosting and maintenance

## Investors or Venture Capitalists (VCs)

Another time-honoured tradition is convincing a VC or investment group that your idea is viable. This can often provide the runway needed to create your own bespoke offering, but does come with its own caveats.

‚úÖ **Pros**

* Can provide the funding to fully realise your vision
* Opens doors to resources/contacts that might otherwise be unavailable
* AI: so hot right now

‚ùå **Cons**

* Investors can exert pressure on the product's direction
* You lose a portion of ownership
* Competition for AI investment is fierce

## Takeaways

AI is truly a disruptive technology. There will be many industries that rise and fall on the back of ideas like yours. Use this exciting time to be innovative and creative! Then be sure to come back and give this rule a thumbs up üôÇ
