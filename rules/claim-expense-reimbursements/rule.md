It is recommended to use an appropriate system to complete expense reimbursements or digital filing of receipts. These systems will save you time and money as compared to the old method of providing paper receipts or sending countless emails. It also eliminates the problem of receiving receipts across multiple offices.

There are many systems available for employees to use to complete an expense reimbursement (check-out SSW Rules [Do you use the best mobile app for expenses?](/do-you-use-the-best-mobile-app-for-expenses) for a comparison of some of these systems). The value provided by each system is different for every business. There are several factors to consider when choosing the right system:

* Frequency which a reimbursement is made (daily, weekly, monthly etc.)
* Number of employees approved to request expense reimbursements
* Value of expenses allowed to be reimbursed (minor, major or any values)
* Subscription cost of system
* Integration capabilities with Accounting Software

It is recommended to use the Xero Expense app in tandem with the Xero Accounting software because this combination makes it simple to perform reimbursements and has a high level of customer satisfaction.

### Steps to completing an expense reimbursement

#### Employees

1. Open the Xero Expense mobile app and submit a photo of the receipt for reimbursement or filing. For digitally emailed receipts, you can either take a photo of the email and upload it as per usual or you can upload the PDF version of it within the app.

2. Either allow the app to analyse the details manually or enter the details yourself (if you are strapped for time, you can take a photo and come back to it or hold on to the receipt and attend to it when possible)
