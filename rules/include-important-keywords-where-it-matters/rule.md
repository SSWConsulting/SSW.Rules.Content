As a general rule, you should try to get all the great keywords in the title, headings and first few paragraphs of your content.

Our  **Rules to Better Google Rankings**  can be taken as an example . We thought about some keywords people would use if looking for some Google tips and tricks on how to increase your rankings. The words used for the URL were also chosen with Search Engine Optimization in mind. Here are a few more of my keywords we expect to be relevant in searches:

* Increase Google Friendliness
* Better/Increase Google Ranking
* Search Engine Optimization (Note: In Australia we spell optimization with an "s" [optimisation] but most people searching online would use the American way of spelling it. So this have to be taken into consideration)


 **SSW Rules pages are testimonies to the fact that keywords and content are the keys to better Google rankings.**  It is in Google's first results if you search for: [better Google rank](https&#58;//www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=better+google+rank&amp;gws_rd=cr%2cssl&amp;ei=_aM7VqivN4GJwgSuk4vYBA). It still ranks very well in other search engines.
