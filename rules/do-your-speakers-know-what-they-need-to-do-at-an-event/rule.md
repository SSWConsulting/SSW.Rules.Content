<p>It is really important that your speakers feel empowered, so make sure you give them the tools they need to run their event well.<br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>On the day of your event, chat to the speaker and give them the Speaker Checklist so ​they know how the day will run:<br></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">1. Agenda<br></h3><ul><li>Tell the audience the agenda, so they know the break times. <br></li><li><span style="background-color:initial;">We recommend the following breaks:</span><br></li></ul><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><img src="Schedule.jpg" alt="Schedule.jpg" style="margin:5px;" /></dl><p><strong>Figure: A schedule to give to your speakers to help with time keeping </strong><br></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">2. Breaks<br></h3><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Attendees will often ask you what time the break will start or finish, so if you write it down they can refer it instead of asking you! </p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-Tip">Tip: You can print out <a href="/Documents/break-ends-sheet.pdf">this PDF "Break-Ends-Sheet,"</a>​​ to keep them informed, without answering the same question many times! <br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-Tip">TIP: We also have a handy rule on this: https://rules.ssw.com.au/do-you-set-a-clear-end-time-for-breaks<br></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">3. Names​​​<br></h3><p>Draw yourself a rough diagram of the room, start with intros an​ then go around the room and write people's names down for future reference. It will make speaking to them later a lot more personal if you can learn their name.<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-Tip">​​Tip: Draw the table layout before people arrive - it's faster. It's also easy if you draw the view you see looking at the audience.<br></p><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><img src="Diagram-Desk-layout2.jpg" alt="Diagram-Desk-layout2.jpg" style="margin:5px;width:600px;height:450px;" /></dl><p><strong style="background-color:initial;">  Figure: An example of the room layout with attendee's name, and memorable things about the   m</strong><br></p><p></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">4. (Optional) Coffee Orders:</h3><ul><li>​Ask attendees what coffee they would like, or ask them to fill out an electronic form and give this to your admin staff</li></ul><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">​5.
