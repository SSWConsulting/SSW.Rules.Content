<span class='intro'> <p>It is really important that your speakers feel empowered, so&#160;make sure you give them the tools they need to run their&#160;event well.<br></p> </span>

<p>On the day of your event, chat to the&#160;speaker&#160;and give them the Speaker Checklist so ​they know how the day will run&#58;<br></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">1. Agenda<br></h3><ul><li>Tell the audience the agenda, so they&#160;know the break times.&#160;<br></li><li><span style="background-color&#58;initial;">We recommend the following breaks&#58;</span><br></li></ul><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><img src="Schedule.jpg" alt="Schedule.jpg" style="margin&#58;5px;" /></dl><p><strong>Figure&#58; A&#160;schedule to give to your speakers to help with time keeping&#160;</strong><br></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">2. Breaks<br></h3><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Attendees will often ask you what time the break will&#160;start&#160;or finish, so if you write it down they can refer it instead of asking you!&#160;</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-Tip">Tip&#58; You can print out&#160;<a href="/Documents/break-ends-sheet.pdf">this PDF &quot;Break-Ends-Sheet,&quot;</a>​​ to keep them informed, without answering the same question many times!&#160;<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-Tip">TIP&#58;&#160;We also have a handy rule on this&#58;&#160;https&#58;//rules.ssw.com.au/do-you-set-a-clear-end-time-for-breaks<br></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">3. Names​​​<br></h3><p>Draw yourself a rough diagram of the room, start with intros an​ then go around the room&#160;and write people's names down for future reference. It will make speaking to them later a lot more personal if you can learn their name.<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-Tip">​​Tip&#58; Draw the table layout before people&#160;arrive -&#160;it's&#160;faster. It's also easy if you draw the view you see looking at the audience.<br></p><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><img src="Diagram-Desk-layout2.jpg" alt="Diagram-Desk-layout2.jpg" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;600px;height&#58;450px;" /></dl><p><strong style="background-color&#58;initial;">&#160;&#160;Figure&#58; An&#160;example of the&#160;room layout with attendee's name, and&#160;memorable things about the&#160; &#160;m</strong><br></p><p></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">4. (Optional) Coffee Orders&#58;</h3><ul><li>​Ask attendees&#160;what coffee they would like, or ask them to fill out an electronic form and give this to your admin staff</li></ul><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">​5. Evaluations&#58;<br></h3><ul><li>Please give your evaluation forms out around 4pm to give people time to complete them.</li></ul><br>
