<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>On the day of your event, chat to the&#160;speaker&#160;and give them the Speaker Checklist so ​they know how the day will run&#58;<br></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">1.

Breaks<br></h3><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Attendees will often ask you what time the break will&#160;start&#160;or finish, so if you write it down they can refer it instead of asking you!&#160;</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-Tip">Tip&#58; You can print out&#160;<a href="/Documents/break-ends-sheet.pdf">this PDF &quot;Break-Ends-Sheet,&quot;</a>​​ to keep them informed, without answering the same question many times!&#160;<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-Tip">TIP&#58;&#160;We also have a handy rule on this&#58;&#160;https&#58;//rules.ssw.com.au/do-you-set-a-clear-end-time-for-breaks<br></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">3. Names​​​<br></h3><p>Draw yourself a rough diagram of the room, start with intros an​ then go around the room&#160;and write people's names down for future reference.
