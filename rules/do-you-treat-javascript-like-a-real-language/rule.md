JavaScript is a real language and should be treated like one!
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<div><span style="line-height&#58;20px;">Would you put all your C# code in one file? Would you write single modules with every method your application could need? &#160;Of course not!</span></div><span style="line-height&#58;20px;">It's important to maintain coding standards when writing JavaScript just as you would when writing C#.</span><p></p><div><span style="line-height&#58;20px;">Where appropriate, try to follow the <a href="/SoftwareDevelopment/RulestobetterArchitectureandCodeReview">Rules to Better Architecture and Code Review</a> with your JavaScript as well. &#160;In particular, make sure you're still following the SOLID principles as much as you can.</span></div>
