ChatGPT is an incredibly powerful tool. GPT-4 is a noticeable improvement over GPT-3.5, and we can only expect the subsequent models to be even more impressive. For now, it does have its skills and weaknesses. 

Here are the most important things for which we know it to be useful (and not):

And there are also areas where it performs poorly.

## ❌ Dont use it for

### 1. Non-textual information

It is not designed to process or generate images, audio, or other non-textual information.

### 2. Mathematics

While it can handle basic arithmetic and some mathematical concepts, it is not designed for advanced or complex mathematical problem-solving.

### 3. Emotion and empathy

It can mimic emotions, but it doesn't truly experience or understand them, which can lead to inappropriate or tone-deaf responses.

### 4. Context understanding

It may struggle with understanding context and maintaining continuity when a conversation gets long. 🤖
