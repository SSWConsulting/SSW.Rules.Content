The word "but" often sounds negative and creates friction—even when you're agreeing. Phrases like *"Yes, but...”* can come across as dismissive, subtly negating what was just said. This can make the other person feel unheard or contradicted.

Instead, try using *"Yes, and..."* to acknowledge the previous point and build upon it. This approach encourages collaboration and keeps conversations constructive.

### 💼 Sales Tip

When a client questions the price, don’t say:

::: greybox
“Yes, but it’s expensive because we put a lot of effort into it.”
:::
::: bad
Figure: Bad example – Sounds apologetic and defensive.
:::

Instead, use confidence and the “yes, and” approach:

::: greybox
“Yes, and that’s because we put a lot of effort into it.”
:::
::: good
Figure: Good example – Acknowledges the concern and reinforces the value.
:::

Stand behind your value. The language you use shapes how your price is perceived.
