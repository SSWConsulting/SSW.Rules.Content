The word "but" often sounds negative and creates friction—even when you're agreeing. Phrases like *"Yes, but...”* can come across as dismissive, subtly negating what was just said. This can make the other person feel unheard or contradicted.

Instead, try using *"Yes, and..."* to acknowledge the previous point and build upon it. This approach encourages collaboration and keeps conversations constructive.
