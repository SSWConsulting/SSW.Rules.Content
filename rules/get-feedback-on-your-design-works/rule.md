One of the many reasons Figma is the most recommended software for designing user experience is Figma made the design process more open and inclusive. 

By enabling more people to contribute and share feedback, teams can create more creative and comprehensive solutions that reflect a wider range of perspectives.

Figma comment feature helps teams manage and incorporate feedback throughout the design process. Team members can easily add and reply to comments on files and prototypes using the browser or Figma desktop and even on Figma mobile app.

## Resolve comments after resolve an issue

When you've reached an agreement, or have resolved an issue, remember to resolve the comment.

Figma will remove the comment icon from the prototype to make your canvas clean and tidy. 

Note: resolved comments can be turned back on by showing resolved comments on the prototype.
