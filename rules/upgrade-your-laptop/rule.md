Electronic gadgets should have an expiry date because their performance fades as we use them frequently. Having a track of lot of computers is not an easy task, even though we use an asset management tool.  

For example, in the IT industry, laptops are the tools of the trade. Employees often spend thousands of $ and get a laptop with high specs and think it will be good for the next 10 years or so. We might not notice, but the old laptops don't give a good performance, which can reduce the production time of an employee causing a great loss for the company.

The problem with laptops and other electronic devices (e.g. mobiles) is that, as we use them, the processor gets weaker and doesn't give the same performance as when it was new. 

Keep your fleet updated by not having one employee buy a new laptop every 3 years while another replaces theirs every 10 years.



### How long do laptops generally last?

Most experts estimate a laptop’s lifespan to be 3 to 5 years. While a laptop might survive longer, its utility will be limited as the components become less capable of running advanced applications. https://www.empowerit.com.au/blog/it-planning/budgeting/laptops-desktops-how-long-do-they-last/ 

To keep track of a laptop's lifespan, we can use asset management tools like snipe https://snipeitapp.com/ and use the audit option. The option allows a review date to be set after a period of time ( 5 years is recommended) so that the user knows to upgrade the laptop

### What to do with an old laptop?

These laptops are all assets tagged in Snipe that are older than 5 years. 

To get the count of laptops consistent, companies should pick up a time e.g. 5 years to sell them, preferably on eBay.

Electronic devices like laptops, hard drives, servers, etc will stop working and may not be worth selling then what? As per the Australian government policies we have a policy to E-waste electronic devices. To decommission hard drives, we have to format them first and then drill the disk to destroy the data.

### How assets are disposed of (e-waste services)?

1. Check your item is accepted for electronic recycling [E-waste asset list](https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/questions/dispose-or-recycle-e-waste)
2. Backup and delete any data from laptops, tablets, printers, and servers before you recycle them
3. Hard drives - Wipe them and/or drill them (recommended) to avoid data leak
4. Update the e-waste devices to archive them on the Asset management tool
