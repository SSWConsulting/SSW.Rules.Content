Electronic gadgets should have an expiry date because their performance fades as we use them frequently.

For example, in the IT industry, laptops are the tools of the trade. Employees often spend thousands of $ and get a laptop with high specs and thinking it will be good for the next 10 years or so. 

The problem with laptops and other electronic devices (e.g. mobiles) is that, as we use them, the processor gets weaker and doesn't give the same performance as when it was new. 

Most experts estimate a laptop’s lifespan to be 3 to 5 years. While a laptop might survive longer, its utility will be limited as the components become less capable of running advanced applications. https://www.empowerit.com.au/blog/it-planning/budgeting/laptops-desktops-how-long-do-they-last/ 

### How long do laptops generally last?

To keep track of a laptop's lifespan, we can use asset management tools like snipe https://snipeitapp.com/ and use the audit option. The option allows a review date to be set after a period of time ( 5 years is recommended) so that the user knows to upgrade the laptop

### What to do with an old laptop?

These laptops are all assets tagged in Snipe that are older than 5 years. 

We have a policy to get rid of laptops older than 5 years by selling them on eBay or if not working E-waste
