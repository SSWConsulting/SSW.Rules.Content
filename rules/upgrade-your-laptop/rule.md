Electronic gadgets should have an expiry date because their performance fades as we use them. 

For example, in the IT industry, laptops are the tools of the trade. Employees often spend thousands of $ and get a laptop with high specs. However, often these laptops deteriorate and have bad performance in just a few years. In that case, employees might not even realize that their laptop is no longer performing well. So, there are a few things that should be done with laptops in a company's fleet.

* Rotation - Keep the fleet up-to-date
* Waste management - Recycle old laptops

### Rotation - Keep the fleet up-to-date

It is crucial to make sure the laptops in your fleet are fit for purpose and performant. In the old days people used to [Benchmark their laptops](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/do-you-benchmark-your-pc) and its still useful for personal machines, however it is not the best method for enterprise asset management. 

Enterprises should buy laptops with standardized specs that way they know that all their machines will need to be replaced at the same time. Then they can set up an automatic policy to rotate laptops on a regular cadence e.g. every 5 years. 

#### How do you figure out what cadence you replace laptops at?

Most experts estimate a laptop’s lifespan to be [2 to 3 years](https://www.empowerit.com.au/blog/it-planning/budgeting/laptops-desktops-how-long-do-they-last/). While a laptop might survive longer, its utility will be limited as the components become less capable of running advanced applications. So base your cadence on this.

#### How do you track your assets
To keep track of a laptop's lifespan, use asset management tools like [Snipe-IT](https://snipeitapp.com/) and use the audit option. That option allows a review date to be set after a period of time (5 years is recommended) so that the user knows to upgrade the laptop. 


### Waste management - Recycle old laptops
Once you have determined a laptop is no longer an asset to keep, then there are two options:
1. Sell it (Recommended)
2. Recycle - Dispose of e-waste

#### Sell it (Recommended)
You want to keep your fleet modern, but that doesn't mean the assets you are getting rid of are worthless. So, to get back a few $$$ sell the old assets online.

#### Recycle - Dispose of e-waste
Sometimes electronic devices stop working and can't be sold for significant $. Most Australian states require old electronic devices (e-waste) to be recycled, so follow the policy of the state your company operates in
e.g. [NSW Government e-waste policy](https://www.epa.nsw.gov.au/your-environment/recycling-and-reuse/warr-strategy/product-stewardship-schemes/ewaste#:~:text=The%20NSW%20Government%20supports%20the,computers%2C%20printers%20and%20computer%20products)

### How do you dispose of e-waste

1. Check your item is accepted for electronic recycling via your state government policy e.g. [NSW e-waste policy](https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/questions/dispose-or-recycle-e-waste)
2. Backup and delete any data from laptops, tablets, printers, and servers before you recycle them
3. Hard drives - Securely format them or drill them to avoid data theft 
4. Update the e-waste devices to archive them on the Asset management tool
