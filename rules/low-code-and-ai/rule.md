Repetitive tasks like updating spreadsheets, sending reminders, and syncing data between services are time-consuming and distract your team from higher-value work. Businesses that fail to automate these tasks fall behind.

The goal is to move from humans doing and approving the work, to automation doing and humans approving the work.

Low-code platforms with built-in or easy AI integration make automation more accessible than ever, even for non-developers. These tools empower staff to create powerful workflows that once required a full-stack developer to implement.

## Benefits

Modern businesses run on digital processes. But without automation, these processes can become a drain on resources. By adopting low-code automation platforms, you can:

* Eliminate repetitive manual tasks
* Increase accuracy and consistency
* Free up developer time for higher-value work
* Create scalable, reusable automations
* Easily integrate with AI tools for content generation, decision-making, and more

## How to Start

1. **Identify** repetitive tasks that consume time
2. **Choose** the right platform (see below)
3. **Start simple** by making an [MVP](/rules/poc-vs-mvp) e.g. turning a form submission into a Teams message
4. **Add AI** if needed to generate content, analyze data, etc.
5. **Test and iterate** once your tool is working
