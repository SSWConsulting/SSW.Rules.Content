Low-code platforms with built-in or easy AI integration make automation more accessible than ever, even for non-developers. These tools empower staff to create powerful workflows that once required a full-stack developer to implement.

## Benefits

Modern businesses run on digital processes. But without automation, these processes can become a drain on resources. By adopting low-code automation platforms, you can:

* Eliminate repetitive manual tasks
* Increase accuracy and consistency
* Free up developer time for higher-value work
* Create scalable, reusable automations
* Easily integrate with AI tools for content generation, decision-making, and more

## How to Start

1. **Identify** repetitive tasks that consume time
2. **Choose** the right platform (see below)
3. **Start simple** by making an [MVP](/rules/poc-vs-mvp) e.g. turning a form submission into a Teams message
4. **Add AI** if needed to generate content, analyze data, etc.
5. **Test and iterate** once your tool is working
