When communicating important information via email, it's crucial to ensure that the main purpose of the email is immediately clear. Burying the headline, or placing the primary message deep within the text, can lead to confusion and miscommunication. This is especially important in software development, where clarity and precision are paramount.

Imagine this scenario: 

Hey Reena  
I find that 5 lines of the Act, not at all easy to read. I tried twice. Also on your email, I did not pick up your meaning on the first read. On the second read, it is clear. I wondered why…. I think the “Thanks Anastasia” inferred she had done the right thing. I think when you are highlighting a mistake, don’t bury the headline. So I would have said “Hi Anastasia, FYI this was not needed”

In this scenario, the critical message is obscured by less relevant details. By bringing the main point to the forefront, you ensure the recipient understands the purpose of the email on the first read.

### Key Points

1. **State the Main Purpose Early**
   - The main purpose of the email should be in the first sentence or two. This helps ensure that even if the recipient skims the email, they understand the primary message.

2. **Clarity Over Complexity**
   - An email should be able to be read once to understand what it is about. Avoid complex sentences or burying the important information in lengthy paragraphs.

### Practical Example

Here's how you can improve email clarity by not burying the headline:

::: greybox
Hi Anastasia,

FYI, this was not needed.

Thanks,
Reena

In contrast:

::: greybox
Hey Anastasia,

Thanks for your help with the project. I reviewed the document and noticed a few things. The updates you made were mostly good, but some sections were unnecessary. I think it's better if we avoid adding those changes.

Best,
Reena

### Tips for Effective Email Communication

- **Keep it Brief**: Long emails can lose the recipient's attention. Keep your emails concise and to the point.
- **Use Clear Subject Lines**: Ensure the email subject line reflects the main content of the email.
- **Highlight Key Information**: Use formatting tools like bold or bullet points to highlight crucial points.
- **Summarize When Necessary**: If the email contains detailed information, start with a brief summary of the main points.

By following these guidelines, you can improve the clarity and effectiveness of your email communications, ensuring that important messages are understood quickly and accurately.
