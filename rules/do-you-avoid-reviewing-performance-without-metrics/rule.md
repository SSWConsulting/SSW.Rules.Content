<span class='intro'> 
  <p>​If a client says&#58;<br></p>
<div class="greyBox">
<em>&quot;This application is too slow, I don't really want to put up with such poor performance. Please fix.&quot;</em></div>
<p>We don't jump in and look at the code and clean it up and reply with something like&#58;</p>
<div class="greyBox"><em>&quot;I've looked at the code and cleaned it up - not sure if this is suitable - please tell me if you are OK with the performance now.&quot;</em></div>
 </span>

<p>A better way is&#58;</p><ul><li>Ask the client to tell us how slow it is (in seconds) and how fast they ideally would like it (in seconds)</li><li>Add some code to record the time the function takes to run</li><li>Reproduce the steps and record the time</li><li>Change the code</li><li>Reproduce the steps and record the time again</li><li>Reply to the customer&#58;<br>&quot;It was 22 seconds, you asked for around 10 seconds. It is now 8 seconds.&quot;<br></li></ul><dl class="image"><dt><img src="Code-Auditor-performance.jpg" alt=" " class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good example – Add some code to check the timing, before fixing any performance issues (An example from SSW Code Auditor)</dd></dl><p>Also, never forget to do incremental changes in your tests!</p><p>For example, if you are trying to measure the optimal number of processors for&#160;a&#160;server, do not go from 1 processor to 4 processors at once&#58;</p><dl class="badImage"><dt><img src="1to4.png" alt="1to4.png" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Bad Example - Going from 1 to 4 all at once gives you incomplete measurements and data</dd></dl><p>Do it incrementally, adding 1 processor each time, measuring the results, and then adding more&#58;</p><dl class="goodImage"><dt><img src="1234.png" alt="1234.png" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good Example - Going from 1 to 2, then measuring, then incrementally adding one more, measuring...</dd></dl><p>This gives you the most complete set of data to work from.</p><p>This is because performance is an emotional thing, sometimes it just *feels* slower. Without numbers, a person cannot really know for sure whether something has become quicker.&#160;By making the changes incrementally, you can be assured that there aren’t bad changes canceling out the effect of good changes.​</p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Samples​<br></h3><p>For sample code on how to measure performance for Windows application form, please refer to rule <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterUnitTests.aspx#Performance">Do you have tests for Performance?</a>&#160;on <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterUnitTests.aspx">Rules To Better Unit Tests</a>.</p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Related Rule</h3><ul><li><a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=cb28d27b-542f-4f02-bfa4-31b3672ed0d5">Do you keep your website loading ti​me acceptable?</a>​<br></li><li><a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=30c5fcee-c2e9-4705-9a87-a910edb57ae3">Do you know the steps required to implement a performance improvement?</a><br></li></ul>
