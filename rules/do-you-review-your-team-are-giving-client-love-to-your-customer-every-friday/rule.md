Developers should carry out "Client Love" every week.

There are a few ways to achieve this...

<!--endintro-->

1. From an overall team perspective, you can check in with the Scrum Master about how the Scrum Retrospective meetings are going. You can see an overview in the [Review/Retro email](/sprint-review-retro-email).
2. From an individual developer perspective, you can check their time sheets on Friday to look for extra initiative shown.

See [Rules
To Being Software Consultants Dealing With Clients](/do-you-build-the-client-relationship-by-completing-＂client-love＂-each-week-%28aka-customer-love%29).
