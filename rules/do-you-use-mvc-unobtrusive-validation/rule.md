Validation is an important part of any data-driven web application. Client-Side validation provides fast user feedback and a better UI experience but cannot be relied on for data integrity - so client-side validation should always be backed by additional server-side validation.

With MVC Unobtrusive Validation, you can configure both client-side and server-side in one place.

<!--endintro-->

Validation rules can be added to a model object via Data Annotations or using the Fluent Validation API.

Fluent Validation is [available as a Nuget package](http://www.nuget.org/packages/FluentValidation/). See [Do you use Fluent Validation?](/use-fluent-validation)

![Figure: OK Example - Data Annotation attributes decorate model properties to make them required](DataAttributes.png)

![Figure: Better Example - Fluent Validation allows validation metadata to be added to a class without modifying the original class.  This provides much more flexibility for code reuse](FluentValidation.png)

If you create a new MVC web application in VisualStudio 2013, unobtrusive validation will be enabled by default. Otherwise, it's simple to [install from Nuget](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.jQuery.Unobtrusive.Validation/). To use it simply:

1. Bind your razor views to model objects
2. Use Html Helpers to render the form UI
