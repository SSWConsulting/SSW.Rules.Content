If you are unable to show a progress bar, you should still indicate that it may take be a long process. For example, if installation takes more than 5 minutes, let your users know so they can get on with something else:

<!--endintro-->
<dl class="badImage">&lt;dt&gt;<img alt="An unknown length of time " src="../../assets/UnknownLengthTime.jpg">&lt;/dt&gt;
<dd>Figure: Bad example - An unknown length of time. So let them know</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage">&lt;dt&gt;<img alt="The coffee cup tells the user that they will be here a while" src="../../assets/CoffeeCup.jpg">&lt;/dt&gt;
<dd>Figure: Good example – The coffee cup tells the user that they will be here a while</dd></dl>
