Having a nice chat with clients is great but you should always finish the conversation with something to action. For example, if they wanted their requirements changed you should send them a confirmation email if they wanted to schedule a meeting you should send them an Outlook appointment. Here are some more examples of typical things you action after a call:

* Add contact details to the company database
* Pass the call to someone else
* Start work
* Remind yourself to follow up with another phone call
