<span class='intro'> 
  <p>At the end of every Sprint the Development&#160;Team performs a Sprint Retrospective also&#160;known as the Retro.&#160;The Retro&#160;provides an opportunity for the Scrum&#160;Team&#160;to reflect on what has gone well, what has gone poorly, and what the team wants to change.&#160;<br></p>
<p>Inspect-and-adapt is a key component of the Scrum framework and the Retro&#160;gives Scrum Teams an opportunity to learn from their&#160;successes and&#160;mistakes.</p>
 </span>

<div>The Retro is a time-boxed event that focuses around 3 questions&#58;</div>
<div><ul><li>What went well?</li>
<li>What didn't go well?</li>
<li>What will we do differently in the next Sprint?</li></ul></div>
<div></div>
<div>The Scrum Master facilitates the meeting and&#160;collects issues as they are raised.&#160;Once every Scrum Team Member has spoken he&#160;facilitates debate on each issue&#160;so that team consensus is achieved.&#160; The result should produce an actionable outcome, for&#160;example&#58;</div>
<ul>
    <li>An adjustment&#160;is made to the daily processes followed by the Scrum Team</li>
    <li>An adjustment is made to the <a href="/Pages/RetrospectiveMeeting.aspx">Definition of Done</a></li>
    <li>An adjustment is made at the organisation level</li>
    <li>An item is added to the Product Backlog</li>
</ul>
<p>To help aid discussion it can be useful for the Scrum Master to prepare items for review by inspecting the Sprint Backlog and statistics such as&#58;</p>
<ul>
<li>Velocity<br></li>
<li>the Burndown</li>
<li>Code Coverage<br></li><li>Number of deployments<br></li><li>Number of errors in Application Insights​<br></li>
</ul>
<p>For example the Scrum Master can find PBIs (Product Backlog Items)&#160;in the Sprint that were successful / not successful and then facilitate the discussion as to why.

<p>Once all issues have been discussed to the satisfaction of The Scrum Team, the meeting concludes.<br>
<br>
If the timebox limit is reached, the remaining issues should be recorded and dealt with by the Scrum&#160;Master.&#160; Any&#160;outstanding issues must be&#160;raised at the next Retrospective if they are still relevant.<br>
<br>
The time-box for this meeting is usually as many hours as weeks in the Sprint.<br></p>
