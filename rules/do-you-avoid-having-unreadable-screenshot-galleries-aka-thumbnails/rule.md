Many websites have screenshots images to illustrate content instructions. With so many different screens sizes and resolutions, you probably have seen a screenshot that was unreadable. You don't want that in your website. Always make sure the screenshots you share as content are readable to the user. To ensure that, you may need to crop the images, keeping only the parts that are relevant to what you are showing. 

In the cases where you do need a full screenshot, it's a good idea to allow users to open the image in a bigger size, using [lightboxes](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_lightbox.asp) for example.
