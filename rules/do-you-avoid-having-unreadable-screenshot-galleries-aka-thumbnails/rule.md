<p>Many sites have screenshot galleries that offer a list of all the screens within an application, and an option to enlarge them. There's just one problem: you can't see what they contain!</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<dl class="badImage"><dt><img src="ScreenGalleryBad.gif" alt="Bad Screen Gallery" /></dt><dd>Figure: Bad Example - The contents of the screenshots are difficult to make out</dd></dl><p>What we suggest as an alternative is to have one large image - full size - (and possibly a list of descriptions) to allow users to have a large screenshot to view right from the get go. This might look something like:</p><dl class="goodImage"><dt><img src="ScreenGalleryGood.jpg" alt="" /></dt><dd>Figure: Good Example - This is a viable alternative to a typical image gallery.</dd></dl><p>Our <a href="https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/UserGuide.aspx">Code Auditor User Guide</a> provides a good example for this rule. </p>
