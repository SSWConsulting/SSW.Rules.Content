<p>It is easy to think that 
  &quot;Content is King&quot;; it is a well-known 
      <a href="http&#58;//www.craigbailey.net/content-is-king-by-bill-gates/">quote from an article by Bill Gates in 1996</a>. &#160;But 
  incorrect content is not &#160;very useful, so we think that &quot;<strong>factual</strong> content is king&quot;.</p>

<p>You should always&#58;</p><ul><li>Fix up your mistakes, and</li>
<li>Strike through content that is now been superseded, and add a comment. E.g. &quot;This is now not an issue as it was fixed up in TFS SP1&quot;
</li></ul>
