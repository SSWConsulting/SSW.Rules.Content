Managing recurring tasks effectively can be a major challenge, especially when you don’t have visibility into whether tasks are completed on time or not. 

Previously, we relied on manual methods like recurring calendar appointments or reminders. However, these approaches made it difficult to track the status of tasks and understand each team member's workload. Microsoft Planner and Power Automate offer a better solution, allowing you to manage, automate, and gain insight into recurring tasks for your team.

### Why Use Microsoft Planner and Power Automate?

By using Microsoft Planner and Power Automate, you can streamline recurring task management:
- **Microsoft Planner** organizes and assigns tasks to team members, showing progress and status.
- **Power Automate** adds automation, creating tasks at the right time, notifying team members, and syncing with other platforms like Outlook and Teams.

### How to Set It Up in Three Steps

1. **Create a Plan in Microsoft Planner**
   - Ensure your Microsoft Teams setup has a dedicated team for task assignments.
   - Link the newly created plan to the appropriate team.
   - This gives you an overview of tasks and their current status.

2. **Set Up Recurring Tasks**
   - Use Microsoft Planner’s built-in recurrence feature to create tasks that repeat daily, weekly, or at any specified interval.
   - Example: Assign a task for team members to complete every weekday, such as sending a status update.

3. **Automate with Power Automate (Optional)**
   - Go beyond Planner’s capabilities by using Power Automate to generate tasks dynamically.
   - Customize task notifications to be sent to team members’ Outlook or Teams, ensuring they get reminders without needing to check Planner continuously.

### Benefits of Automation

- **Centralized Management**: Track and monitor the workload of your team from one place.
- **Timely Notifications**: Ensure team members get timely reminders where they usually work, like in their Outlook inbox or Teams notifications.
- **Visibility for Managers**: Managers can easily see overdue tasks and assess team performance.

### Example Scenario

**Recurring Task Setup for Team Visibility**  
Imagine needing a daily reminder for the marketing team to post updates. Instead of relying on each member to remember:
- **Microsoft Planner**: Creates a recurring task for “Post Daily Update.”
- **Power Automate**: Sends an email and a Teams notification when the task is due, ensuring no one forgets.
