<span class='intro'> <p>​Every email you process takes time. Sifting through unnecessary emails becomes really frustrating. Don't clog up someone else's Inbox with unnecessary emails.</p> </span>

<p>​A good rule of thumb for whether an email is unnecessary is if your email comprises of less than 5 words (e.g. &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;See you then&quot;) it's likely it doesn't need to be sent.</p><p>Merely saying &quot;thanks&quot; is often not sufficient to warrant the email but an exception to this rule is when&#160;positive reinforcement should be used when someone has done a specific ​behaviour that you like and want to encourage. E.g. </p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox"> &quot;Thanks for being proactive and pointing out that improvement.&quot;</p>
