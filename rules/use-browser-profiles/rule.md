Imagine this... a client calls you in a panic when you are working at another client. You need to login to their DevOps portal to see the problem and so you sign out of your current clients DevOps portal ...wait... wait... get a 2-factor SMS... wait... and then finally get in! But then you notice it also knocked you out of the Azure Portal and your Office 365 email that you were previously signed into. Annoying!

### Microsoft Edge & Google Chrome Profiles allow you to use different credentials

Tips:

* Never log out
* Never use Incognito (where you need to login)
* Install your cool extensions in each of your Edge or Chrome profiles
* [Remove clutter from the new tab experience](/browser-remove-clutter) to increase focus
* [Set a different image for your new tab page](/browser-add-branding) for each of your browser profiles

Consultants usually work on different client projects and use different client credentials eg. Azure DevOps, Azure Portal and sometimes an email account with the clientâ€™s branding. Password managers are great, but going from client to client you have to continually switch between accounts by logging out and logging in with different credentials.

**Q:** Is this only for developers?   
**A:** No, my PA uses this (in her case, her "client" is Adam ðŸ˜‰)

Many people have an Office 365 account, and a personal Office 365 account. If you want to avoid keeping logging in and out to switch between them, try setting up a separate "person profile" for each in Edge or Chrome.

Make use of Edge or Chrome Profiles to separate your bookmarks, history, passwords and other browser settings for different clients and that means that the frequent log out and log in overhead is eliminated. Simply switch to a client specific Edge or Chrome Profile and all the credentials are automatically restored.
