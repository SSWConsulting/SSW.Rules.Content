Some of the network services, like TFS/Exchange/Database are essential for our business and people will not be able to work if any of these services is down or inaccessible. 
               When such thing happens, the first thing you need to do is to send notification to SysAdmins so they can start investigating the problem, and you should cc your project manager because those issues will stop you getting tasks done.
