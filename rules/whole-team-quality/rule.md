Might need some other content to differentiate between quality and testing before this makes sense (e.g. testing doesn’t improve quality). 

Idea is whole team approach stuff, not relying on someone with the role/title of “tester” to do the testing work

approach is to "build quality in" vs "test bugs out"

testing is an activity rather than a phase, we should aim to prevent bugs rather than focusing on finding them, look at testing over checking, aim to help build the best system possible instead of trying to break it, and emphasizes the whole team responsibility for quality.
