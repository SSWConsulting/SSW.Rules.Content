In a Scrum team, every member of the team has some responsibility for the quality of the deliverables of the team.

If you have a dedicated tester embedded in the Scrum team, they are not solely responsible for performing all of the types of testing required to help build a quality deliverable.

The idea of adopting a "whole team approach to quality" is to **build quality into** the software rather than trying to **test the problems out** of it at the end.

## So, what is "quality"?

There are many definitions of "quality". A simple but very useful definition is:

> Quality is value to some person(s) who matter(s)\
>     - Jerry Weinberg (with changes by Michael Bolton & James Bach)

This definition highlights the fact that quality is a relationship between the user and the product - it's not the product itself, nor an element of the product. The user's perception of value is also subjective. Acknowledging the subjective nature of quality is important, so that we don't fall into the trap of trying to measure it. Quality is more amenable to assessment than it is to measurement.

## Testing &ne; quality

Testing alone does nothing to improve quality. Testing provides valuable information about the software - and the processes involved in creating it, building it and deploying it - and it is only be acting on this information that quality may be improved.

## Testing and the whole team

Every member of the Scrum team has their part to play in building quality into their deliverables. There are different kinds of testing activities that rely on different skills found across the various people in a diverse Scrum team. The idea is not to rely on someone with the role/title of "tester" to do *all* of the testing work!

This mission statement from Atlassian is a good expression of modern testing and quality management:

::: greybox
"We want to help ship awesome software, not just prevent poor software from being released"
*Atlassian Quality Engineering mission (from job advertisement, April 2020)*
:::

Idea is whole team approach stuff, 


testing is an activity rather than a phase, we should aim to prevent bugs rather than focusing on finding them, look at testing over checking, aim to help build the best system possible instead of trying to break it, and emphasizes the whole team responsibility for quality.

## Some anti-patterns

"testing phase", asking how did QA miss this bug, test a sprint behind dev, focus on meeting sprint commitment over DoD
