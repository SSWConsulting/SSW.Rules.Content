<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">A buyer persona is, according to Hub​Spot, a semi-fictional representation of your ideal customer. It's based on market research, actual data about your existing customers, and a few (educated) assumptions. It helps you to understand and relate to an audience that you want to market your products and services to. ​<br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​When creating your buyer persona, you should include customer demographics, behaviour​​ patterns, motivations, and goals. The more specific you can be, the better. Variations of your buyer persona would also help understand and shape strategy and communication to sell your service/product, for example: "Can only men purchase my product? Or women too? Or maybe children eventually? How old can they be? Are they only local? Can I consider selling it to other states?"<br></p><dl class="image"><dt><img src="buyer-persona-example.png" alt="buyer-persona-example.png" style="width:750px;" /></dt><dd>Figure: Example of questions you need to answer in order to identify your buyer persona​<br></dd></dl>
