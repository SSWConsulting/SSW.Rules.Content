Written communication can easily cause misunderstandings. Help the reader understand your message better by:

* Using “&gt;” and indentation when quoting the text from others, like the original email you are replying to, or a web page, etc.
* Your new text should be kept to the left
* Optionally, [use a different text color in your reply](/when-you-reply-inline-do-you-use-a-different-color)
* Add numbers if the sender didn't and it is appropriate

<!--endintro-->

This way you won't forget any questions in the original email.

### Hi Adam,  

Please change from X to Y   
The program flow logic worries me a bit   
Done. Sorry, this wasn't a final decision - I just put it there for testing purposes

### Hi Adam,  

     &gt; 1. Please change from X to Y  
Done - \[add a link to the page or a screenshot\];

**Note:** For those using mobile devices the indentation function is not available, try instead using 3 spaces to indent manually.
