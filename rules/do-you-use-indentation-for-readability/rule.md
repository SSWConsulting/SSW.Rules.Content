Another thing that helps readability in emails is  **indentation** .

::: greybox
I’m on site with a client setting up their TFS Server. We have the TFS 2010 and WSS on the app tier and SQL 2008 Standard on a separate box. We can see Analysis Services running in Services but the configuration manager returns Error “TF 255040: You must exit Team Foundation Admin console and install SQL Server Reporting Services or at a minimum SQL Client Connectivity Tools…” SQL Reporting Services appears happy in the Advanced Configuration Wizard. Anyone have suggestions?

Your new text should be kept to the left. When quoting text on web pages, other people or quoting past email history, indent it.

**Note:** This is almost as important as the     [Do you use balloons instead of a 'Wall of Text'?](/screenshots-do-you-use-balloons-instead-of-a-wall-of-text) rule.
