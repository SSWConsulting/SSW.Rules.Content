Written communication can easily cause misunderstandings. Help the reader understand your message better by:

* Using “&gt;” and indentation when quoting the text from others, like the original email you are replying to, or a web page, etc.
* Your new text should be kept to the left
* Optionally, [use a different text color in your reply](/when-you-reply-inline-do-you-use-a-different-color)
* Add numbers if the sender didn't and it is appropriate

<!--endintro-->

This way you won't forget any questions in the original email.

**Note:** 
- When using Outlook, the raw “>” character may be automatically formatted to a “>” bullet point. This change is a problem because it may change to a normal bullet point after being sent. To prevent this issue, press Control+Z to turn it back into the raw “>” character.
- For those using mobile devices the indentation function is not available, try instead using 3 spaces to indent manually.

## GitHub

When using GitHub, you can use 4 spaces to indent a task and get clear separation between task and response. You can also use a "&gt;" symbol to achieve a similar result.
