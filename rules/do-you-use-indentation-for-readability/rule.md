Another thing that helps readability in emails is <strong>indentation</strong>. 

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<font class="ms-rteCustom-GreyBox" size="+0">I’m on site with a client setting up their TFS Server. We have the TFS 2010 and WSS on the app tier and SQL 2008 Standard on a separate box. We can see Analysis Services running in Services but the configuration manager returns Error “TF 255040&#58; You must exit Team Foundation Admin console and install SQL Server Reporting Services or at a minimum SQL Client Connectivity Tools…” SQL Reporting Services appears happy in the Advanced Configuration Wizard. Anyone have suggestions?
