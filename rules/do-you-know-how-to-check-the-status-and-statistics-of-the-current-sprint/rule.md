<span class='intro'> <p>Developers think they are done when they finish coding and check in.<br></p>
<p>Wrong. It is much better to <a href="/Pages/Do-You-Run-Acceptance-Tests.aspx">use Microsoft Test Manager (MTM) and step through the Acceptance Tests.</a></p>
<p>Once you are doing that, this is how you check the status of the current Sprint&#58;</p> </span>

<dl class="image"><dt><img alt="run acceptance tests" src="check-sprint-status.jpg" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good example - This Sprint currently has 2 'Failed' tests (red), and 1 'Active' test (blue). (This 'Results' view is new in MTM 2012) </dd></dl> 
<p>Key&#58; 
   <br><ul><li>The red is work remaining for the developers, and&#160;<br></li><li>The blue is working remaining for the testers (unfinished testing)<br></li></ul></p>
