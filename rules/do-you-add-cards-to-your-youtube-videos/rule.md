<span class='intro'> <p>Cards on YouTube are an effective way to keep people watching your videos by suggesting&#160;to the viewer the other videos they could be interested in.</p> </span>

<p>You could also promote an external website <a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=bad882c6-59d2-4a8f-97be-a15c6dc19296">(just like with&#160;ed screens)</a> but remember you want people to stay on YouTube and keep watching your videos.</p><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><img src="/SiteAssets/cards-and-ending-screens/card%20example.png" alt="card example.png" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;808px;" /><br><br></dl><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Good example&#58; A card is discreet and adds an easy way for the viewer to get to the relevant content.<br></dd><p><br></p><p>Cards are like dynamic notifications in the top right corner of your video and you can choose the exact moment it should pop up.
