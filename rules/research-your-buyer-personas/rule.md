<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">A buyer persona is, according to&#160;Hub​Spot, a semi-fictional representation of your ideal customer. It's based on market research, actual data about your existing customers, and a few (educated) assumptions. It helps you to understand and relate to an audience that you want to market your products and services to.&#160;​<br></p>

<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​When creating your buyer persona, you should include customer demographics, behaviour​​ patterns, motivations, and goals. The more specific you can be, the better. Variations of your buyer persona would also help understand and shape strategy and communication to sell your service/product, for example&#58; &quot;Can only men purchase my product? Or women too? Or maybe children eventually? How old can they be? Are they only local? Can I consider selling it to other states?&quot;<br></p><dl class="image"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/buyer-persona-example.png" alt="buyer-persona-example.png" style="width&#58;750px;" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Example of questions you need to answer in order to identify your buyer persona​<br></dd></dl>
