Using the wrong kind of dash in the wrong place makes sentencess less clear to the reader. Even though most people might not know the rules - using dashes incorrectly - can make your writing uncomfortble even to people who don't know the rules – it might just 'feel—off'

Using the right kind of dashes (em dash, en dash, and hyphen) in the right places makes your sentence more coherent, correct, and pretty.

<!--endintro-->

Em dash (—): Length of the letter "M"; used to indicate a break in thought or to emphasize a dramatic pause.

En dash (–): Length of the letter "N"; used as a connector or separator, especially in the format of a range of numbers or heading.

Hyphen (-): Used to link compound words, such as "jack-o'-lantern"
