To ensure your videos gain maximum exposure, you need to promote them in various ways. The following are the steps to do this.

<!--endintro-->

1. ## Add to social Media accounts
    Add link to the new video to all social media accounts including:

    * Twitter
    * Facebook
    * LinkedIn
2. ## Email all staff
    The second step is to email all the staff with the links to the posts you have made. You want to make it as easy as possible for them to be able to re-post the original messages. Use a tool like [http://clicktotweet.com/](http&#58;//clicktotweet.com/).

3. ## Email the interviewee
    The person(s) featured or interviewed in the video should be encouraged to share and promote your video. If they have an audience that follows them on social media you should leverage it to your advantage.
    Ask them to:

    * Email the video to their list
    * Write a blog post on their blog
    * Update their social media accounts with a link and description of the video

    Email template:

4. ## Contact strategic partners
    The best way to extend your reach and promote a video is through strategic partners. These are people, companies or websites which don’t compete with you but service the same audience. Examples of these types of partners are:

    * Blogger in your industry
    * Industry websites
    * If you are an accountant, partner with a financial planner, business coach, insurance salesman or prestige car dealer
    * Suppliers
    * Industry experts

    You should ask the partner to:

    * Email the video to their list
    * Write a blog post on their blog
    * Update their social media accounts with a link and description of the video

    You should have a list of these partners in a database with all their contact details to automate the process of promoting your videos.
