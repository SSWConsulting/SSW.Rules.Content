TypeScript is the new flagship language from Microsoft that compiles into JavasScript.

* Use JavaScript if you’re writing page specific script
* Use jQuery to improve cross-browser support
* Use TypeScript if you’re writing re-usable client side library


Don't use CoffeeScript (language is too different from JavaSript)
