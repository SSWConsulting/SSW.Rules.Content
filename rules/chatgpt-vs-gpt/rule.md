GPT and ChatGPT are similar tools that serve slightly different purposes. Each of them has strengths and weaknesses so it's crucial to understand the right time to use them.
            
<!--endintro-->

ChatGPT is strong at helping an individual do a specific task. For example, a user could could get responses to simple tasks like:
* "Write me a blog post on EF Core Code-First Migrations"
* "How do I create a table with EF Core?"
* "Can you help me find information about Northwind?"
* and much more...

On the other hand, GPT is better for tasks that require automation or programmatic integration. For example, it could be used to create systems for:
* Summarizing a page of text
* Tailoring inputs to output in a specific manner e.g. input a url, and it outputs an SSW rule
* Changing email content to fit a specific audience e.g. Product Owner, Developer, Designer etc
* and much more...

Additionally, GPT provides [an API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api) that developers can leverage.
