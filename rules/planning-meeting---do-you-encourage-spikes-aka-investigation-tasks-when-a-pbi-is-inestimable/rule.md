Sometimes it can be unclear to The Scrum Team whether a Story can be completed as required.  For example the story &quot;automatically package with Wise after the automatic build&quot; requires investigation and experimentation to see if this is possible and to provide a meaningful estimate for the original.

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>How is experimentation done? In agile software development, when you have an unknown, you do a spike story.  A spike is a time boxed investigation with the output being the answer to an experiment or investigation and the resolution of an estimate for the original story.</p>
<p>It is then best to write a new story “Investigate whether it is possible to automatically build with Wise”.&#160; This story can be more accurately estimated and the result will allow the original story to be estimated or revised.</p>

<b class="ms-rteCustom-FigureBad">Figure&#58; Bad example – I want you to implement something, but I am not going to tell you what it is. How long will it take?</b></p>
<p>To embark on the original story when it is inestimable would be irresponsible and leave The Team with a potentially impossible story and the risk of a failed sprint.</p>
<p>All investigating stories must be timeboxed otherwise the process of investigation can meander and never come to a conclusion. </p>

<b class="ms-rteCustom-FigureGood">Figure&#58; Good example – The spike (time boxed investigation) comes first as it is impossible to estimate implementing something you do not know</b></p>
<p>Note&#58; This gives you work for future Sprint</p>
