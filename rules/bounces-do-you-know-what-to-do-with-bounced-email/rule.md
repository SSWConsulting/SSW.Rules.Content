Having people report bounce back emails is frustrating and time consuming. The first thing to try when you get a report is to check that your mail server isn’t on a spam blacklist. An easy way to check this is via [MX Toolbox](http://mxtoolbox.com/).

<!--endintro-->

![Figure: Enter the domain to check](MXToolbox-1.jpg)

![Figure: Then select "Blacklist Check"](MXToolbox-2.jpg)

![Figure: Getting a zero is good, so you know that you are not blacklisted... so Step 1 is good](MXToolbox-3.jpg)

Next step check that you have primary and secondary (and even better tertiary) MX records setup and working.

![Figure: Seeing at least 2 MX records is good... Run an SMTP Test to test mail servers. So Step 2 is good](MXToolbox-4.jpg)

If success on both steps the error is most likely on the senders side. Send them the an email to check their mail settings.
