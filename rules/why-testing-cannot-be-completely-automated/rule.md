There is a common misconception that you can automate all the testing. 

While there can be great value in using automation in testing, human capabilities are still required for the key testing skills such as evaluation, experimentation, exploration, etc.


<!--endintro-->

Recall the distinction between testing and checking (see [Do you know what "testing" really means?](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/what-testing-really-means)):

::: info
**Testing** is the process of evaluating a product by learning about it through experiencing, exploring, and experimenting, which includes to some degree: questioning, study, modeling, observation, inference, etc.

**Checking** is the process of making evaluations by applying algorithmic decision rules to specific observations of a product.
:::

Checking is amendable to automation since machines are excellent at applying algorithmic rules. But testing, by this definition, clearly relies on human capabilities.

The next time someone suggests that you "automate the testing", remind them that this would mean:

â€œAutomate the evaluation\

and experimentation\
and modeling\
and studying of the specs\
and observation of the product\
and inference-drawing\
and questioning\
and risk assessment\
and prioritization\
and coverage analysis\
and pattern recognition\
and decision making\
and design of the test lab\
and preparation of the test lab\
and sensemaking\
and test code development\
and tool selection\
and recruiting of helpers\
and making test notes\
and preparing simulations\
and bug advocacy\
and triage\
and relationship building\
and analyzing platform dependencies\
and product configuration\
and application of oracles\
and spontaneous playful interaction with the product\
and discovery of new information\
and preparation of reports for management\
and recording of problems\
and investigation of problems\
and working out puzzling situations\
and building the test team\
and analyzing competitors\
and resolving conflicting information\
and benchmarking..."\
