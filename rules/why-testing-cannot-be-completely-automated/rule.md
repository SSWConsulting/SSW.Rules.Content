There is a common misconception that you can automate all the testing. 

While there can be great value in using automation in testing, human capabilities are still required for the key testing skills such as evaluation, experimentation, exploration, etc.


<!--endintro-->

Use testing and checking to make clear that what we now think of as “testing” requires human capabilities


Here’s an easy-to-remember little substitution that you can perform when someone suggests “automating the testing”: Bolton



“Automate the evaluation
and learning
and exploration
and experimentation
and modeling
and studying of the specs
and observation of the product
and inference-drawing
and questioning
and risk assessment
and prioritization
and coverage analysis
and pattern recognition
and decision making
and design of the test lab
and preparation of the test lab
and sensemaking
and test code development
and tool selection
and recruiting of helpers
and making test notes
and preparing simulations
and bug advocacy
and triage
and relationship building
and analyzing platform dependencies
and product configuration
and application of oracles
and spontaneous playful interaction with the product
and discovery of new information
and preparation of reports for management
and recording of problems
and investigation of problems
and working out puzzling situations
and building the test team
and analyzing competitors
and resolving conflicting information
and benchmarking…”
