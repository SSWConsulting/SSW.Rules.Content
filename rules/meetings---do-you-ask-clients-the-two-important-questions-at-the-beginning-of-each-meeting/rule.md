<span class='intro'> It is essential to clarify the purpose and time of meetings.<br>
When you commence each meeting you should ask the following two questions&#58;
 </span>


  <ol>
    <li>What are the points you want to cover in this meeting? </li>
    <li>How long will this meeting be? </li>
</ol>
<p>By asking these two questions you define both the client's and your expectations from the meeting; eliminating one of the factors which contribute to time-wastage.</p>
