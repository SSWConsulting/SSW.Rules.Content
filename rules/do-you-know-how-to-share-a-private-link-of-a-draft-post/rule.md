To share a draft of a post with others you need to install [the plugin called 'Public Post Preview'](https://wordpress.org/plugins/public-post-preview/).

<!--endintro-->

Once you have plugin installed, all you need to do is enable it and then follow the steps below:

1. In the 'Edit Post' page, scroll down below your HTML panel to the 'Preview' panel, and select the tick box "Allow Anonymous Preview".

Once enabled, it will create a preview link, that you can send to as many people as you like. 

**Note:** Once you publish the post the URL becomes inactive.

2. Click on 'Save Draft', then 'Preview'. The post will open in your browser, with the URL that you can share.

**Note:** Needing a plugin to share a URL privately seems a little bit crazy.
**Note:** Another solution is ‘Share a Draft’, however it has more options and is more complicated.

It has a time limit function for the post, which allows you to set and extend. The URL it generates is a bit messy.
