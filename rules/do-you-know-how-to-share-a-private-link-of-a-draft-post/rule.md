<p>To share a draft of a post with others you need to install a plugin.</p>
<p>The plugin is called 'Simple Preview' and can be located <a href="http&#58;//gabriel.nagmay.com/2009/10/simple-preview/" target="_blank">here</a> <img title="You are now leaving SSW" src="/_LAYOUTS/15/Images/SSW/external.gif" alt="" /> <img title="You are now leaving SSW" src="/_LAYOUTS/15/Images/SSW/external.gif" alt="" /> <img title="You are now leaving SSW" src="/_LAYOUTS/15/Images/SSW/external.gif" alt="" />.
</p>

<p>Once you have plugin installed, all you need to do is enable it and then follow the steps below&#58;</p>
<ol>
<li>In the 'Edit Post' page, scroll down below your HTML panel to the 'Preview' panel, and select the tick box &quot;Allow Anonymous Preview&quot;.<br>
Once enabled, it will create a preview link, that you can send to as many people as you like. <br>
<strong>Note&#58;</strong> Once you publish the post the URL becomes inactive.</li>
<li>Click on 'Save Draft', then 'Preview'. The post will open in your browser, with the URL that you can share.</li>
</ol>

<span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; The URL suffix will be similar to this&#58; ‘…?p=1418&amp;preview=true’</span>

<h4>More Information&#58;</h4>
<p>Note #1&#58; needing a plugin to share a URL privately, is a little bit crazy.</p>
<p>Note #2&#58; Another solution is ‘Share a Draft’, however it has more options and is more complicated.</p>
<p>It has a time limit function for the post, which allows you to set and extend. The URL it generates is a bit messy.</p>

<span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; The URL is pretty messy and it is not as simple as just ticking a box. This is a whole other page</span>
