<span class='intro'> <p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​It is a good idea to create a dummy company to represent all&#160;clients on internal documentation, including a made-up&#160;name for the person behind that company. At SSW, anytime we need&#160;an example of&#160;dealing with clients, we&#160;use&#160;the made-up&#160;company called &quot;Northwind&quot; which is managed by the also made-up​ client&#160;&quot;Mr. Bob Northwind&quot;,&#160;often&#160;referred to as just &quot;Bob&quot;.<br></p> </span>

<p>Most of documentation starts from a real world situation and we don't want to expose our real clients names.​</p><p class="greyBox"><b>Hi </b><b>Mark Zuckerberg</b>,<br>We need to make sure our project with <b>Facebook</b> will be approved before summer.<br>​<br>Regards<br></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad">Bad example - Using real people and real companies as examples<br></dd><p class="greyBox"><b>Hi Bob,</b><br>We need to make sure our project with <b>Northwind</b>&#160;will be approved before summer.<br>​<br>Regards<br></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Bad example - Using&#160;dummy&#160;consistent names on examples​<br></dd>
