Accidentally deleting important data can be a disaster for your users and your support team. A poorly placed or unclear destructive action can result in irreversible mistakes, lost data, and frustrated users.

These actions need to be carefully designed with strong visual cues, clear labels, and proper safeguards.

<!--endintro-->

## Use red for danger consistently

Destructive buttons should always stand out with a **red color**. This is a well-established visual convention that immediately signals danger to users.

* Use red **only** for destructive actions (not warnings or generic alerts)
* Avoid using red buttons for neutral or positive actions

::: good img-medium  
![Figure: Good example - Red is the right color for a destructive button](destruction-button-good-color.png)
:::

::: info
**Note:** If red is your branding primary color, you may use red for positive or neutral actions, as long as:

* The context clearly communicates a positive intent (e.g., ‚ÄúSubmit‚Äù, ‚ÄúContinue‚Äù, ‚ÄúBook now‚Äù)
* Consistency is maintained across all UI elements
* Ensure destructive actions are visually differentiated through contrast and hierarchy. E.g. A different tone of red and an appropriate icon
:::

## Use the right icon in the right position

Icons make buttons faster to recognize and reduce ambiguity. A trash can icon next to the label reinforces the nature of the action.

* Always use the trash can (`üóëÔ∏è`) or appropriate destructive icon
* Place the icon **to the left** of the button label
* Avoid ambiguous or abstract icons (E.g. Broom icon (`üßπ`) is used for ‚Äúclear all‚Äù or ‚Äúclean up", not "delete". Cross icon (`‚ùå`) means ‚Äúcancel‚Äù or "wrong", not "delete")

## Position destructive buttons with care

Placing a destructive button next to a primary action (e.g. "Save" or "Confirm") is dangerous. Users may misclick due to proximity.

* Place destructive buttons away from primary actions
* Use space or visual separation between them
* Make destructive buttons less prominent (except when the primary purpose is deletion)

::: bad

:::

::: good

## Ask for confirmation when necessary

Not every delete action needs a popup, but if the data is important or irreversible, you should ask the user to confirm.

Use confirmations when:

* Deleting data that can‚Äôt be recovered (e.g. a database record or user profile)
* The user might not realize the consequences

::: info
**Tip:** Avoid overusing confirmations as they lead to [alert fatigue](https://www.magicbell.com/blog/alert-fatigue).
:::

## Use tooltips

Sometimes you might have a UI with limited space that doesn‚Äôt allow text labels.

For **icon-only** destructive buttons (for example, a red trash icon in a table row), always provide a tooltip on hover or focus.

::: good

:::

## Ensure accessibility and keyboard navigation

Don't rely solely on color to convey meaning ‚Äî red may be hard to distinguish for users with color blindness.

* Include a label, not just an icon
* Make sure buttons can be navigated and triggered via keyboard
* Support screen readers with `aria-label="Delete project"` or similar

## Summary of best practices

| **Element**        | **Best practice**                                                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Color**          | Use red for destructive buttons                                   |
| **Label**          | Always include a text label (e.g. "Delete", "Remove")             |
| **Icon**           | Use a trash can or similar, to the left of label                  |
| **Placement**      | Isolate from primary/positive actions                             |
| **Confirmation**   | Use when deletion is permanent or high-risk                       |
| **Accessibility**  | Don't rely on color; support keyboard and screen readers          |
