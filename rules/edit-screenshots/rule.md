Screenshots are a super integral part of day-to-day business processes. So, it is important that you edit your screenshots to add extra info such as highlighting the critical parts.

Windows provides a default tool for taking and editing screenshots called the Snipping Tool. However, it is quite limited in functionality. For example, it doesn't provide the ability to draw a box quickly and easily on the screenshot.

There are heaps of great tools that provide much more advanced functionality. The best free tool is [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/)

The gold standard is a paid tool called Snagit. Snagit gives you the ultimate screenshot editing experience.
