Often when building systems it isn't super clear what all the nuts and bolts should be. There might be several major stakeholders each with slightly different ideas. 

[Event Storming](https://www.eventstorming.com/) is a way to centralize, collate and document everyone's viewpoints.

To start Event Storming get all stakeholders into a room or meeting and hand out sticky notes + pens. Then get everyone to write out all events they think are necessary and put the sticky notes on the wall. Alternatively, an online platform like [Miro](https://miro.com/) could be used to do it virtually.

### Scenario - Invoicing

Bob, Linda and Sam all sit down together to figure out their new invoicing system. Some of the events they might all come up with include:

* Create Invoice
* Delete Invoice
* Update Invoice
* Pay Invoice
* Print Invoice
* and many more...
