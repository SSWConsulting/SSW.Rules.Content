<span class='intro'> <p>
          Communicating problems is more effective when using screenshots. To make screen captures even 
          better, add balloons that have the message (aka speech bubbles). The balloon is great because 
          you can point to a specific part of the image. It is much easier than reading a 'wall of text'.
