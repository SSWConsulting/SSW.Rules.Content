<span class='intro'> <p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Many businesses have made the transition to working from home (WFH). It’s important to still be able to easily and clearly communicate with your colleagues and externals.&#160;​<br></p> </span>

<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​Without a spare room, it can be difficult to create a workable setup, however as you will see in the following examples, it is easy to create a clean and workable setup with a few smart tricks.​​<br></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Tip 1&#58; Use a room divider​​<br></h3><dl class="image"><dt>

   </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Jason is in a bedroom, however, the angle shows little of the bed</dd></dl><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">In this setup, Jason is using a more ‘pro’ setup with a USB powered podcasting mic and an articulating arm. He is also using a high-quality webcam with a ring light.​<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Originally the shot was more head-on, which meant you could see the bed in full view, however by moving the webcam off to the side and using the blinds, we can get a more pleasant looking shot.​​<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">For remote video recordings and User Groups, this is an ideal setup.​​<br></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Tip 3&#58; Get awesome audio​​<br></h3><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">One of the most frustrating aspects of remote calls is participants’ mixed audio quality.
