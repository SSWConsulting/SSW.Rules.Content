<span class='intro'> <p>When you go to meetings to attract business, you always walk in knowing what they want. Why should phone calls be any different?</p><p>We use an inbound calls script. Having an inbound script does a couple of great things for you. It allows you to control the flow of the conversation, it also makes sure that you're asking them the right questions, and most importantly, you know when to listen and take notes. When someone calls​ always have an email open to jot down notes as well as a solid set of probing questions ready to ask the prospect.​<br></p> </span>
