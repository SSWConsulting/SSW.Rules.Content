Once you have created your issue (request) and you remain the [Reporter](/Pages/ReportesAndAssignees.aspx), there are several ways you can track them, the most important is via your [Dashboard](/Pages/TrackingRequests.aspx) ; see how to intepret your dashboard [here](/Pages/SystemDashboard.aspx).   
<!--endintro-->

 Other ways are:

* using the filter [My Reported Unresolved Issues](/Pages/TrackingRequests.aspx)
* for SysAdmin using the filter [SysAdmin Unresolved](/Pages/TrackingRequests.aspx) shows where your request is in the queue
* placing shared filters in your favouries with [Manage Filters](/Pages/TrackingRequests.aspx)
* creating your own filters and sharing them, do this with a [Find Issues](/Pages/TrackingRequests.aspx)and then save it as a filter and share it
* make shared dashboards your favourites and create new ones with [Manage Dashboards](/Pages/TrackingRequests.aspx)
