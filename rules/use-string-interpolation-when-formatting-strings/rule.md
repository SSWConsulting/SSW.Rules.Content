String Interpolation - greatly reduces the amount of boilerplate code required when working with strings
Formatting strings on the fly was previously a task which required a stack of boilerplate code

<!--endintro-->



```
var s = String.Format("Profit is ${0} this year", p.TotalEarnings - p.Totalcost);
```




::: bad
Figure: Bad Example - Using String.Format() makes the code difficult to read

:::



```
var s = "Profit is ${p.TotalEarnings - p.Totalcost} this year";
```




::: good
Figure: Good Example - String Interpolation is very human readable
