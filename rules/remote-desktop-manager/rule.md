To manage multiple servers and group of domain joined computers remotely, it would be a pain for a System Administrator to use Microsoft Remote desktop connection application inbuilt in Windows https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/how-to-use-remote-desktop-5fe128d5-8fb1-7a23-3b8a-41e636865e8c

### Drawbacks of Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection

* Remote Desktop Services currently does not support multiple monitors on the terminal server.
* The GUI interface is outdated
* Remote Desktop Services should provide an option to scale up or down the screen size after a connection is established. Currently you can only adjust the screen size prior to a connection is established.
* Remote Desktop Services does not have a menu to send special key strokes like Ctrl+Alt+Del to the terminal server.Â
