**My Site** and **My Profile<** are great but if you are not using them, it makes sense to remove them:

<!--endintro-->

![Figure: Links need to be hidden](LinksNeedToBeRemove.png)

You can follow below steps to hide “My Site” and “My Profile”. There are a few options, based on what you need to do:

### Delete the association (not recommended)

1. Going to **Central Admin | Application Management | Service Applications | Configure service application associations**, and choose “default” link:

::: bad

:::

2. Uncheck the “User Profile Service Application” in the opened page, then click “OK”:

::: bad

### Customize permissions for only some people to have access to create personal site

You can remove it for most people - but leave it for only some users.

1. Go to **Central Admin | Application Management | Service Applications | Manage service applications**, and click the link of “User Profile Service Application”, navigate to its manage page:

::: ok
![Figure: OK example - “User Profile Service Application” manage page](UserProfileServiceManagePage.png)
:::

2. Click **People | Manage User Permissions**, you can customize the user profile permission for specific users:

::: ok

:::

### Delete the service (recommended if you don't need the service at all in your farm)

**Note:** You can always create it later if you need it in the future.

1. Go to **Central Admin | Application Management | Service Applications | Manage service applications**, and select “User Profile Service Application”, then click the “Delete” button on the ribbon:

::: good

::: greybox
**Note:** Later on if you want to get My Site working read these 2 links... unless Microsoft creates a services that fixes User Profile Synchronization service. Thanks to Mark Rhodes for these tips:
