After the database has finished being attached to the web application you will get a log file with information about the import process.

1. Open up this log fine and pay special attention to any lines with  **[ERROR]** . 

    Note #1: The most common reason for errors is that you have forgotten to activate a feature.

    Note #2: If you have your own custom solutions, show this file to your developers to ensure it isnâ€™t your custom solution causing the errors.
2. Check your Application Event log after migration for errors related to your SharePoint Web Application, and fix these accordingly.
