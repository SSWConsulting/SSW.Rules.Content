<span class='intro'> 
  <p>After the database has finished being attached to the web application you will get a log file with information about the import process. </p>
<ol>
    <li>Open up this log fine and pay special attention to any lines with <b>[ERROR]</b>. <br>
    Note #1&#58; The most common reason for errors is that you have forgotten to activate a feature.<br>
    Note #2&#58; If you have your own custom solutions, show this file to your developers to ensure it isnâ€™t your custom solution causing the errors.</li>
    <li>Check your Application Event log after migration for errors related to your SharePoint Web Application, and fix these accordingly.</li>
</ol>
