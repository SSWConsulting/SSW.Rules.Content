If you are using Microsoft Dynamics 365 Online as your CRM solution, you might have noticed that it syncs some Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) fields automatically.

<!--endintro-->

Dynamics 365 Online leverages Azure AD fields to import information to users, e.g.:

1. First Name;
2. Last Name;
3. Job Title;
4. Address


And, depending on your configuration, these Azure AD fields might be coming directly from on-premises Active Directory (AD), which means that any changes made in AD will go through all the way to Dynamics 365 Online!

That also means that if you change a field in Dynamics 365 directly, that might get overwritten by the value in Azure AD in the next sync (usually every 15-30 minutes), so make sure you make that field read-only so users are not led to error.

Recommended fields to keep as read-only in Dynamics 365:

1. User Name;
2. Title (Job Title);
3. Address


You can find more information on official Microsoft documentation:     [Azure active directory attributes that are synced to Dynamics 365 / CDS](https&#58;//community.dynamics.com/crm/f/microsoft-dynamics-crm-forum/386022/info-azure-active-directory-attributes-that-are-synced-to-dynamics-365-cds).
