Nowadays there are a variety of online video hosting solutions to choose from and it's important you pick the right service for the right purpose.

YouTube is great for exposure, social media sharing and where user engagement is part of your marketing strategy. The best types of content that work on YouTube are Educational and Entertainment.

However, YouTube might not be the best place to host your more marketing based videos, for example, a homepage video selling a service or product.

Hosting platforms like Wistia and Vimeo is better for professional purposes because they can offer things like higher video quality, embedded player customization, improved analytics, external links and capture forms - great for selling a product or service.
