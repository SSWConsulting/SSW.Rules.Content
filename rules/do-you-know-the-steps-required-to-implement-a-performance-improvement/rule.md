<span class='intro'> The following steps will help to guide efforts to implement a performance improvement. The key is to only make a&#160;small&#160;change with each iteration and run a performance test to ensure that change resulted in an improvement.<br> </span>

<p>​<br></p><ol><li>Establish a performance target (goal posts)</li><li>Build an automated performance test</li><li>Run the performance test to establish a baseline (the current performance data)</li><li>Make a&#160;<em>small&#160;</em>change to the process</li><li>Run the performance test again to measure the impact of the single improvement against the baseline</li><li>If the change results in a measurable performance improvement, then keep it</li><li>Repeat steps 4 to 6 until the performance target has been met</li></ol><p><br>For <b>bonus points</b> when you're ready to deploy to production&#58;<br><br></p><ol><li>Run the performance test against production to establish a production baseline</li><li>Deploy the changes to production</li><li>Run the performance test to measure the impact of the improvements</li><li>Provide the performance improvement results to your product owner and bask in the shower of compliments coming your way for a job well done!<br></li></ol><div><font color="#333333"><br></font></div><p>​Working against a baseline and having a defined target will ensure that you are not prematurely or over optimising your process.<br><br></p>
