1. ~~If your app is built on Silverlight today.~~ Stop building things on Silverlight today.

2. Reasons are:

    * Time to market
    * Lower cost
    * Reuse MVVM
    * Reuse Silverlight controls
    * Reuse the Business and Data layer
3. The Biggest thing going for windows phone is:

    * .NET dev shops
    * Environment more productive than xcode

    Note: WP7 is built on Silverlight 3 (not Silverlight 4)
    Note: WP7 was built by a 'web team' not "Rich client app team', so some issues exist:

    * Bing map control relies on host page (authentication)
    * Avoid using System.Windows.Browser.dll in your Silverlight App (as it works only
                        OOB on desktop) and you will have to use a different control on Windows Phone 7
4. Others reasons are:
    * You can deploy your app without going through the appstore/market place. E.g. my
                    SSW business app


| Appstore:
                         |                             No
                         |

| Market place:
                         |                             Yes
                         |
    * Turn around through the appstore is quicker:
                

| Appstore:
                         |                             1-3 weeks
                         |

| Market place:
                         |                             2 days (Quicker since it is managed code. Unmanaged code is easy to spot)
                         |
    * App store is blocking applications MS won't.
