<span class='intro'> ​Do you have trouble finding amazing developers?!&#160;Here is how we do it!<br><div><br></div> </span>

<p>​​At SSW we do not use recruiters, instead we rely on word of mouth for&#160;referrals, or we advertise a position using&#160;LinkedIn. We find that&#160;the filters on LinkedIn are a good way of attracting people with the correct&#160;skills. You can choose up to 10 skills per ad, saving you a lot of time.<br></p><p>We also try to make our ads interesting and fun to help them stand out. For example, when we needed a new State Manager for Brisbane, we needed someone with a Business mind, who also&#160;knew our industry inside and out. So&#160;we created&#160;the title &quot;A Business Guy (once a wannabe developer)&quot;. This got people's attention, and got us the right person for the job!<br></p><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><img src="./Business%20Guy.png" alt="Business Guy.png" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;750px;height&#58;680px;" />​&#160;​​​</dl><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Fi​g​ure&#58; Good example - Our &quot;Business Guy&quot; role as show​n on our website.<br></dd><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><br></dl><p>Once we have our candidates,&#160;we call them for a chat, put them through a communications challenge, and then a coding challenge. This ensures that we find people who are the right cultural fit for our company, as well as a kick arse consultant and&#160;coder.<br></p><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><img src="./Recruitmentbright.jpg" alt="Recruitmentbright.jpg" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;600px;height&#58;523px;" /></dl><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureNormal">Image&#58; SSW's recruitment process.<br></dd><p><br></p>
