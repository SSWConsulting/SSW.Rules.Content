<h4>Why do we call it &quot;banana rule&quot;?</h4><p>
                    How would you get a monkey pay attention to something? You could lure him by tempting
                    him with a banana. Once we have the monkeys attention focused on the banana, he
                    will try to get his hands on it regardless of the barriers on his way.</p><dl class="image"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/banana.jpg" alt="Getting attention of monkey with banana" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; If the monkey can see the banana, he will do whatever it takes to get it</dd></dl><p>This is how the &quot;banana rule&quot; should be applied&#58;</p><dl class="badImage"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/BadBananaQantas.png" alt="Bad use of banana in Qantas.com.au" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Bad Example – &quot;Points+Pay&quot;button takes the attention over &quot;Go&quot;​&#160;which should be the &quot;banana&quot;</dd></dl><span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">So, remember most pages need a &quot;banana&quot; to get them to where you want them. &quot;Bananas&quot; are big, simple and stand out from the rest of the page</span><dl class="goodImage"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/BananaTeamviewer.png" alt="Good use of banana in Teamviewer.com" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Great Example - Team Viewer also has a good banana</dd></dl>
