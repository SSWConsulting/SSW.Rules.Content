You should use OneNote instead of the default Wiki. This way you can use it offline on your mobile apps.

![Bad Example: Default tab – Wiki. There is no offline mobile application](teams-best-wiki-1.jpg)

::: good  
![Good Example: Use OneNote. Now you can use the normal OneNote Desktop and Mobile app for iOS and Android (including offline support)](teams-best-wiki-2.jpg)

**Note:** Rename the tab to show that it is a OneNote Tab. E.g.: " **OneNote - SSW Reno Sydney** "
