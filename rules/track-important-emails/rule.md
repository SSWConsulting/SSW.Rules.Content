<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​​Whenever you email a client with a correspondence that relates to an existing CRM opportunity (i.e. an "as per our conversation" about when you think the project would get going etc.) you should track it in CRM so it is centralized and can be seen by anyone else who tries to follow up that opportunity.<span style="color:#444444;">​</span></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
 <p>
          The simplest way is when writing or receiving the email, in Outlook click the Dynamics 365 CRM
          button and then ​"Track without Regarding" to the opportunity in question.<br></p>
