By now, you‚Äôve probably realised that you can ask ChatGPT to create content for a PPT, which you can then copy and paste into PowerPoint, but this is still time consuming. The next level is to get it to then create the VBA script that can be run to generate the whole PPT üòÄ

Here‚Äôs a great prompt template for doing both! Feel free to play around with things like the preferred format or title colours.
