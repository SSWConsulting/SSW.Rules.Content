General web content should always be written as if read by a newsreader. It is objective and describes its content professionally. A good example of this is Wikipedia.

                            jQuery is superior to JavaScript for this because...<br>:::<br><br>&lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure&#58; Good Example - using 3rd person writing makes it sound like fact</dd></dl>
However, when quoting a testimonial, you should use 1st person writing as if a newsreader had crossed over to an eyewitness for a personal view of the topic.
<dl class="badImage">&lt;dt&gt;<br><br>::: greybox<br>
                            Don Bradman thought that SSW's work was fantastic!<br>:::<br><br>&lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure&#58; Bad Example - impersonal</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage">&lt;dt&gt;<br><br>::: greybox<br>
                            Don Bradman says&#58; &quot;I thought that SSW's work was fantastic!&quot;<br>:::<br><br>&lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure&#58; Good Example - 1st person in this context is appropriate</dd></dl>
