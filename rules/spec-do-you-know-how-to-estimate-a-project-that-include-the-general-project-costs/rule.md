  <p>​Estimates&#160;contain two main classes of work&#58; Work&#160;relating to the particular product (e.g. Create Customers.aspx) and work relating to the project as a whole&#160;(e.g. management, administration, testing, software audit etc.). <br></p>
<p>PBIs may&#160;only make up about&#160;60% of the total project time. Project Managers and developers should not think that the only work being charged on a project are coding tasks.<br></p>

  <p>
    <strong>General Project Costs <br>
</strong>Management costs can change depending on how much management the client requires. You should&#160;recommend a suitable level of management. 'Management,&#160;accountability and transparency' has a cost. </p>
<p>You should add general project costs as a % of the work items generally in line with the following (note that these numbers are just best guesses)&#58;<br></p><ul>
    <li>​Testing&#58; 20%​<br></li><li>Bug Fixes&#58; 20%<br></li>
    <li>Software Audit (if relevant)&#58; 4 hours per Release - usually conducted by two experienced Architects </li>
    <li>Fixes from the Software Audit&#58; 5% </li>
    <li>DevOps&#58; 10%<br></li><li>Project Management&#58; 15% - this includes items like stand up meetings, timesheets, standard updates, reviews, etc.<br></li>
    <li>Unknowns (for risky projects)&#58; 10%. While this is arbitrary it raises awareness for everybody ​that 'there are things we still don't know!'<br></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Project Specific Costs </strong></p>
<p>Estimates for a project should&#160;be done by a developer, checked by another developer, and finally triple checked by an Account&#160;Manager. While every project is different in some way, there are common elements.&#160;<br></p><p>SSW has built an estimates calculator to assist in cre​ating estimates.&#160;<span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">See the </span><a href="https&#58;//projects.ssw.com.au/Templates/Forms/AllItems.aspx" style="line-height&#58;1.6;">Estimates Calculator</a>&#160;here.<br></p>
<p>​If the client requires a fixed price quotation, a 20% premium is added to the estimates for the sprints&#160;specified in the Specification Release only (i.e. a fixed price is not given on the entire project). Requests for variations to a fixed price contract must wait until the contract is completed. If development is based on a fixed price contract, work is completed offsite only to facilitate project management and prevent unauthorized scope development.​ </p>
<p>Note&#58;&#160;A suggestion for Microsoft&#58;&#160;It would be great if TFS&#160;had functionality to&#160;“Add <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/BetterSoftwareSuggestions/TeamFoundationServer.aspx#StandardItems">Standard Items </a>to a Sprint”​ </p>
