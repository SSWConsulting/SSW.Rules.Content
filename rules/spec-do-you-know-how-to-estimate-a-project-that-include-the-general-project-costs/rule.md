Estimates contain 2 main classes of work:

- Relating to the particular product (e.g. create page 'customers.aspx')
- Relating to the project as a whole (e.g. management, administration, testing, software audit etc.).

PBIs may only make up about 60% of the total project time. Project Managers and developers should not think that the only work being charged on a project are coding tasks.

### General Project Costs

Management costs can change depending on how much management the client requires. You should recommend a suitable level of management. 'Management, accountability and transparency' has a cost.

You should add general project costs as a % of the work items generally in line with the following (note that these numbers are just best guesses):

- Testing: 20%
- Bug Fixes: 20%
- Software Audit (if relevant): 4 hours per Release - usually conducted by two experienced Architects
- Fixes from the Software Audit: 5%
- DevOps: 10%
- Project Management: 15% - this includes items like stand up meetings, timesheets, standard updates, reviews, etc.
- Unknowns (for risky projects): 10%. While this is arbitrary it raises awareness for everybody that **there are things we still don't know!**

### Project Specific Costs

Estimates for a project should be done by a developer, checked by another developer, and finally triple checked by an Account Manager. While every project is different in some way, there are common elements.

::: info
SSW has built an estimates calculator to assist in creating estimates. See the [Estimates Calculator](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Rules.Content/raw/main/rules/spec-do-you-know-how-to-estimate-a-project-that-include-the-general-project-costs/4.%20Estimates%20Calculator.xlsx) here.
:::

If the client requires a fixed price quotation, a 20% premium is added to the estimates for the Sprints specified in the Specification Release only (i.e. a fixed price is not given on the entire project). Requests for variations to a fixed price contract must wait until the contract is completed. If development is based on a fixed price contract, work is completed offsite only to facilitate project management and prevent unauthorized scope development.

**Note:** A suggestion for Microsoft - It would be great if Azure DevOps had functionality to “Add Standard Items" to a Sprint.
