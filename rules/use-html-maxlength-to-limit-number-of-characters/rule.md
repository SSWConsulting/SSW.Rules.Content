**Rule 1: ** Whenever you have a data entry page you should always use the html maxlength attribute to limit number of characters to the length of the field in the table (except for numbers).

**Rule 2:**  Whenever you have a situation where you are using the HTML textarea (does not have the maxlength property)

<!--endintro-->

Then you need to:

* add the JavaScript function eg. ValidateLength(control)
* add 2 properties to every data control  eg. dataType="char" onkeyup="validateLength(this)"
