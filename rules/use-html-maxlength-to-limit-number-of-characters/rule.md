**Rule 1:** Whenever you have a data entry page you should always use the HTML `maxlength` attribute to limit number of characters to the length of the field in the table (except for numbers).

**Rule 2:** Whenever you have a situation where you are usingÂ the HTML `textarea` (does not have the `maxlength` property).

Then you need to:

- Add the JavaScript function. E.g. `ValidateLength(control)`
- Add 2 properties to every data control. E.g. `dataType="char" onkeyup="validateLength(this)"`
