Emails that are automatically generated can quickly overload your inbox with less important message (E.g. Teams message, github, Azure Devops and etc)

You can create a folder and rules in your outlook to store noise email from each sender. [Move message from specific sender](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/always-move-messages-from-a-specific-sender-e28d03c0-077d-4366-a348-4536f0fc9008)
