It’s common to send emails to a team and ask them to do a task, but usually that is not a good idea. They may all assume that someone else will do the task or reply. 
 
As the old quote goes: “If everyone is in charge of something, no one is!”

It’s generally a better idea to direct each email/task to one specific person.

The only exception to this would be if you have a ticketing system, like Zendesk, that automatically adds emails to a backlog, and you have a generic task that could be completed by anyone.
