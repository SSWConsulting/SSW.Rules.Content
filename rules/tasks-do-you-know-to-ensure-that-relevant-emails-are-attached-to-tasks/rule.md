Often you will receive rich information from your Product Owner (customer) about tasks. That information can be in the form of Word documents, but you generally receive them in the context of an email. This should be done by one person called the **scribe**.

<!--endintro-->

### The scribe will:

1. Take screenshots and notes
2. Turn them into multiple emails
3. Add them into Azure DevOps (**Note:** You can't do this in GitHub)

You need to keep these so your team can refer to it later, and so you can send a “Done” when the task has been completed. This preserves the history of the task and allows you to keep relevant parties included in any future conversation.

Keep the original email so that you can [reply "Done" and delete the email](/dones-do-you-reply-done-and-delete-the-original-email).

**More information**

You should follow the existing [Rules to Successful Projects](/rules-to-successful-projects) and attach the email to your task so you can refer to and reply to it later when you close the task:

- [Do you know what Outlook add-ins you need?](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/standards/rules/RulesToBetterProjectManagementWithTFS.aspx#OutlookAddin)
- [Describe the work item request in an email](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/standards/rules/RulesToBetterProjectManagementWithTFS.aspx#WorkItemEmail)
- [Use Outlook Add-in to move the email to a Work Item](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/standards/rules/RulesToBetterProjectManagementWithTFS.aspx#TeamCompanionWorkItem)

Following these simple rules will help your Product Owner understand you better, and allow your team to more effectively collaborate with each other.

An added bonus is that as we are keeping the email history in sync with Azure DevOps. When you “reply all” to the email all of the interested parties to the Task are also included. This notifies those that may have been blocked by your task to keep up to date with its status.
