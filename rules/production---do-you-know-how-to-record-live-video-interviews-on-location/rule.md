<p>Recording live video interviews on location can be difficult. The key to success is to make the process as simple as possible, so you continue to record and release interviews. </p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>A good example of an effective but easy to record interview is&#58;</p>

<br><div class="ms-rtestate-read ms-rte-wpbox"><div id="div_bc344b9a-3339-455e-a31a-59740e1bfd60" class="ms-rtestate-notify  ms-rtestate-read bc344b9a-3339-455e-a31a-59740e1bfd60"></div>
<div id="vid_bc344b9a-3339-455e-a31a-59740e1bfd60" style="display&#58;none;"></div></div>

<br>
<p>Here are a few tips to simplify the process&#58;</p>
<ol>
<li>The interviewer should hold the camera and interview the subject at the same time</li>
<li>Keep a tight frame. Don’t have lots of empty space around the subject</li>
<li>Use the rule of thirds. See&#58;</li>
<div class="ms-rtestate-read ms-rte-wpbox"><div class="ms-rtestate-notify  ms-rtestate-read 36ad5df3-a588-4bea-836f-49ce977e5085" id="div_36ad5df3-a588-4bea-836f-49ce977e5085"></div>
<div id="vid_36ad5df3-a588-4bea-836f-49ce977e5085" style="display&#58;none;"></div></div>

<li>Don't zoom erratically – Ease in and ease out of zooms</li>
<li>If someone starts speaking off camera, move to them slowly and smoothly without rushing (it is OK for them to talk off camera for a short time)</li>
<li>To record both voices use a single shotgun microphone for both interviewer and subject</li>

</ol>
