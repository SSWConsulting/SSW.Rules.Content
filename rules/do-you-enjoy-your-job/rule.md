Long term success in a career requires:

* First is to put your heart into your job and enjoy yourself
* Get your responsibilities done
* Improve your company to become a better place every week
* Improve yourself to become a better person every week


<!--endintro-->

If you find yourself not enjoying your job, this is not necessarily a bad thing. You should make a commitment to give it a go and try to make it work. When you have decided you are unhappy, you should talk to your boss and figure out what is making you unhappy.

The number 1 cause of stress in this industry is caused by running out of budget for a project. The best way to handle this is to give realistic estimates, and inform the clients as soon as it looks like they will be exceeded. A client who has accepted the realities of his project is less scary than working on code that's already over-budget with an impending unknown client reaction.
