                    If you find yourself not enjoying your job this is not necessarily a bad thing.
                    You should make a commitment to give it a go and try to make it work. When you have
                    decided you are unhappy you should talk to your boss and figure out what is making
                    you unhappy. The fact is that there are some jobs that you are not suited to. It
                    is probably best for everyone that you start to think about moving on and trying
                    something that may make you happier.

                    The number 1 cause of stress in this industry is caused by impending budgets. The
                    best way to handle this is to give realistic estimates, and imform the clients as
                    soon as it looks like they will be exceeded. A client who has accepted the realities
                    of his project is less scary than working on code that's already over-budget with
                    an impending unknown client reaction.
