                    If you find yourself not enjoying your job, this is not necessarily a bad thing.
                    You should make a commitment to give it a go and try to make it work. When you have
                    decided you are unhappy, you should talk to your boss and figure out what is making
                    you unhappy. </p><p><span style="line-height:1.6;">The number 1 cause of stress in this industry is ca</span><span style="line-height:1.6;">used by running out of budget for a project. The
                    best way to handle this is</span><span style="line-height:1.6;"> to give realistic estimates, and inform the clients as
                    soon as it looks like they will be exceeded. A client who has accepted the realities
                    of his project is less scary than working on code that's already over-budget with
                    an impending unknown client reaction.​</span></p><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><img src="Richard-Branson_Picture-Quote.jpg" alt="Richard-Branson_Picture-Quote.jpg" style="margin:5px;" /><br></dl><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea">​​<span style="color:#555555;font-size:11px;font-weight:bold;">​​Figure: It's possible to REALLY enjoy your job</span></dl>
