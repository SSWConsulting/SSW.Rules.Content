## Improve your vocal tone

To ensure your tone matches your intent, try these steps:

1. During your next call, record your voice
2. Reflect - Listen to the recording and ask yourself:

* Emotion - Does your tone convey the emotion you intended?
* Exciting - Are you speaking with enough energy and enthusiasm?
* Engaging - Does your voice sound engaging and confident?

If you do this for a while, you will start to notice patterns in your tone and be able to adjust it in realtime.

You can also improve your tone by watching a good speaker and trying to mimic their tone.

## Speak with certainty

Avoid "upspeaking" â€” a rising intonation at the end of your statements. This habit can make your statements sound like questions,  reducing your perceived confidence and authority.  
Instead, aim to finish your sentences with a neutral or downward inflection to project certainty and credibility.
