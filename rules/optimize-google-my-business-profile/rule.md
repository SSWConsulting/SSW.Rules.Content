It’s important to keep all information about your business online up to date. The easiest way is to review your current Google My Business listing and optimize the data to ensure your clients (or potential clients) can still find you - even if you need to change your phone number or move to a new address.

<!--endintro-->

Follow this checklist to make sure you have everything covered:

1. Business name – make sure it's consistent with your website and social media ([Do you know the value of consistency?](/the-value-of-consistency))
2. Address – correct street number and suite number, if needed
3. Phone – is number the same one you have on your website?
4. Hours - add the correct ones.
   * Public holidays - update them at the beginning of every year. Can you imagine a client showing up to a closed business?
5. Business description and category – add this information to help attract potential customers
6. Customer reviews – whether you get good or bad reviews, make sure you reply to them.
   * If there was a problem, try to understand the situation and help them.
   * If you received a glowing review, say thanks!
7. Products/services – in this description field, use SEO keywords that people usually use to look for the product/service. This will make your profile more ‘[Googable](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=googable)’.
8. Photos - upload cool and real photos of your business.
   * Front and inside of your business
   * Your team
   * Events
   * Specific shots e.g. your menu if you own a restaurant.
9. Posting feature – if you want to share a new service you are offering or hosting an event, you can use this feature to communicate it to your customers.
