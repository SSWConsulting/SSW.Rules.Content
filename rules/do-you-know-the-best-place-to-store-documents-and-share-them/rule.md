As an added bonus thanks to this; you can take the files offline by syncing with OneDrive for Business and by default each channel gets its own folder.<br></p><dl class="goodImage"><dt>

   <b>Note&#58;</b> You can add other cloud storage providers for file storage&#160;e.g. Google Drive, Dropbox, etc 
   <br>This is not recommended - as they aren't first-class​ citizens i.e. if you want to share files from them, you need to go to the provider's sharing settings outside of Teams</p> 
<br> 
<p class="ssw15-rteElement-InfoBox"> 
   <b>Warning&#58;</b> By using Teams instead of SharePoint, you are losing a number of key features&#58;<br><span style="background-color&#58;initial;">- No full fidelity support for Metadata in Document Libraries e.g. can’t add extra columns into the “Files” tab<br>-&#160;</span><span style="background-color&#58;initial;">No support for private channels e.g. you will need a team per subset of users with different permissions<br>-&#160;</span><span style="background-color&#58;initial;">No direct access to version history from Teams UI (still exists on SharePoint UI)<br>-&#160;</span><span style="background-color&#58;initial;">No access to the cross-office365 Search feature e.g. SharePoint search is better (see video&#58;
