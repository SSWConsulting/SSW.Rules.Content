Electronic communication can easily cause misunderstandings. Help the reader understand your message better by:

* Keeping the prior email in your reply
* When quoting text from someone else (e.g. The original email you are replying to, a web page, etc.), use the “&gt;” and indentation. Your new text should be kept to the left. When quoting text on web pages, always include a link to the web page.
* Add numbers if the sender didn't
* Optionally, use a different text color in your reply

This way you won't forget any questions in the original email.

**Note:** For those using mobile devices the indentation function is not available, try instead using 3 spaces to indent manually.
