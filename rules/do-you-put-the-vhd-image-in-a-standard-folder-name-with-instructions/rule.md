  <p>When you do a lot of presenting on your laptop it is good to have a standard location to keep your VHD and instructions.&#160;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Give the VHD the name of what the demo is for and a version number for the image.<br>
    <strong>Example&#58;&#160;</strong>SharePoint2010_v2.vhd </li>
    <li>Use “RC” or “Beta” on the filename if your software is an RC or Beta Version<br>
    <strong>Example&#58; </strong>SharePoint2010RC_v1.vhd </li>
    <li>Store the VHD Image in a folder called DataVMs\VHDName\VHDName.vhd<br>
    <strong>Example&#58; </strong>D&#58;\DataVMs\SharePoint2010_v2 \SharePoint2010_v2.vhd </li>
    <li>Keep an instructions.txt in the same folder as the VHD with any instructions for the VHD and the username and password to log into the VHD.<br>
    <strong>Example&#58; </strong>D&#58;\DataVMs\SharePoint2010_v2 \instructions.txt </li>
</ul>
