<span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureBad">Figure&#58; Bad Example - Appointments should have addresses in location when appropriate </span>

<img class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" alt="Good location" src="/PublishingImages/appointment-location-good-example.jpg" />
<span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureGood">Figure&#58; Good Example - Address is clearly identified in the location field, meaning this can easily be used by mapping applications on smartphones</span>

<p>It's important to always add the address information in appointments when a third party is included. ie&#58;<br></p>
<ul>
<li>A client meeting at your location</li>
<li>A meeting at the client location</li>
</ul>
<p>The exception is for internal meeting appointments&#58;</p>
