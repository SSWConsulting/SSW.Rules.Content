Keeping a breadcrumb trail on every page is necessary. It is a navigation tool so users can easily locate themselves and find what they are looking for quickly. But don't [link a page to itself!](/do-you-avoid-linking-a-page-to-itself/)

Integrating a breadcrumb trail on webpages brings these benefits:

<!--endintro-->

* provides users with a clear and visual navigational path - they understand their location within the website's structure
* enhanced user navigation
* easy to backtrack to previous pages and explore related content
* reduced effort required to navigate through complex websites
* allows users to quickly access information - more engagement
* improves overall website usability

Additionally, breadcrumbs contribute to better search engine optimization, as they provide search engines with a clear understanding of the website's hierarchy, helping to improve website visibility and rankings in search results.
