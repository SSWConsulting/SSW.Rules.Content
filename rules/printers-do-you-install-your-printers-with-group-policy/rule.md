It is important install your printers automatically to all clients that logon to the domain.

<!--endintro-->

This can be achieved via Group Policy. This can be set up easily in a Microsoft Windows 2008 Server R2:


::: greybox
 **Note:** It is better to deploy printers via GPO preferences to end users and also for large-scale environments. There are third-party products eg. Tricerat or Printer Logic which makes centralizing printer queues and servers more efficiently.

:::

* From Server Manager add the Print Services role
![Install the Print Services role](install-print-roles.jpg)**Figure: Install the Print Services role*** When the role has installed, open Print Management from Administrative Tools
* Install all your printers by right clicking on Printers and clicking Add Printer
![Add all of your printers to the server](add-printers.jpg)**Figure: Add all of your printers to the server*** Right click on Drivers and choose Add Drivers. From here you will be able to install the x86 and x64 drivers for your printers so all workstations in your organization get the printer drives automatically
![Add the additional drivers for both x86 and x64](add-drivers.jpg)**Figure: Add the additional drivers for both x86 and x64*** Click on Printers in the menu to get a list of your installed printers
