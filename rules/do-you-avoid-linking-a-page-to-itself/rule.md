<span class='intro'> <p>If you have a link on a page that takes you back to the same page, then 
that is a weird experience. So don't include a link to the very page you
 are on.</p> </span>

<p>Exceptions are&#58;</p><ul><li>Permalink – Because it enables a user to get a link to the current page or bookmark.</li><li>Logo on the homepage – It’s widely known that clicking on the logo will take you to the homepage and it shouldn’t change if you are already on the homepage. People often click on it to reload the page.</li><li>Menu items – However you should visually indicate on what page you are on. </li></ul>
