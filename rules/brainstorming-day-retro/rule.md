The results of the Brainstorming day can have a great impact on the company. It's important to get everyone's thoughts on each idea.

2. ✅ What went well?
3. ❌ What didn't go so well?
4. 💡 Any ideas to improve it?
5. {{IDEA NAME}} - How good was the outcome of the Brainstorming session?
   * Rating /10
   * In the question, Include a link to the GitHub Discussion and YouTube video of the presentation
6. {{IDEA NAME}} - Which option/s should we do?
   * This should be a multiple-choice question with all the options pitched in the presentation
   * Depending on the options pitched, this question might need to allow multiple answers

Repeat questions 5 and 6 for each idea.

This should be done on the Friday after the Brainstorming day.
