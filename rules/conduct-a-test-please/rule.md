**Test, test, test!** Testing is the most critical part of any project. You should get another set of eyes to check the work (aka conduct a "Test Please") before delivering the feature. This ensures the clients has a great experience when receiving a quality application with confidence that it performs as expected.

**Does the "Test Please" principle apply to more than code?**

Yes! A "Test Please" applies to everything. We always want a second pair of eyes to catch unseen errors!

### Developer responsibilities





1. Once you have implemented the PBI, prepare a "Test Please" email. Create the email by copying the text from the sample [Test Please Template](/request-a-test-please).
2. Find at least one tester to test your app. Some teams don't have dedicated testers, so you can designate another developer on the team as a tester. 
3. Include a link to the specific GitHub Issue / Azure DevOps PBI so that the tester knows the [Acceptance Criteria](/acceptance-criteria) to test.
4. [Triage](/triaging-do-you-correctly-triage-additional-item-requests/) any bug/suggestion emails from the testers
5. Make sure that the testers know which build they are testing. The developers may be 3 builds ahead of the testers, but they need to complete a test run on an individual build to make sure that bugs are fixed and that there are no regressions.

    **Note:** Having a good branching strategy and using [ephemeral environments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KrodXD3lPc) makes testing a feature easy and have confidence in the outcome before allowing the code to be committed to `origin/main`. This protects your `origin/main` branch from contamination by code that does not work.

6. When you receive a "Test Pass" from both testers (and never before), [close the issue with the necessary context](/close-pbis-with-context)
   
7. Your [Definition of Done](/definition-of-done/) usually would include a requirement to get acceptance from the Product Owner / Client, so make sure you do that before closing the issue 

9. Prepare a "Test Please" email with a [Done Video](/record-a-quick-and-dirty-done-video) to the original feature request email (typically sent by the **Client** or **Product Owner**).

  **Note:** If you are requested to deploy an untested feature to a client's environment, use the [As per our conversation emails](/as-per-our-conversation-emails/) and [For the record](/for-the-record) rules and clearly state "Has not passed internal testing" in the email.

8. Wait for a test pass from the client
9. Now follow the DONE email rule

### Tester responsibilities

1. Test within the hour - testing is typically urgent.
2. Know what to test - check the Acceptance Criteria on the GitHub Issue / Azure DevOps PBI
3. Be thorough - report any major or minor bugs (remembering to report each [bug/suggestion](/report-bugs-and-suggestions/) in a separate email).
4. "Reply All" to the **original** Test Please request email for each bug or feature you report (to ensure that no issue is reported twice).
5. Specify how you replicated the bug through clear reproduction steps and screenshots.
6. When finished, reply to the "Test Please" email and include "Test Pass (as no critical bugs)" or "Test Failed (as per critical bugs reported)" at the top of the email.

### Hi Gary,

This was a good version but, unfortunately:

‚ùå **Test failed**
(as per critical bugs reported in other emails) 
`youtube: https://www.youtube.com/embed/whxbTtkH5GU` 

**Video: Test Failed! (10 sec)**
::: 
:::
::: good  
Figure: Good Example - This is how to reply failed to a "test please" email 
:::

**Note:** If the test to be performed is quick and the tester is available on the spot, consider using a "[checked by](/do-you-know-when-to-do-use-checked-by-xxx)" style instead to save some time.
