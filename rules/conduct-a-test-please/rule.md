**Test, test, test!** Testing is the most critical part of any project. You should get another set of eyes to check the work (aka conduct a "Test Please") before delivering the feature. This ensures the client has a great experience when receiving a quality application with confidence that it performs as expected.

**Does the "Test Please" principle apply to more than code?**

üëç Yes! You almost always want a "Test Please". We usually want a second pair of eyes to catch unseen errors! This isn't necessary for small changes, such as spelling mistakes.  
:::

## Coding

If you are writing code, your Pull Request (PR) review is your "Test Please"

**Tips:**

* You should do an [over the shoulder PR review](/over-the-shoulder)  
* Embrace proactive testing ‚Äì If you anticipate potential feedback on the User eXperience (UX) after your code is merged and deployed, ensure it is tested by a team member in the development environment. This will save tears when it reaches production

## Emails

If you are writing an email, a "[checked by](/checked-by-xxx)" is your "Test Please".

## Videos

If you created a video, ["Test Please" for videos](/test-please-for-video) "Test Please". After launch you may want to keep an eye on [likes and comments](/like-and-comment-on-videos) for further feedback.

## Anything else

If you are doing anything else (e.g. creating a new blog post, updating a Word document, or preparing a PowerPoint presentation), you should still get a 2nd set of eyes to check the work and document it somewhere. You can do that via a PBI (ideally) or email (if there is no backlog).

Figure: Good example - Sometimes it's good to soften the blow with some humour when you have to fail a "test please" email

**Note:** If the test to be performed is quick and the tester is available on the spot, consider using a "[checked by](/checked-by-xxx)" style instead to save some time.
