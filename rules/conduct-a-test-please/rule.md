**Test, test, test!** Testing is the most critical part of any project. You should get another set of eyes to check the work (aka conduct a "Test Please") before delivering the feature. This ensures the clients has a great experience when receiving a quality application with confidence that it performs as expected.

**Does the "Test Please" principle apply to more than code?**

Yes! you almost always want a "Test Please". We usually want a second pair of eyes to catch unseen errors! This isn't necessary for small changes e.g. spelling mistakes.  
:::

If you are writing code, your Pull Request (PR) is your "Test Please".  
Tip: You should do an [over the shoulder PR review](/over-the-shoulder-prs)

If you are writing an email, a [Checked By](/checked-by-xxx) is your "Test Please".

If you are doing anything else (e.g. updating a Word doc), you should still get a 2nd set of eyes to check the work and document it somewhere.
