LinkedIn Talent Hub is huge! So do you know the main features?

<!--endintro-->

LinkedIn Talent Hub brings LinkedIn Recruiter and Jobs together into a new ATS platform that lets you source, manage, and hire – all in one place. You can post a job and immediately source quality candidates using Recruiter in the same view, as well as keeping track of applicants and managing the hiring process in one place. It can help you:

* Open requisitions and determine job targeting.
* Source candidates via Recruiter Search.
* Manage your complete pipeline.
* Schedule interviews.
* Collect feedback from hiring committees.
* Extend offers to candidates.
