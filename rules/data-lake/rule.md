Imagine running a business without a clear, unified view of your data. Here's what you might face:

1. **Data Silos:** Different departments hoard their data, making it difficult to gather holistic insights about your business.
2. **Inefficiency:** You spend valuable time integrating data from disparate sources instead of generating insights.
3. **Cost Overruns:** Managing multiple systems for data integration, engineering, warehousing, and business intelligence inflates your costs.
4. **Impaired Decision Making:** Inconsistencies and lack of access to all data hinder informed decision-making.

Typically, companies managed this problem with Data Warehouses like having a SQL Server database to aggregate all their data.

These days, [data lakes](/understanding-data-lakes) make it easy to consolidate all data in an unstructured manner.

1. **Seamless Integration with Microsoft 365:** Microsoft Fabric can turn your Microsoft 365 apps into hubs for uncovering and applying insights, making data a part of everyday work
2. **Unified Capacities, Reduced Costs:** Microsoft Fabric unifies computing capacities across different workloads, reducing wastage and costs
3. **Simplified Management:** It consolidates necessary data provisioning, transformation, modeling, and analysis services into **one user interface**, simplifying data management
4. **Elimination of Data Duplication:** It enables easy sharing of datasets across the company, eliminating data duplication
5. **Smooth Transition:** Existing Microsoft products like Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Data Factory, and Azure Data Explorer connect seamlessly with Fabric, allowing a smooth transition
