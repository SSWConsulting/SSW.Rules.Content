When creating an appointment email for an initial meeting, make sure you include the words " **initial** " and " **meeting** " on the subject. 



::: greybox
 **Subject:**  Northwind project with SSW and Bob

:::





::: bad
Figure: Bad subject - not clear it is an initial meeting

:::




::: greybox
**Subject:** <mark>Initial meeting</mark> with SSW and Bob from Northwind
**Subject:** <mark>Initial</mark> phone <br>         <mark>meeting</mark> with SSW and Bob from Northwind
:::





::: good
Figure: Good subjects - Make clear it is an initial meeting by having both words

The Appointment should also be tracked (without regarding) in Dynamics 365 so that this information is readily available and reportable.

The idea behind it is that Power BI can then track and show this.
