In order to keep the rule you add is healthy and doesn't has any grammar or spelling mistake, you should follow the below steps once you finish adding a rule on an aspx page:

<!--endintro-->

1. Check the rule in MS Word (or [Grammarly](https&#58;//grammarly.com/)) to see [if it has spelling or grammar mistakes](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=fe16ec45-0d84-4a5b-8468-379e68b95987)
2. Run Link Auditor and Code Auditor on that page
3. Check the report and fix the error
4. Check in the page in TFS and repeat step 2 and 3 until Link Auditor and Code Auditor get all green ticks
