In order to keep the content you add is healthy (doesn't have grammar or spelling mistakes), follow the below steps once you add a page:

<!--endintro-->

1. Check the rule in MS Word (or [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com/)) to see [if it has spelling or grammar mistakes](/do-you-use-spelling-and-grammar-checker-to-make-your-email-professional)
2. Run Link Auditor and Code Auditor on that page
3. Check the report and fix the errors (if any)   
  Repeat step 2 and 3 until Link Auditor and Code Auditor get all green ticks
