You've got your development and operations teams working in silos, leading to delays in deployments and frequent bottlenecks. The lack of a streamlined process affects your ability to deliver features and fixes quickly. Implementing DevOps practices for continuous delivery can be the solution to these challenges.

## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the system development life cycle and provide continuous delivery.

### Benefits of Implementing DevOps

- **Speed**: DevOps enables you to deliver at a faster pace, improving your time to market.
- **Reliability**: Automated testing and continuous monitoring ensure that the changes are reliable.
- **Collaboration**: DevOps practices encourage greater communication and collaboration between teams.
