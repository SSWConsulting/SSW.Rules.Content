It is important to have a feed of what is happening in your project while still keeping a clean space to have discussions. This is why your Team should always have a Notifications channel.




A majority of these notifications can be created using the connectors that are built into Teams. To create a connection:



* Select the three dots in the top right of the screen and select "Connectors."

* Select "Add" on the connector that you want to use.

* Give the Connector a name that describes what it does.
* Complete the other configuration options for the Connector and click "Save."

Sometimes you may have to choose between multiple connectors that can serve the same base purpose. In this situation, it is good to choose the one that provides the important information in the easiest way.
