<p>There are two reasons that a story can be removed from the sprint. </p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<ol><li>Your team notices that they can’t get everything done, and agree with&#160;the product owner to remove the story.&#160; </li>
<li>At the Sprint Review meeting the Product Owner rejects the story </li></ol>
<div>There are a few reasons a team can find themselves in a position where they can't get everything done.</div>
<ol><li>They underestimated one or more stories</li>
<li>Stories were blocked by other stories</li></ol>
<p>In all cases, when a story is removed from the backlog,&#160;it moves back to the top of the backlog and&#160;any unfinished tasks left in the sprint are closed.&#160; When the Product Owner next grooms the backlog, or during the next planning meeting, he&#160;may decide to prioritise the story high enough to make the next Sprint, but he may not.</p>
