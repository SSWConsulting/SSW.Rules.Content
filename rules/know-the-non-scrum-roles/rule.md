Medium to large software development projects have people on them with varying roles and responsibilities. In order not to double up, or miss something, itâ€™s important to define what each should do.

Scrum already covers the roles of the **[Developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLqCkj0PvtE)**, the **[Product Owner](/do-you-know-the-how-to-be-a-good-product-owner)**, and the **[Scrum Master](/the-team-do-you-help-your-scrum-master-not-scrummaster-protect-and-serve-the-team)**, but from a consultancyâ€™s side, thereâ€™s also the **Tech Lead** and the **Account Manager** to consider.
