Scrum already covers the roles of the **[Developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLqCkj0PvtE)**, the **[Product Owner](/do-you-know-the-how-to-be-a-good-product-owner)**, and the **[Scrum Master](/the-team-do-you-help-your-scrum-master-not-scrummaster-protect-and-serve-the-team)**, but from a consultancy‚Äôs side, there‚Äôs also the **Tech Lead** and the **Account Manager** to consider.

Confusion often arises when these roles overlap, especially when sales or account managers step into delivery activities or when tech leads discuss matters outside their scope.

<!--endintro-->

## Account Manager

An Account Manager‚Äôs main job is to **own the relationship with the client** and ensure satisfaction, without stepping into daily project delivery. They should support the Tech Lead and Scrum Master, not replace them.

As a guiding principle, Account Managers should not join daily scrums or participate in technical conversations ‚Äî those are best left to the delivery team. However, relationships are fluid, and occasionally joining a stand-up (e.g., to check in with the client or resolve a relationship issue) may be appropriate. The key is to respect boundaries: don‚Äôt manage the project or the technical side of things.

### ‚ùå Generally avoid

* Joining daily scrums (unless there is a specific relationship issue to address)  
* Changing resources mid-week (resourcing changes should be deliberate and always involve the Tech Lead)  
* Having technical conversations with the client on the side without the Tech Lead present  

### ‚úÖ Focus on

* Managing communication from [initial contact](/do-you-manage-your-inbound-leads-effectively), to the [Initial Meeting](/meetings-do-you-know-the-agenda-for-the-initial-meeting), through to the [Spec Review](/rules-to-better-specification-reviews), until the main body of work is booked  
* Managing key relationships and ensuring the client is happy with the Tech Lead and Scrum Master  
* Getting [T&Cs](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Forms/ConsultingOrderTermsConditions.aspx) and other required documents signed  
* Entering and maintaining CRM data for Companies, Contacts, Opportunities, and [tracked emails](/track-important-emails)  
* Handling invoicing  
* Leading conflict resolution  
* Managing ongoing resourcing and [booking Developers](/scheduling-do-you-know-how-to-book-developers-for-a-project)  
* Facilitating budget discussions  
* Joining Sprint Reviews periodically (e.g., once a month, or more often if issues arise)  

## Tech Lead

### ‚ùå Generally avoid

* Discussing money or budget directly with the client

### ‚úÖ Focus on

* Displaying ownership of the project while keeping code quality high and technical debt low  
* Delivering the project into production  
* Spec review and project communication ‚Äî being the primary communicator with the Product Owner  
* DevOps ‚Äî ensuring good practices are followed (e.g., releasing to production as frequently as possible)  
* Taking responsibility for the architecture and technical direction of the project  
* Assisting the Account Manager with technical aspects of conflict management  
* Monitoring and managing the budget and timelines

### Hi {{ TECH LEAD }}

According to {{ LINK TO CLIENT CRM RECORD }}

As you can see, you are the Tech Lead for {{ CLIENT NAME }}.

1. Did you already know this?
2. Read [Do you know the non-Scrum roles of a project?](/know-the-non-scrum-roles) to make sure you know what is involved with this non-Scrum role (it‚Äôs not just responsibility of the technical decisions on the project üòâ)
3. Of those bullet points listed on the rule... which is your #1?
