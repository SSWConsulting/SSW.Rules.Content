You should prefix your sample databases with your company and products. This is so your users can tell easily at a glance what it is for. Sample databases should be named in the following way:

* SSWSQLAuditorNorthwindSample
* SSWSQLTotalCompareNorthwindSamplePub
* SSWSQLTotalCompareNorthwindSampleSub


Sample Access database are named similarly:

* SSWLookOutNorthwindSample2000.mdb
