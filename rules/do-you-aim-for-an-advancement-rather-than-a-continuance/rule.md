Once you have completed the initial meeting and provided a quote, you have to be careful to keep moving towards your goal of making the sale.

<!--endintro-->

In business, everyone is busy. The prospect you met with has a million things to do, and they may be relying on a decision from someone who also has a million things on their plate. It's easy to get stuck in a 'continuance cycle'. A continuance is basically a stalling tactic.

A prospect will tell you that they're still interested, but they haven't gotten around to making a decision for one reason or another. An advancement is a step that takes you closer to closing the sale. You should always aim for an advancement rather than a continuance. An advancement might be an agreement to complete mock-ups for the application. Often, small financial commitments will lead to bigger ones.

A great example of this practice is having a [Specification Review](/conduct-a-spec-review) being a stepping stone towards the full sale.
