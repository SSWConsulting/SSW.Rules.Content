<span class='intro'> 
  <p>You might&#160;have plenty of ideas when you are preparing your presentation. Add these in your TODO items&#160;- utilize them to attract your attention later in case you run out of time. </p>
<p>Note&#58; We suggest you keep them consistent with VS.NET e.g. “TODO&#58; xxx” </p>
 </span>

    <dd class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; Put your working &quot;TODO&#58;&quot; notes in red</dd>
