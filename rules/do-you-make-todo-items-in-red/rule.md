You might have plenty of ideas when you are preparing your presentation. Add these in your TODO items - utilize them to attract your attention later in case you run out of time.

Note: We suggest you keep them consistent with VS.NET e.g. “TODO: xxx”

<!--endintro-->
<dl>    &lt;dt&gt;<img class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" src="Todo.jpg" alt=""> &lt;/dt&gt;
     <strong>Figure: Put your working "TODO:" notes in red</strong> </dl>
