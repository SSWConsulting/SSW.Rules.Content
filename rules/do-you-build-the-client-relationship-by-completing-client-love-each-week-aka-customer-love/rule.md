Being a good developer is not enough. There are multiple factors that can affect whether a project proceeds in a positive or a negative way. One factor that can have a significant impact on a project is the relationship between the developer and the client.  
<!--endintro-->

A great way of taking a small step each week is to do something on a more personal basis for the client.

Each week give some love to your client. "Client Love", as I have seen, varies a lot. Here are some things I have seen:

* The developer notices that the topic of the upcoming SSW Tech Breakfast is appropriate and rings the client to offer them a free ticket.
* The developer sends them a SMS on the weekend saying... "I was just thinking about your project and I think this might be a good idea?
* The developer works back and gives a call on the way home to tell them what they did extra in their own time.
* The developer sends an IM with a link to a web article that would interest them.
* The developer buys the client their favourite coffee.
* The developer talks and listens to the client about non work related things. People generally love talking about themselves and appreciate it when someone listens; most people don't take the time to listen. Here are some examples I have seen:
    * How was your weekend?
    * What are you doing this weekend?
    * General talking about their family / remembering the names of their family members.
    * General talking about their hobbies.
The tasks don't have to cost anything. Free tasks are more thoughtful and show the client you are thinking about them.

Tasks should be completed whilst on client work. Once client work is completed, the developer should move onto the [Post Client Work](/Pages/Rules-to-Better-Software-Consultants---Dealing-with-Clients.aspx) rule.

Extra Reading: For some, the above comes naturally. For the rest of us, we highly recommend the book "How to Win Friends and Influence People" written by Dale Carnegie. It is an easy read, the principles are easy to implement and will not only change your client relationships but enhance all the relationships in your life for the better.
