Its important to have some pre-prepared ideas for the Brainstorming day. This helps the day run smoother and can make it more valuable.

GitHub Discussions provides an awesome way to let employees discuss the ideas before the Brainstorming day. GitHub Discussion template also make it easy for attendees to submit quality ideas in a consistent format.

To allow employees to submit ideas whenever they have them, set up a GitHub Repo and ask them to create a Discussion whenever they have an idea.
To ensure you get high quality ideas, create a structured template for the Discussion.   
You can use this repo template which contains SSW's Discussion template  
https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Brainstorming.Template

1 month before brainstorming, you should remind all attendees to submit a Discussion with their ideas.

1. First, look at ideas that have been added to the Brainstorming GitHub Discussion
2. Pre-cooking - Come up with a few ideas for the day, these should come from high-level people in the company.
3. If necessary, call the person who came up with the idea and ask for further explanation or for them to record a Done Video to sell their idea.
4. Send out an email asking people to submit any ideas they have. It should have a short explanation of the day, some previous success stories, and a link to all the GitHub discussions
