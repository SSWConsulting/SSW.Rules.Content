For a successful and streamlined Brainstorming Day, it's crucial to gather well-formed ideas in advance. This preparation not only smoothens the day's proceedings but also enhances its overall value.
 
Leveraging GitHub Discussions is an excellent strategy for facilitating early discussions among employees about their ideas. To standardize submissions and encourage high-quality contributions, we employ a GitHub Discussion template. This ensures that ideas are both innovative and consistent in format.

To capture spontaneous ideas, we've set up a dedicated GitHub Repository. Employees are encouraged to initiate a Discussion whenever inspiration strikes, using our structured template to maintain the quality of submissions. You can access and utilize our template here: [SSW's Brainstorming Discussion Template](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Brainstorming.Template).
                                                                                                                        ðŸ§»
As the Brainstorming Day approaches, a 1 month prior reminder for idea submission is crucial for attendees. This ensures ample time for idea refinement and preparation.
 
Key Steps for Idea Consolidation:
 
1. Review all submissions in the Brainstorming GitHub Discussions repository
2. Pre-cooking - get ideas from senior company members
3. For clarifications or expansions on submitted ideas, directly contact the contributors. Encourage them to create a 'Done Video' to effectively pitch their idea
4. Reminder - Circulate an email reminding employees to submit their ideas. This email should briefly describe the day's objectives, highlight past successes, and include links to the GitHub Discussions
 
This structured approach aims to harness collective creativity and ensure a fruitful Brainstorming Day.
