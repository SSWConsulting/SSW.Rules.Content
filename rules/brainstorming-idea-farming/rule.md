Beginning a Brainstorming Day without ideas prepared in advance is not a recipe for success. Time will be wasted either coming up with ideas, or preparing them to work on.

For a successful and streamlined Brainstorming Day, it's crucial to gather well-formed ideas in advance. This preparation smoothens the day's proceedings and increases its overall value.

[GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions) provides an awesome way to let employees discuss ideas before the Brainstorming day. A GitHub Discussion template makes it easy for attendees to submit quality ideas in a consistent format.

For a successful and streamlined Brainstorming Day, it's crucial to gather well-formed ideas in advance. This preparation not only smoothens the day's proceedings but also enhances its overall value.

To ensure you get high-quality ideas, create a structured template for the Discussion.   

::: info
**Tip:** You can use [this repo template which contains SSW's Discussion template](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Brainstorming.Template).
:::

One month before brainstorming, you should review the repo and then remind all attendees to submit a Discussion with their ideas:

1. Look at all existing ideas in the Brainstorming GitHub Discussions repo
  * If necessary, call the person who came up with the idea and ask for further explanation or for them to record a Done Video to sell their idea
    
2. Pre-cooking - Come up with a few ideas for the day, these should come from high-level people in the company

3. Send out an email asking people to submit any new ideas they have
  * It should have a short explanation of the day, some previous success stories, and a link to all the GitHub discussions
