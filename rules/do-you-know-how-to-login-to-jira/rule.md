Although we use Windows Domain authentication over LDAP, the domain domain is not required and the username must be in all lowercase. The url for SSW is <a href="http&#58;//jira.ssw.com.au/" shape="rect">http&#58;//jira.ssw.com.au/</a>

<p>If you're outside the network you will need the VPN at the moment. We have a task to make it visible externally but we need more external IP addresses first. </p>
<p>You can track progress on this at&#58; <a href="http&#58;//jira.ssw.com.au/browse/NET-48" shape="rect" target="_blank">NET-48</a></p>
<p>See screen below for sign in details</p>
