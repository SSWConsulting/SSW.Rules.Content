When you look at the Service Calendar, you want to be able to see, at a glance, who is working on what.



To do this, the subject field of appointments should be as follows:


<!--endintro-->


::: greybox
 **Client [Project] - Name[s]** 
:::




The project name (in parentheses) is optional and only used if there is more than one project happening simultaneously.

You can have 1 or many names, depending on the booking.






::: greybox
Go to ACME Corp
Work onsite for ACME Corp
Mehmet working at ACME Corp

:::


::: bad
Figure: Bad example - all inconsistent and hard to read  
:::


::: greybox
ACME Corp - Mehmet
 ACME Corp - Mehmet, Dan
ACME Corp (SharePoint) - Dan  
:::



::: good
Figure: Good Examples  
:::



The same format should also be used for leave requests ([the same for normal calendar appointments/invitations](/appointments-do-you-show-all-the-necessary-information-in-the-subject)).



::: greybox
Leave - Mehmet

:::


::: good
Figure: Good Example
