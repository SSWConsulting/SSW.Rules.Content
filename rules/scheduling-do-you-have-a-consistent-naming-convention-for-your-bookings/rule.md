When you look at the Service Calendar, you want to be able to see, at a glance, who is working on what.

To do this, the subject field of appointments should be as follows:

<!--endintro-->

::: greybox
**Client [Project] - Name[s]**
:::

The project name (in parentheses) is optional and only used if there is more than one project happening simultaneously.

You can have 1 or many names, depending on the booking.

::: greybox
Go to ACME Corp
Work onsite for ACME Corp
Mehmet working at ACME Corp

:::

::: bad
Figure: Bad example - all inconsistent and hard to read  
:::

::: greybox
ACME Corp - Mehmet
ACME Corp - Mehmet, Dan
ACME Corp (SharePoint) - Dan  
:::

::: good
Figure: Good Examples  
:::

The same format should also be used for leave requests ([the same for normal calendar appointments/invitations](/appointments-do-you-show-all-the-necessary-information-in-the-subject)).

::: greybox
Leave - Mehmet

:::

::: good
Figure: Good Example
