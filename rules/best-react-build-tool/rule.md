Creating a Production Build of a React project is complicated, you need great tools.

### Webpack

**[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/concepts)** is a module bundler. It packs CommonJs/AMD modules.


### Create React App

``` shell
npm run build
```

**[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/production-build)** uses Webpack under the hood.npm run build creates a build directory with a production build of your app.
