If your changes to your WebAPI break your client, then you want to know right away.

Using NSwag you should generate your API client eg. Angular Client.

* You run nswag.exe on the post-build event
* Nswag will generate the client code and update the API client file directly

![Figure: Good example â€“ using NSwag config file helps with automation. Since the API client is generated automatically next time we build, any breaking changes will be obvious immediately](using-nswag-helps-automation.jpg)

Now this is automated this is no longer a concern we need to deal with.
