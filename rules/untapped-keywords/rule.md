Choosing the right keywords will help your audience find your video. However, some keywords are very competitive (many people use them) so you need to “niche” your content as well.

<!--endintro-->

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Create a list of "seed keywords" (keywords and terms describing super broad topics (social media, LinkedIn marketing, Facebook page, content marketing… or another example, for a fitness site: fat loss, kettlebell workout, paleo diet, cardio workout).
2. Pop a seed keyword into YouTube Search and check out keywords that YouTube suggests.
3. Perform a “YouTube competition analysis” (we are looking for keywords that get many searches but aren’t super competitive).
4. You can use a Firefox/Chrome extension [TubeBuddy](https&#58;//www.tubebuddy.com/) which will show stats for each keyword.


Ideally, you would like to select keywords that appear in the YouTube suggestions as well as the videos from your competitors but also keywords that haven’t been used while still being relevant to your content. It is a good balance to find.
