There are many ways to write tasks in PBIs, but the best way is to use tasklists. This allows you to see the progress of the PBI at a glance as well as avoid any unintentional tasks being tracked. Below is the different ways you could write tasks in PBIs.

### Numbering tasks

When sending tasks in email, you might [number your tasks](/number-tasks-questions/) to make it clear what you want.

Although this would work in PBIs, it's not the best way to do it in GitHub.

### Using checklists

You can use checkboxes in PBIs to create a checklist for tasks

This will show a visual que as to how many tasks you've completed for the PBI.

These tasks are numbered, but if we were to re-order them we'd need to re-number them so the list makes sense again. A better approach to numbering tasks would be to convert a task into it's own issue, this allows you to detail it out further or have more in-depth conversations around the issue specifically.

One of the downsides to using checklists is that any checkbox in the issue description would show up as a task. This means that if you had a checkbox in the description that wasn't a task, it would show up as a task. This is why we recommend using tasklists.

### Using tasklists (recommended)

Lastly you should use the tasklist for your tasks, this gives the same advantages as standard checklists without interference from other checkboxes.

![Figure: Using tasklist requires a little extra markdown around your checkboxes](tasklists-markdown.jpg)

Besides the benefits described above, there's also the advantage of having a UI component built specifically to markup a tasklist.

You can see from the UI component there is a convenient button to add a task, easily see who is assigned to tasks; As well as a menu list of options to convert to issue, rename and remove tasks, all through the UI. This is great for team members who don't feel comfortable with markdown.
