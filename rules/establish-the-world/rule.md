When creating video content, it's crucial to start by setting up the world and the location where your content is taking place. This initial impression can significantly impact how your audience engages with your video. 

One effective way to achieve this is through the use of drone footage.

### Why establishing the world matters

- **Professionalism** - Incorporating drone footage signals a commitment to high-quality production, which can leave a lasting positive impression on your audience

- **Visual impact** - Drone shots can showcase epic landscapes and unique perspectives, captivating viewers and making your content visually engaging

- **Spatial awareness** - By showing the environment from above, drone footage helps viewers understand the geographical context of the video's location
