Getting accurate information from a client during a Spec Review can drastically decrease the cost of the project.  Not only will not accurately refining the product hurt in the long run but will waste the time of everyone involved. 

<!--endintro-->

Here are some tips that should help focus in on a feature to give a more accurate look into the product as a whole. 

### Tip 1: Check if they can explain the Process 

Ask if they already have a prototype of the Product or if someone can perform the task manually and can explain the process.  

### Tip 2: Draw a Mock-up or process flow diagram as you listen to the requirements

Creating mockups or diagrams of the Product/Feature as it is explained will be highly beneficial as the Client can see the feature visually. 

### Tip 3: Record Spec Reviews 

Recording the Spec Review is another great way to make the information as clear as possible. Being able to look back and clearly lookup what was mentioned saves a lot of time instead of having to re-ask questions.
