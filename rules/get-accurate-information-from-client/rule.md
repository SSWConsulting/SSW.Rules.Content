Getting the most accurate information from a client during a spec review can drastically decrease the amount of cost that a client would potentially pay. This rule will help you get the most out of your clients and your time by asking the question you need. 

<!--endintro-->

Getting accurate information from a client that has a loose idea can be a difficult task. Not only will not accurately refining the product hurt in the long run but will waste the time of everyone involved. 

**TODO: Get feedback on questions**

Here are some tips that should help focus in on a feature to give a more accurate look into the product as a whole. 

Ask if they already have something to share, if they already have a prototype of the Product all parties already have a great advantage of really refining the missing points from the prototype. 

Creating mockups of the Product/Feature as its explained will be highly beneficial as the Client gets another vector to express their thoughts into. 

Recording the spec review is another great way to make the information as clear as possible. Being able to look back and clearly lookup what was mentioned saves a lot of time instead of having to re-ask questions.
