Getting accurate information from a client during a Spec Review can drastically decrease the $ cost of the project.  Accurately refining the product avoids waste. 

<!--endintro-->

Here are some tips that should help focus in on a feature. 

### Tip 1: Check if the Product Owner can explain the process 

Ask if they already have a prototype of the feature or if someone can perform the task manually and can explain the process.  

### Tip 2: Draw a Mock-up or process flow diagram as you listen to the requirements

Creating mockups or diagrams of the feature will be highly beneficial as the client can see the feature visually. 

### Tip 3: Record Specification Reviews 

Recording the Specification Review is another great way to make the information as clear as possible. Being able to look back and clearly lookup what was mentioned, saves re-asking questions.
