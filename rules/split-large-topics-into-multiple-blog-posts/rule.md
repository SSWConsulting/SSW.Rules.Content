When blogging on a large topic, you have 2 options:

- **Option 1:** Write a very long blog post
- **Option 2:** Write a series of shorter blog posts (Recommended)

To help understand why option 2 is recommended, let's break it down into pros and cons.

<!--endintro-->

### Option 1: Write a very long blog post

| Pros | Cons | 
| -------- | --------- | 
| All content is available in one post (only one place to look) | You will get less views for longer posts | 
|          | It takes longer to write, you might lose motivation  |

### Option 2: Write a series of shorter blog posts

| Pros | Cons | 
| -------- | --------- | 
| You will get more views for longer posts | The content is spread across multiple posts | 
| Readers tend to prefer short posts |   | 
| Easy for readers to find the specifics details they are looking for |   | 
| Comments are more targeted on the topic |   | 
| It takes much less time to write a short post, so less likely to lose motivation |   | 
| Motivation to blog frequently, after all, people are waiting on you to finish the series |   |

If you want to get your ideas across, it will always be easier for the reader to understand a shorter blog post and it will always be easier for the writer to create a shorter blog post.

So next time you have a large topic, be sure to write a series of shorter blog posts (option 1). You will be doing yourself, and your readers, a big favour.
