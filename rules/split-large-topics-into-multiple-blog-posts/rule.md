When blogging on a large topic, you have 2 options:

- **Option 1:** Write a very long blog post
- **Option 2:** Write a series of shorter blog posts (Recommended)

To help understand why option 2 is recommended, let's break it down into pros and cons.

<!--endintro-->

### Option 1: Write a very long blog post

| Pros                                                          | Cons                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| All content is available in one post (only one place to look) | You will get less views for longer posts            |
|                                                               | It takes longer to write, you might lose motivation |

### Option 2: Write a series of shorter blog posts

| Pros                                                                                     | Cons                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| You will get more views for longer posts                                                 | The content is spread across multiple posts |
| Readers tend to prefer short posts                                                       |                                             |
| Easy for readers to find the specifics details they are looking for                      |                                             |
| Comments are more targeted on the topic                                                  |                                             |
| It takes much less time to write a short post, so less likely to lose motivation         |                                             |
| Motivation to blog frequently, after all, people are waiting on you to finish the series |                                             |

If you want to get your ideas across, it will always be easier for the reader to understand a shorter blog post and it will always be easier for the writer to create a shorter blog post.

So next time you have a large topic, be sure to write a series of shorter blog posts (option 1). You will be doing yourself, and your readers, a big favour.
