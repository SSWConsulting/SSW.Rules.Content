### DreamStudio 

DreamStudio is made by StabilityAI and is used, like DALLE2, on a web interface. It is based on the Stable Diffusion model of image generation. 

You can use the demo here for free [Stable Diffusion Web](https://stablediffusionweb.com/#demo), or you can use it through the [DreamStudio](https://beta.dreamstudio.ai/dream) interface (starting with a free trial).

* You can use the web demo without signing up
* Distinguishable because of the easy customization of parameters (e.g., style, aspect ratio) on the interface
