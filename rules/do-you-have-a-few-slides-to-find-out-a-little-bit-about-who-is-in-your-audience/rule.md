If you are presenting to people who you already know, then you have an enormous advantage over someone who is going to face an audience they have never previously met.

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <p>It is best to confirm who you are speaking to via a few slides. Then you can make subtle changes during your presentation so your audience gets:</p>
<ul>
    <li>What is important for them</li>
    <li>Interesting to them</li>
    <li>Relevant to them </li>
</ul>
