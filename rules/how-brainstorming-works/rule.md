At an annual Brainstorming day, employees are invited to share their ideas, give feedback, and pick the best one to work on. The benefits of Brainstorming are
[well understood](https://raybourn.com/the-5-benefits-of-brainstorming/), but in order to focus the productivity on something useful, it is important to have a system for suggesting, voting, and working on ideas.

Everyone at the company is encouraged to suggest ideas prior.

Brainstorming days are complex to run. They require a lot of preparation leading up to the day and follow-up work afterwards.

Here is the schedule that should be followed.

1. Book in a day - this should be done months before the Brainstorming day to allow time for planning and for people to think of ideas.
2. 2 weeks before - [Idea Farming and refinement](/brainstorming-idea-farming)
3. 1 week before - [Team allocation and setup](/brainstorming-team-allocation)
4. [Brainstorming day](/brainstorming-agenda)
5. [Brainstorming Retro](/brainstorming-day-retro)
6. [Digesting Brainstorming](/digesting-brainstorming)
