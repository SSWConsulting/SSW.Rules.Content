At an annual brainstorming day, employees are invited to share their ideas, give feedback, and pick the best one to work on. The benefits of brainstorming are
[well understood](https://raybourn.com/the-5-benefits-of-brainstorming/), but in order to focus the productivity on something useful, it is important to have a system for suggesting, voting, and working on ideas.

Everyone at the company is encouraged to suggest ideas prior.

Brainstorming days are complex to run. They require a lot of preparation work.

Here is the schedule that should be followed

1. Book in a day - this should be done months before the Brainstorming day to allow time for planning and for people to think of ideas. Send out an email to the company E.g.

### Hi All,

I’m really excited about our brainstorming day! I hope you’re all thinking about what you would like to work on.

To prepare for our Brainstorming day, send Adam, Matt W, William, Piers and Brady something that you would like work on as a group.
E.g. Our awesome SophieBot project came out of the Melbourne Brainstorming Session last year.

Tip: A Done Video can help explain and sell your idea to other attendees ⭐
