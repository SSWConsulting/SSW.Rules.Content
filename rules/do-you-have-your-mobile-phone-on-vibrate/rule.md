If you were talking to someone, when their phone rang; would you want them to answer it? If they were using a loud ring tone, the only way to continue your conversation would be to wait until they had finished or, at least, they would have to get their phone out to hang up. Why should the person who called get preferential treatment and be able to jump the queue?&#160;<div><br></div><div>Your mobile phone is a very useful tool. However, it can also be a nuisance. To make sure it doesn't interrupt your daily activities, you should always put it on vibrate. </div><div><br>If you have a wearable device like a&#160;Microsoft Band&#160;that connects to your phone, your wrist vibrates&#160;when&#160;you recieve a call.&#160;This alerts you to your incoming call silently even if you are not near your phone, and means you *never* need to have your phone on anything but VIBRATE. Microsoft Bands also have the added advantage of allowing you to send a&#160;text message-based quick response&#160;right from the device letting your caller know you are busy.&#160;<br></div>
