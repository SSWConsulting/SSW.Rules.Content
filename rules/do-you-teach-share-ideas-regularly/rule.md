Each team member has their own set of skills. There is no use hiding those skills                     "under a bushel". If you can at least share one idea a week the team's shared knowledge                     increases. This has many positive spin-offs, for example, the teams don't become                     reliant upon one individual, and when your idea is adopted your confidence increases                     allowing you to make more contributions in the future. Importantly, it's not only                     management that should contribute this way. Everyone has something to share.

William                     McKnight, the chair of 3M said: *"It is essential that we have  **many people** with initiative if we are to continue to grow."*

As an example, if you have a handy tip, send an email to your team or add it                     to the KB.
