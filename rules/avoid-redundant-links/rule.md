Often pages have 2 or 3 links pointing to the same page - all fairly close to each other, like in 1 or 2 paragraphs. Multiple links to the exact same page should be avoided because they:

* Distract users from reading the main text content
* Confuse users as they have to decide which link to click first (and then end up to the same place anyway)
* Annoy users when they are repeatedly directed to the same page

<!--endintro-->

::: info
The exception is if you have the links in different sections of the page (e.g. 1 in the content, 1 in the "Related" section).
:::

It is a good idea to **not** have multiple links to the exact same page section.
