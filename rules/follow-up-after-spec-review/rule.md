When a Spec Review concludes, the journey towards project kickoff is only partially complete. For instance, imagine a scenario where the client had multiple questions and slight hesitations about the estimates provided during the Spec Review. Without a structured follow-up, these hesitations could evolve into concerns, possibly stalling the project before it even begins.

At the end of the Spec Review presentation with the client, work out a good time for the follow-up meeting and book it into their calendar immediately.

### Objectives of the follow-up meeting

The follow-up meeting is a crucial step in ensuring a smooth transition from the Spec Review to the initiation of the project. Here's why and how we conduct this meeting:

#### 1. Reaffirming priorities

Revisit the MVP backlog to ensure there has been no shift in priorities. It's essential to keep the project aligned with the client's expectations and business objectives.

::: greybox
Client: _"We initially thought Feature A was crucial, but now we believe Feature B should take precedence."_

Account Manager: _"No problem, we can re-evaluate the backlog and adjust the estimates accordingly."_
:::
::: good
Good example - Adapting to clientâ€™s evolving priorities maintains alignment and trust

#### 2. Encouraging new insights

The Spec Review often sparks new ideas or considerations. Encourage the client to share any fresh insights or concerns, which could be pivotal for the project.

#### 3. Clarifying estimates and timelines

Present an updated estimate reflecting any changes post Spec Review, ensuring clarity on the number of Sprints, developers needed, and the overall cost.

#### 4. Outlining next steps

Clearly outline the subsequent steps, identifying any immediate actions required from either party to move forward.

#### 5. Improving through feedback

Retro - Solicit feedback on the Spec Review process to continuously refine it, enhancing the experience for future projects.

#### 6. Addressing legal and administrative details

Delve into any T&Cs, NDAs, or other administrative details requiring attention before project commencement.

### Appointment template

To facilitate the scheduling of the follow-up meeting, here's a template that Account Managers can use:
