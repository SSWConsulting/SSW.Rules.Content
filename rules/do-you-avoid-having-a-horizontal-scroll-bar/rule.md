<span class='intro'> <p>
                    One of the most annoying things when you're surfing a site is to have to use a horizontal
                    scroll bar to view all of the information. Not being able to view all the information
                    from left to right of screen, makes the web page harder and slower to read. The
                    Reader should find the web page easy to navigate, to make viewing the website an
                    enjoyable experience.</p> </span>

                    Therefore it is bad web design to use a horizontal scroll bar. When designing your
                    site, the page text should respect the user's desire to resize the browser window
                    and have text wrap correctly. Also, you should take into consideration the effect
                    that different screen resolutions will have on how much can fit onto the screen.</p><dl class="badImage"><dt>
