Using Boot to VHD is very similar to dual-booting your machine, except that you do not have to partition your hard drive. It also has performance benefits over using a Hyper-V server for presentations.   
<!--endintro-->
**Pre-Requisites** 


* The presentation computer running Windows
* A SysPreped VHD image to be deployed onto the presentation computer


1. Copy a SysPreped VHD image to the laptop to be used for the presentation.
2. Open an Administrative command prompt.
3. Type:



```
bcdedit /copy {default} /d “Demo-NameOfDemo”
```

4. Type:



```
bcdedit /set <GUID>  device vhd=[D:]\VM-DEV-SharePoint_2010_Public_Beta.vhd
```



**D:\** is the drive the VHD is located and  **VM-DEV-SharePoint\_2010\_Public\_Beta.vhd** is the location of your VHD file. Make sure you replace  **&lt;GUID&gt;** with the GUID you got in the previous step.
5. Type:



```
bcdedit /set <GUID>  osdevice vhd=[D:]\VM-DEV-SharePoint_2010_Public_Beta.vhd
```



**D:\** is the drive the VHD is located and  **VM-DEV-SharePoint\_2010\_Public\_Beta.vhd** is the location of your VHD file. Make sure you replace  **&lt;GUID&gt;** with the GUID you got in the previous step.
6. Type:



```
bcdedit /set <GUID> detecthal on
```

**Figure - Each time you run a BCDEdit command it should return "The operation completed successfully"**
7. Reboot the computer and now you will have the option to choose between Windows 7 and the new Boot to VHD image.
