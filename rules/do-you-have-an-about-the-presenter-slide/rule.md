<span class='intro'> 
  <p>Always introduce yourself *after* you have asked the audience who they are. Don't be shy, tell them&#58;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Who are you? (optional - include something personal)</li>
    <li>What you do (your service or product)?</li>
    <li>What makes you qualified to speak on this topic?</li>
</ul>
 </span>
