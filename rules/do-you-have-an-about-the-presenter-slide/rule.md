Always introduce yourself \*after\* you have asked the audience who they are. Don't be shy, tell them:

* Who are you? (optional - include something personal)
* What you do (your service or product)?
* What makes you qualified to speak on this topic?

     <strong>Figure: Talk about yourself after you know the audience a little. It is not great to bring up the 'About' slide too early</strong> </dl>
