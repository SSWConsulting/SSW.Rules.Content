<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Topics are a great way to classify your repositories on GitHub. Topics are free text tags that help identify the technologies, purpose, and intent of your project, and can increase the discoverability of your repo for both machine learning algorithms and human searchers.<br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>​GitHub introduced topics in 2017, and you can use topics to search for repositories. For example, if you are looking for Blazor examples or libraries, you can enter Blazor as a search term, and then refine the search to repositories that have been tagged with the ‘Blazor’ topic.<br></p><dl class="image"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/github-repositories-topics-search.jpg" alt="github-repositories-topics-search.jpg" style="width&#58;750px;" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Searching for repositories by topic</dd></dl><p>Topics also help others to find your repository and increase the visibility and discoverability of your work.</p><dl class="badImage"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/github-repositories-topics-bad.jpg" alt="github-repositories-topics-bad.jpg" style="width&#58;750px;" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Bad Example – no repositories tagged with topics on the first page</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/github-repositories-topics-good.jpg" alt="github-repositories-topics-good.jpg" style="width&#58;750px;" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Great example – every repository is meticulously tagged with topics</dd></dl>​<br>
