<span class='intro'> <p>Why do so many interesting pages have no owner? There are countless articles on the web that have left the reader wondering&#58;&#160;&quot;Who wrote this? What is their background?</p><p>Sometimes, the only available link is&#160;<span style="line-height&#58;20px;">author’s email</span><span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">, which doesn't say anything about them. Sure, contact info is often a good part of the biography, but it should not be the primary or only piece of data about the author.​</span></p>​ </span>

​<span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">Different article layouts can be&#58;</span><ul><li>Articles with a column and no authors listed - <strong>Very Bad</strong></li><li>Articles with authors but no link to their biographies - <strong>Bad</strong></li><li>Articles with authors but only a &quot;mailto&#58;&quot; link for direct email - <strong>
                        Average</strong></li><li>Articles with an acknowledgements section and a link to the biographies - <strong>
                        Good</strong></li></ul><p>
                    Users often want to know the people behind information. Biographies and photographs
                    of the authors help make the web a less impersonal place and increase trust. Personality
                    and point-of-view always win over anonymity.</p><p>
                    So every web page or document should have an owner and include a&#160;link with more information about the author​.</p>
