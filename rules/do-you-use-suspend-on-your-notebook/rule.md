<span class='intro'> â€‹Being developers, it's often the case that we have to take our notebooks to visit a client or even home for the day. Using the suspend option is a great way to make sure time isn't wasted. Instead of shutting down and restarting (which as we know can be a lengthy operation) using suspend you can be working again much more quickly, meaning you can utilize that extra 10 mins in the car or on the train.&#160;Also, a good option is to have an SSD (Solid State Drive, as opposed to a Hard Drive) as your primary Operational System drive, as it drives the boot time down considerably.<br> </span>

<p>Your notebook should also be configured so that if it is left in suspend for a long period of time (more than 10 minutes) it will automatically&#160; hibernate. However, your notebook should not automatically suspend or hibernate if the lid is simply closed. Both of these settings are in the Power Options in Control Panel.</p><br><div><img src="PowerOptions.PNG" alt="PowerOptions.PNG" style="margin&#58;5px;" />&#160;</div>
