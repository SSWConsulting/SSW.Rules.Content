<span class='intro'> 
  <p>ASP.NET is file system driven, SharePoint is database driven – all SharePoint content and meta data comes from a database, include images, HTML, Master Page, etc. SharePoint provides a framework where components can be plugged in, and out of the box these areas are improved&#58;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Security model, membership, permissions </li>
    <li>There’s a relatively consistent UI framework </li>
    <li>Menus, navigation and site maps </li>
    <li>Administration of access, site owners can change permissions for that site – without admins </li>
</ul>
<p>Deployment model is very different&#58; </p>
<ul>
    <li>ASP.NET has MSI file or XCopy deployment – individual server </li>
    <li>SharePoint deployment is via Solution Package – but goes cross site farms </li>
    <li>Deployment is both declarative in XML format, as well as in code with Feature and Event receivers </li>
</ul>
<p>Tools&#58;</p>
<ul>
    <li>ASP.NET is mostly done in Visual Studio .NET </li>
    <li>SharePoint development is split among&#58;
    <ul>
        <li>Internet Explorer – SharePoint configurations (note&#58; non IE browsers remain 2nd level and isn’t as good as IE with SharePoint) </li>
        <li>Microsoft SharePoint Designer – SharePoint HTML page design and customization </li>
        <li>Visual Studio .NET – custom web parts, custom workflows, solution packages </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
