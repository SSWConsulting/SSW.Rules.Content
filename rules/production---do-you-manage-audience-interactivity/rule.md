One of the hardest things to deal with when presenting to an audience is the correct way to deal with questions. 
<!--endintro-->

Try and give firm guidelines when you start as to the correct way to ask a question.

SPEAKER: "No questions please. Ask your questions at the end"

Figure: Bad Example - this kills the sense of interactivity that is so appealing about live presentations

SPEAKER: "Questions<br>are fine as long as they are on-topic, something about the current slide"

Figure: Good Example - this allows interactivity but stops the audience from distracting and derailing the speaker

It is quite common for one audience member to derail the speaker with a lot of questions. If this happens, simply respond:

SPEAKER: "OK Bob, I think that is your 10th question and your quota has expired. I want to give everyone a fair go, so you get 1 more question after this. OK?"

Figure: Good Example - this is a firm yet polite way of managing the situation
