<span class='intro'> <p>​​Many developers are frightened of making a change to the existing database because they just don't know what applications are using it. This is especially a problem when you are dealing with&#160;databases that you did not create. Here are some approaches to this issue&#58;<br></p> </span>

<ol><li>You could run around the office and find some one and hope they know (unbelievably this seems this the most common method!)</li><li>Trawl through source control, all network locations and all the source code around to check what connection strings are being used</li><li>You can have a zsApplication table and manually populate with application it uses (Recommended). This can be populated with a run of a SQL profiler over a period of a week so all usage is captured.

This method is the most comprehensive option but is not recommended because you get a constant performance hit from SQL Profiler running.<br>
