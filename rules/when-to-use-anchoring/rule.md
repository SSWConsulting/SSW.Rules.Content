Anchoring is a cognitive bias where individuals rely heavily on the first piece of information they encounter (the "anchor") when making decisions. This initial information then influences subsequent thinking and judgments, often leading to skewed conclusions or estimations. Anchoring can occur consciously or unconsciously and can significantly impact decision-making from negotiations.

While anchoring can be a powerful technique in certain situations, it's essential to consider its potential drawbacks and the context in which it is used to achieve the most postitive outcome to a situation. During meetings, senior people should give their opinions last to avoid creating bias to foster better collaboration and discussion.

## You may be asked to use an anchor in a meeting to:

1. **Set Price and Timeframe:** In software development, this would be done after the spec review. Although clients want an initial estimate, which will set their anchor, 
2. **Set Expectations:** Anchoring can help set initial expectations for discussions, projects, or negotiations, providing a reference point to guide the conversation towards desired outcomes.
3. **Influence Perceptions:** Presenting a strong anchor can shape how others perceive the merits of a proposal increasing support.
4. **Encourage Compromise:** Anchoring can prompt clients to adjust their positions or expectations, facilitating compromise and consensus-building in complex or contentious situations.
