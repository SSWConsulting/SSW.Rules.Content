If you’re working with LinkedIn Talent Hub solutions and don’t want to use your primary LinkedIn account, you will need to create a second one. The issue is that the secondary account will show up when people search for your name:

Unfortunately there is no way to disable/hide your secondary profile if it is associated with Talent Hub:
