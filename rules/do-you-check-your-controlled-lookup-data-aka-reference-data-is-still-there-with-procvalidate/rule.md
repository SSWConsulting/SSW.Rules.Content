<span class='intro'> 
  <p>
    <a href="/Pages/DoYouDeployLookupData.aspx">Controlled Lookup Data</a> is when data is tightly coupled to the application. If the data is not there, you&#160;have problems. So how do we check to see if data is still there?</p>
<p>The simplest way is to add a procValidate (Stored Procedure) to check that all the lookup data is still there.</p>

Let's look at an example, of a combo that is populated with Controlled Lookup data (just 4 records)&#160;&#160;

Note&#58; As this procedure will be <a href="/Pages/DoYouIgnoreIdempotency.aspx">executed many times, it must be Idempotent </a>
