When every button looks a little different, spacing feels off, and handoffs between design and dev are painful, you know something’s wrong. These issues lead to inconsistent UIs, longer review cycles, and time wasted on debating visual tweaks instead of building real value.  
A design system can fix all of that—it aligns everyone around a shared language and provides the tools to build faster and better.

**Video: Welcome to Design Systems – Lesson 1: Introduction to Design Systems (15 min)**

## Key Components

A solid design system should include:

- **Design tokens** – Variables for color, spacing, typography, etc., ensuring consistency and scalability.
- **Style guide** – Covers branding, grids, iconography, motion, and accessibility guidelines.
- **Component library** – Reusable elements like buttons, forms, and modals built in your design tool with variants and usage guidance.
- **Tooling integration** – Sync tokens to code using tools like Figma Tokens, Style Dictionary, or CI/CD pipelines.
- **Documentation portal** – Live demos, usage do’s and don’ts, changelogs, and versioning.
- **Governance** – Clear ownership, a contribution process, and semantic versioning to manage updates.

## Why It Works

- **One source of truth** – Everyone (designers, developers, PMs, QA) works from the same playbook.
- **Change once, update everywhere** – Avoids manual rework and reduces inconsistencies.
- **Faster builds** – Shared components and patterns boost delivery speed.
- **Accessibility baked-in** – Standards like contrast, keyboard nav, and screen-reader support come by default.
- **No more style debates** – Predefined standards cut through subjective design opinions.

## Signs You’re Due for a Design System

- Spacing, fonts, or colors shift between screens for no reason.
- Handoffs and review meetings are dominated by nitpicking visual issues.
- Figma doesn’t match production.
- Style guides are outdated, scattered, or missing entirely.

## Real-World Examples

* **[Material Design](https://m3.material.io/)** (Google)  
  Theming, deep docs, and ready-to-use code
* **[Polaris](https://polaris.shopify.com/)** (Shopify)  
  Design, content, and accessibility all-in-one
* **[Carbon](https://carbondesignsystem.com/)** (IBM)  
  Enterprise-level, open source, and WCAG-compliant
* **[Atlassian Design System](https://atlassian.design/)**  
  Includes tokens, patterns, tone of voice, and code

## Start Small in 7 Steps
1. **Audit your UI** – Look for visual and structural inconsistencies.
2. **Define tokens** – Start with color, spacing, and typography.
3. **Build your first 3 components** – Focus on core UI elements.
4. **Integrate tokens** – Use Figma Tokens or Style Dictionary.
5. **Document as you go** – Add usage rules, visual examples, and versioning.
6. **Share internally** – Use demos and changelogs to get buy-in.
7. **Govern wisely** – Assign owners, plan updates, and gradually layer in code.

**Quick-start tip:** Kick off with a shared Figma library and just 5 key components to prove value, then expand.
