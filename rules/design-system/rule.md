When every button looks a little different, spacing feels off, and handoffs between design and dev are painful, you know something's wrong. These issues lead to inconsistent UI, longer review cycles, and time wasted debating visual tweaks instead of building real value.  

A design system can fix all of that—it aligns everyone around a shared language and provides the tools to build faster and better.

**Video: Welcome to Design Systems – Lesson 1: Introduction to Design Systems (15 min)**

## Key components

A solid design system should include:

* **Style guide and design tokens** – Brand guidelines, color variables, typography, iconography, spacing grids, and accessibility guidance
* **Component library** – Reusable UI elements like buttons or inputs, built in your design tool with variants and usage guidance. May include page templates and broader patterns
* **Documentation** – Guidelines for component usage, do’s and don’ts, examples and demos
* **Design system governance** – Clear ownership of the design system, a contribution process, tools for dev handover, and semantic versioning to manage updates

## Why it works

* **One source of truth** – Everyone (designers, developers, POs, QA) works from the same playbook, avoiding continuous rework and reducing inconsistency. Changes are made in one place which scales across projects
* **Faster build time** – Shared components and patterns boost delivery speed
* **Accessibility baked-in** – Standards like contrast, keyboard nav, and screen-reader support come by default
* **No more debates** – Defined design standards cut through subjective opinion

## Signs you’re due for a Design System

* Spacing, fonts, or colors shift between screens for no reason
* Handoffs and review meetings are dominated by nitpicking visual issues
* Design doesn’t match production
* Style guides are outdated, scattered, or missing entirely

## Real-world examples

* **[Material Design](https://m3.material.io/)** (Google)  \
  Theming, deep docs, and ready-to-use code
* **[Polaris](https://polaris.shopify.com/)** (Shopify)  \
  Design, content, and accessibility all-in-one
* **[Carbon](https://carbondesignsystem.com/)** (IBM)  \
  Enterprise-level, open source, and WCAG-compliant
* **[Atlassian Design System](https://atlassian.design/)**  \
  Includes tokens, patterns, tone of voice, and code

## Start small in 7 steps

1. **Audit your UI** – Look for visual and structural inconsistencies
2. **Define tokens** – Start with color, spacing, and typography
3. **Build your first components** – Focus on core UI elements (i.e. header, footer, buttons, input fields)
4. **Integrate tokens** – Use Figma Tokens or Style Dictionary
5. **Document as you go** – Add usage rules, visual examples, and versioning
6. **Share internally** – Use demos and changelogs to get buy-in
7. **Govern wisely** – Assign owners, plan updates, and gradually layer in code

**Quick-start tip:** Kick off with a shared Figma library and key components to provide value, then expand.
