Customers get cranky when developers make a change, and this causes a bug to pop up somewhere else. They may also complain that they shouldn't have to pay for this new bug to be fixed. Although this is understandable, fixing bugs is a large part of the project and is always billable, although if these bugs can be caught early, they are quicker and cheaper to fix.

<!--endintro-->

When writing code, one of the most time consuming and frustrating parts of the process is finding that something you have changed has broken something you're not looking at. These bugs often don't get found for a long time as they are not the focus of the "test please" and only get found later by users.

The best way to avoid this issue is to use Tests. These double check your core logic is still working every time you compile and will minimize the number of bugs that get through your internal testing and end up being found by the client.

This is a "Pay now -pay much less later" approach.
