<p>​​​​​​In any job, you will most likely at some point face some criticism. Someone may be telling you that you’ve done something wrong or just expressing displeasure because you didn’t do something they wanted.<br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>The best way to take this is to reply to the person, and tell them the following 3 things&#58;</p><ol><li>Apologize if it was your fault, or explain if it wasn't, but then do the next 2 steps regardless...</li><li>Show that&#160;you've fixed th​e problem (if possible)</li><li>Explain what&#160;system you've put in place to ensure that the same issue won't happen again</li></ol><p>Even if you've been wrongly accused of something, you should still do steps 2 and 3,&#160;as it shows great initiative.&#160;Always have a view to the future and the big picture.</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox"><img src="/PublishingImages/dilbert-criticism-1.gif" alt="dilbert-criticism-1.gif" style="margin&#58;5px;" /><br></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureNormal"> Figure&#58; make sure you know how to take criticism well </dd><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureNormal"> <div class="ms-rtestate-read ms-rte-wpbox"><div class="ms-rtestate-notify  ms-rtestate-read 82501a2d-ffaa-4b83-859a-9bb76e8613fe" id="div_82501a2d-ffaa-4b83-859a-9bb76e8613fe" unselectable="on"></div><div id="vid_82501a2d-ffaa-4b83-859a-9bb76e8613fe" unselectable="on" style="display&#58;none;"></div></div>​​​<br></dd>
