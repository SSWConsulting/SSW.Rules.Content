One of the great things about email is that as a conversation progresses, you always have the thread history that you can refer to for context. 

Calendar appointments, on the other hand, don’t have this. Therefore, if you make plans via email, and that email conversation includes details like times, agendas, locations, etc. It’s usually a good idea to **copy the email text into the body of the calendar appointment**. That way you’ve got the history and context right there, so the attendees don’t have to go searching for it in their inbox.

::: info
**Warning:** With calendar appointments, there is a risk of people accepting the appointment without reading the content – it doesn't happen with emails. If you are initiating an appointment that has a task in it (when you expect a ‘done’) then **duplicate the content of the appointment into an email**.

### Hi Adam,

I am the Scrum Master of the upcoming Northwind project and I’d like to understand the specific performance and code quality requirements

1.	Can you meet with me and review the current SSW CodeAuditor rules we need to enforce per Sprint for the upcoming Northwind project?
2.	Once I understand, can you communicate those rules to the developers on the project?

Sophie

**Figure: Calendar appointment with tasks should be copied from an email, so the items assigned get read via the email (better visibility), and also the email can get replied to with a ‘done’**
