All team members must update their tasks with <b>status</b>, <b>remaining hours</b>, <b>completed hours</b> and <strong>comments</strong> prior to the daily Scrum meeting; in the case where the Scrum meeting is in the morning, this should be done at the end of the previous business day. <br>​

This is the best way to control how the sprint is going and make necessary improvements on work to avoid sprint fails.</p>
