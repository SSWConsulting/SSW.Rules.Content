<span class='intro'> <p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​​​​​All team members must update their tasks with 
status, 
remaining hours, 
completed hours and 
comments prior to the daily Scrum meeting.&#160;When&#160;the Scrum meeting is in the morning, this should be done at the end of the previous business day.</p> </span>

This is not an issue with TFS 2012 as the Burndown will update in real-time, but the rule still applies, as the Daily Scrum flows more smoothly if each developer has already updated the remaining hours on their tasks.</p><div>
