Leaving your desk for a coffee, catching up with friends for lunch, or attending a meeting in the boardroom, are just some of the reasons why we leave our workstations throughout the day.  

But did you know that you might be exposing your company to a potential security risk?

Good news! Its a simple solution: Lock your computer when you leave!

In this rule, we will be looking at why we should lock our computers when we leave our workstations, and some quick and easy ways to make this apart of your daily routine.

## Why it is important

Here are some reasons why it's important to lock your computer when you leave your workstation, even for a second!

* **Access** - Someone can acquire important or private information, and even delete or change files
* **Peering eyes** - Passerby's might see sensitive data, i.e. Payroll

### Lock your Windows PC automatically when you step away from it

Windows can use devices that are paired with your PC to help detect when you’re away, then it can lock your PC shortly after your paired device is out of Bluetooth range.

This makes it more difficult for someone to gain access to your device if you step away from your PC and forget to lock it.
