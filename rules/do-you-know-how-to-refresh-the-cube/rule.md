The cube is by default refreshed every two hours, but what is you are about to go into a status meeting and you want up to date reports?

You can refresh the cube manually using the web services, but only from the TFS server:

<!--endintro-->
<dl>&lt;dt&gt;<img alt="Warehouse WebControl Service " src="WarehouseWebControlService.jpg">&lt;/dt&gt;
<dd></dd></dl>
Read [Refresh the TFS Warehouse manually](http://www.ewaldhofman.nl/post/2009/11/25/Refresh-the-TFS-Warehouse-manually.aspx) 
 for more detail.
