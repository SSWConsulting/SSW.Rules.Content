intro
why different
mention combination -> strategy

<!--endintro-->

original: Confuses types of testing with testing techniques. Doesn’t mention consumer-driven contract testing explicitly

new: Define different types and why they’re different & important - intent of each type is to mitigate particular risks. Using different types attacks more types of risks.

mention exploratory testing as an approach that applies to some of these types?

what else?
