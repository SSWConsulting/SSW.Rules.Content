There are many different types of testing, each designed to help mitigate different types of risk.

A good test strategy employs a combination of different types of testing, performed using an appropriate mix of human testing and automation.

The following list of types of testing is not exhaustive, but covers the more common types you should consider when building a comprehensive test strategy:

| Testing type | Perform this type of testing to mitigate the risk of...  |
| :------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| Smoke testing | Basic and critical functionality failing to work as expected  |
| Unit testing | Code changes |
| Integration testing | Problems introduced by different modules or services interacting with each other |
| Consumer-driven contract testing | Changes to a service impacting the consumers of that service |
| Regression testing  | Intentional code changes causing unintended effects |     
| End-to-end testing | Real users' journeys through the software becoming broken |
| Acceptance testing  | Failing to meet the business/user requirements |
| Performance testing   | Surprises when the software is under load |

::: info
Don't confuse test approaches & techniques (focused on the "how") with types of testing (the "what"). For example, [exploratory testing](/what-is-exploratory-testing) - as an approach - applies well to several of the types of testing outlined above.
:::

### Smoke testing

Smoke testing is designed to verify that the critical functionality of the software is working, at a very high level. The software is put under limited pressure (undergoing only shallow testing) to make sure no smoke comes out.

The smoke test is meant to be quick to execute, with the goal of giving you some assurance that the major features of your system are working as expected. 

Smoke tests can be useful right after a new build is made to decide whether or not you can run deeper (and more expensive) tests, or right after a deployment to make sure that they application is running properly in the newly deployed environment.

### Unit testing

Unit testing is designed to help mitigate the risk of code changes. Unit tests are designed to be small in scope and they typically consist of testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components or modules used by your software. 

Unit tests are generally quick to run and are executed in an automated manner as part of a CI pipeline.

Unit tests are usually written by developers and external dependencies are mocked so that the tests only test the method or function of interest and not anything the method or function might depend on.

### Integration testing

Integration tests verify that different modules, components or services used by your application work well together. For example, this could be testing interaction with a database or making sure that microservices work together as expected. 

For modern applications, integration tests are often implemented using the application's various APIs.

These types of tests are more expensive to run (as they require multiple parts of the application to be up and running) and are typically automated.

### Consumer-driven contract testing

Although it falls into the category of integration testing, it's worth calling out consumer-driven contract testing as a separate testing type because it is an excellent way to implement integration testing in microservices-based architectures.

Consumer-driven contract testing is a way of integration testing a service's API prior to deploying it to a microservices-based system. Consumers define their expectations of providers in contracts, which the provider service is then responsible for meeting whenever it makes changes. In this way, a provider service can continue to change, safe in the knowledge that its consumers will not be negatively impacted by their changes. This makes consumer-driven contract testing especially useful when the system under test comprises a lot of independently developed & deployed microservices - and this type of system is essentially impossible to test using more traditional integration testing.

### Regression testing

Regression testing is designed to look at unchanged features of the application to make sure that the addition, deletion or updating of features and any bug fixes have not adversely impacted the existing features.

This type of testing is often performed before a deployment or release of the software and can be time-consuming and expensive. Making risk-based selections of which tests to perform and the judicious use of automation can both reduce the time required for regression testing.

### End-to-end testing

End-to-end testing is designed to replicate user behaviours with the software in a complete application environment. It is a type of system testing that follows a user's (or data's) journey through the system.

While end-to-end tests can be very useful, they're expensive to perform and can be hard to maintain when they're automated. It is recommended to have a few key end-to-end tests and rely more on lower level types of testing (unit and integration tests) to be able to quickly identify breaking changes.

:::

### Acceptance testing

Acceptance testing is designed to verify that the software meets the business requirements. This type of testing requires the entire application to be running while testing and focuses on replicating user behaviours.

A special case is User Acceptance Testing (UAT) in which the software is delivered to the end-users for them to test to make sure it meets their requirements.

### Performance testing 

![You don't want to make headline news, so don't forget about performance testing! (www.hulldailymail.co.uk)](performance-testing.jpg)

Performance testing is designed to evaluate how a system performs under a particular workload. These tests help to measure the reliability, speed, scalability and responsiveness of an application. For example, a performance test can observe response times when executing a high number of requests or determine how a system behaves with a significant amount of data. It can determine if an application meets performance requirements, locate bottlenecks, measure stability during peak traffic, etc. 

Within performance testing, **load testing** helps you to understand how the system behaves under an expected load, while **stress testing** helps you to  understand the upper limits of the system's capacity using a load beyond the expected maximum.
