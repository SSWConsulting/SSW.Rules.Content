There are many different types of testing, each designed to help mitigate different types of risk.

A good test strategy employs a combination of different types of testing, performed using an appropriate mix of human testing and automation.

Atlassian: unit, integration, functional, end-to-end, acceptance, performance, smoke

original: Confuses types of testing with testing techniques. 
Has: smoke, unit, integration, functional, subcutaneous, load, stress, test pyramid?!
Doesn’t mention consumer-driven contract testing explicitly

new: Define different types and why they’re different & important - intent of each type is to mitigate particular risks. Using different types attacks more types of risks.

Don't confuse test approaches & techniques (focused on the "how") with types of testing (the "what"). For example, [exploratory testing](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/what-is-exploratory-testing) - as an approach - applies well to several of the types of testing outlined above.
