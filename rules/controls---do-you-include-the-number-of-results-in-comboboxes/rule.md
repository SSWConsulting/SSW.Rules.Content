<p>When designing your form, you should try to help your user whenever it's possible. So it's a good idea to include the number of results in ComboBoxes.</p>

​<dl class="badImage"><dt><img alt="Options Form - ComboBox without Result Count" src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/ComboWF-1.jpg" /></dt>
<dd>Figure&#58; Bad Example - You can't tell the number of results and there is a scroll bar</dd></dl>
<dl class="goodImage"><dt><img alt="Options Form - ComboBox with Result Count" src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/ComboWF-2.jpg" /></dt>
<dd>Figure&#58; Good Example - The number of results is clearly displayed. Long text boxes &gt; 30 entries, another approach can be employed - putting the common ones at the top</dd></dl>
<dl class="badImage"><dt><img alt="Long Text ComboBox" src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/Rule38LongTextCombobox.jpg" /></dt>
<dd>Figure&#58; Bad Example - Firstly because it is manual, plus what about the 4th, 5th, etc most common used countries</dd></dl>
<dl class="badImage"><dt><img alt="Sortable ComboBox" src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/rule38SortableCombobox.jpg" /></dt>
<dd>Figure&#58; Bad Example – This was a highly unpopular method of the sorting and counting above</dd></dl>
<div>We believe all combos should be able to be sorted ascending/descending and by popularity asc/desc.</div>
