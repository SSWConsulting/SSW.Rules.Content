<span class='intro'> <p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​Why do web pages have &quot;Reset&quot; buttons? I have been entering forms on the web for more years than I care to remember, but have never needed to click this button. The worst thing is I have accidentally hit it a few times after - I have a habit of doing 3 things at once - it happens just after I have finished entering everything and click the first button.
