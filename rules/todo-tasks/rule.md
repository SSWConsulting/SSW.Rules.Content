When you have an idea for content or notice something content is missing and cannot be written straight away, it is important to document it. It should be done by adding the words "TODO:" followed by what you want to be added there.

### GitHub

For GitHub projects, [creating an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) using "TODO" as prefix is the preferred way.

### VS Code Extension

In VS Code, we recommend using the extension [Todo Tree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree). You can find TODOs and highlight them in open files.
