Carrying your laptop with the right stuff installed is not enough. 

 Not only software, carrying your own hardware and peripherals will save you hours one day: 

 Here are the things you should also physically carry:  
<!--endintro-->

* Business cards
* A network cable (optional)
* An extension cord (optional)
* A thumb drive on your keyring (a personal choice, but 16 GB is a good choice)
* An external hard drive (a personal choice, but 750 GB if a good choice if you have lots of 10+ GB VMs)
* Software DVD's (generally you can keep the .ISOs of MS Office and Visual Studio D:\DataSetup\ISOs\)
* Current brochures - Hand them out to interested clients
* [User story cards](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/standards/rules/RulesToBetterProjectManagementWithTFS.aspx#PrintedStoryCard) - These help Product owners create user stories
* [Evaluation forms](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/NETUG/UGEvaluationSurvey.aspx) - Ask for feedback if you did a presentation
* Even a textbook or two


We have one guy in our office who carries two bags, each weighing about 10 kgs. He is the SSW St. Bernard! \*

 If you need to quickly share something with your mate:

* Use a thumb drive that you carry as per <br>      [Rules to better Software Consultants - Carry a thumb drive](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=ba63bcc0-99b0-4bbf-a60d-9b04e0f0d9d7)
* Setup a wireless ad hoc network as per <br>      [http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/create-a-quick-ad-hoc-wireless-network-connection-between-two-computers-in-windows-vista/](http&#58;//www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/create-a-quick-ad-hoc-wireless-network-connection-between-two-computers-in-windows-vista/)


\* One of our mean guys put a house brick in the bottom a bag to see if he noticed it. He carried it for 2 weeks. It was very funny.
