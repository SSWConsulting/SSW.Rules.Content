Carrying your laptop with the right stuff installed is not enough.

Not only software, carrying your own hardware and peripherals will save you hours one day:

Here are the things you should also physically carry:

<!--endintro-->

* Business cards
* A network cable (optional)
* An extension cord (optional)
* A thumb drive on your keyring (a personal choice, but 16 GB is a good choice)
* An external hard drive (a personal choice, but 750 GB if a good choice if you have lots of 10+ GB VMs)
* Software DVD's (generally you can keep the .ISOs of MS Office and Visual Studio D:\DataSetup\ISOs\)
* Current brochures - Hand them out to interested clients
* User story cards - These help Product owners create user stories
* Evaluation forms - Ask for feedback if you did a presentation
* Even a textbook or two

We have one guy in our office who carries two bags, each weighing about 10 kgs. He is the SSW St. Bernard! \*

If you need to quickly share something with your mate:

* [Use a thumb drive](/do-you-carry-your-usb-flash-drive-on-your-key-ring)
* [Setup a wireless ad hoc network](http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/create-a-quick-ad-hoc-wireless-network-connection-between-two-computers-in-windows-vista/)

**Fun fact:** One of our mean guys put a house brick in the bottom a bag to see if he noticed it. He carried it for 2 weeks. It was very funny.
