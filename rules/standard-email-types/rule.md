All business emails (that are useful) should be in one of the 4 following formats:

<!--endintro-->

1. **FYI** - Used to spread information
    * [Daily Scrum](/methodology-do-you-do-daily-scrums-aka-stand-up-meetings) - Report on daily progress in a Sprint
    * Sprint Review/Retro emails
    * Sprint Planning emails, etc
2. **Tasks** - Used to send direct numbered tasks
    * [To Myself](/dones-do-you-send-yourself-emails) - to send yourself a task, and CC interested parties
    * Tasks to one or more other people
3. [**Test Please**](/conduct-a-test-please-internally-and-then-with-the-client) - Used to request testing and/or acceptance of a task
4. [**Done**](/dones-do-you-reply-done-and-delete-the-original-email) - Used when replying to a task, showing details of what has been done

If your email doesn't fit into one of the above categories, it probably doesn't need to be sent.
