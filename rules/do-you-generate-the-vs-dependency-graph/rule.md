Dependency graphs are important because they give you an indication of the coupling between the different components within your application.

A well architected application (ie. one that correctly follows the Onion Architecture) will be easy to maintain because it is loosely coupled.

<!--endintro-->

There are many tools to generate dependency graphs for your .NET projects. Each tool has its own pros and cons. Lets dive into dependency graphs generated by different tools look at their advantages and disadvantages.

### Option 1 - Rider

Generating dependency graph is easy with the Rider's built-in tool. Check the official [docs](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Architecture__Project_Dependencies_Exploration.html) for more information about dependency graphs in Rider.

### ✅ Pros

* **Dependency view** - The graph is more readable and organized
* **Dependency cycle** - It’s easy to track the dependencies of the project and determine underlying issues
* **Generation time** - The dependency graph generation is very fast
* **Interface** - The interaction with the graph feels very smoothly
* **Customizability** - It has beautiful menu in the left to select or deselect any project from the graph
* **Availability** - You don't require to install any extension into Rider or select any component when you are installing Rider, it is already available in the IDE

### ❌ Cons

* **Cost** - After 1 month trial, you will need license to continue using Rider
* **Cluttered view** - Complex projects require manual layout adjustments to make the graph readable (no advanced layout tools like Visual Studio has)
