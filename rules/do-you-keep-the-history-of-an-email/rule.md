<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Often we receive a reply to an email and it has one word - &quot;Yes.&quot; <br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">If the sender can't remember what was asked and the respondent has deleted the history, it's hard to tell what's going on. It's not possible to&#160;check whether all questions were answered, or what&#160;URL was in the original email.&#160;Also, we&#160;can't CC someone else on the new reply because the email is missing half the information.&#160;</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">So the only way is to go back into 'sent items', find what was asked&#160;for and copy and paste it into my reply, which can be very frustrating.<br></p>
