To reply to a bug effectively and efficiently in your emails, you need to include:

<!--endintro-->

- Current Status - the bug is fixed (screenshot of working application) or not fixed (ask for more detailed information from the client)
- Investigation - the reason for the bug, or if you don't know, what you investigated, e.g. checked Windows event logs and found nothing helpful
- Solution - how you fixed the bug (code snippet if necessary)
