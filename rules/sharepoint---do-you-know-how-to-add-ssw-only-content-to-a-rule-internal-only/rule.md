Select the element "SSW Internal Block" to show content only internally.


<!--endintro-->
<dl class="image">&lt;dt&gt; <img src="internal-only.jpg" alt="internal-only.jpg"> &lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: Use this "SSW Internal Block" style to insert a section for "SSW Only" content <br>
      <br></dd></dl><dl class="image">&lt;dt&gt;<img src="ssw-only-signedin.jpg" alt="ssw-only-signedin.jpg">&lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: When signed in, you can see "ssw only" content</dd></dl><dl class="image">&lt;dt&gt;<img src="ssw-only-signedoff.jpg" alt="ssw-only-signedoff.jpg">&lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: When signed off, you cannot  see "ssw only" content</dd></dl>
**Note:** We have "SSW only content block" feature, however, Rules.SSW is a public website, which means technically the content is accessible through API, so please do not use it for confidential or sensitive info.
