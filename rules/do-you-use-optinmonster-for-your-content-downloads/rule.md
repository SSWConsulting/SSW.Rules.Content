<span class='intro'> Content marketing is a great way to increase interest in your business and helps to improve lead generation.<br> </span>

<p style="text-align&#58;justify;">The best way to achieve this is to use gated content, which requires potential leads to provide their details in order to access the content offered. There are a number of platforms which allow you to create these forms and embed them onto your site.</p><p style="text-align&#58;justify;">&#160;</p><p style="text-align&#58;justify;">At SSW we did some research, and after initially using LeadPages, we decided to swap to OptinMonster. This choice was made for a few reasons, OptinMonster is significantly cheaper than LeadPages, and provides all the features we required including; form builders, pop-up forms, mobile friendly, A/B testing and tracking. &#160;<br></p><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><img src="Picture1.png" alt="Picture1.png" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;808px;" /></dl><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; Example of OptinMonster pop-up form on <a href="https&#58;//tv.ssw.com/">SSWTV </a><br></dd>
