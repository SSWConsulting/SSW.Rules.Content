Content marketing is a great way to increase interest in your business and helps to improve lead generation.<br>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The best way to achieve this is to use gated content, which requires potential leads to provide their details in order to access the content offered. There are a number of platforms which allow you to create these forms and embed them onto your site.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;">At SSW we did some research, and after initially using LeadPages, we decided to swap to OptinMonster. This choice was made for a few reasons, OptinMonster is significantly cheaper than LeadPages, and provides all the features we required including; form builders, pop-up forms, mobile friendly, A/B testing and tracking.  <br></p><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><img src="Picture1.png" alt="Picture1.png" style="margin:5px;width:808px;" /></dl><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureNormal">Figure: Example of OptinMonster pop-up form on <a href="https://tv.ssw.com/">SSWTV </a><br></dd>
