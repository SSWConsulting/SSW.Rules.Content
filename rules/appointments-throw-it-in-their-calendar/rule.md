One of the least successful ways to get an appointment is to ask for one.

<!--endintro-->

The better way to get an appointment with someone is to throw an appointment their way. You have a higher chance of it sticking if it appears in their calendar. You will be amazed at your success rate. That said, make sure you soften the appointment with the following (or similar) “if there is a better time for you, let me know”.

I have sent through a Teams meeting to catch up early next week. If the timing doesn’t work, let me know and I’ll update the appointment.

Best,
