Do you know to throw it in their calendar?

The lowest chance of getting an appointment is to ask.
     
The best way to get an appointment with someone, is just throw an appointment their way. No asking for the right time. You will be amazed at your success rate.
You have a high chance of it sticking. That said, make sure you soften the appointment with a line such as “if there is better time for you, let me know”
