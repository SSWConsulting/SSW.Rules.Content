Before you attend a meeting you must come prepared with details about the client; meaning no unnecessary questions. By unnecessary, I mean you should already have the answers to these questions. Extensive research is impressive to clients.

  <p>So you are talking to a client about their ice cream chain?</p>
<dl class="bad">
    <dt>How many outlets do you have? <br>
    Where is the main outlet? </dt>
    <dd>Figure&#58; Bad examples - you should already know the answers to these questions by use of research tools such as the Internet </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="good">
    <dt>I noticed you have x amount of outlets, are you planning to open up more, when and where?<br>
    Which of your products contribute most to your gross profit?<br>
    How do most of your customers hear about you?<br>
    Do you have a customer loyalty program? Is it working?<br>
    Where are some of the biggest challenges / opportunities for you at the moment / in the future? </dt>
    <dd>Figure&#58; Good Examples </dd>
</dl>
<p>By asking questions, you show interest as well as initiating conversation - remember to get the customer talking.</p>
<p>Look for points of pain and build on them - if there's no pain it's hard to fix the problem properly.<br>
<br>
Tip&#58; Google their name before the meeting. Customers' ears prick up when they hear that you googled them.</p>
