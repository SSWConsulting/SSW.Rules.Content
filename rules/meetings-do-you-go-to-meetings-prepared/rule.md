Before you attend a meeting you must come prepared with details about the client; meaning no unnecessary questions. By unnecessary, I mean you should already have the answers to these questions. Extensive research is impressive to clients.   
<!--endintro-->

So you are talking to a client about their ice cream chain?
      How many outlets do you have? 
     Where is the main outlet?      Figure: Bad examples - you should already know the answers to these questions by use of research tools such as the Internet        I noticed you have x amount of outlets, are you planning to open up more, when and where?
     Which of your products contribute most to your gross profit?
     How do most of your customers hear about you?
     Do you have a customer loyalty program? Is it working?
     Where are some of the biggest challenges / opportunities for you at the moment / in the future?      Figure: Good Examples   
By asking questions, you show interest as well as initiating conversation - remember to get the customer talking.

Look for points of pain and build on them - if there's no pain it's hard to fix the problem properly.

 Tip: Google their name before the meeting. Customers' ears prick up when they hear that you googled them.
