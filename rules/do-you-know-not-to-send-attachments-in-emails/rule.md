It's better to use links to a portal or document store instead of having attachments in your emails.

If you're sending to a fellow employee, use a link to a document store on your intranet (e.g. intranet.northwind.com/SharedDocuments)

If you're sending to a client, it would be a link to a document store on their [project portal](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=846474eb-27a1-4645-90ee-10a349fef714). (e.g. projects.northwind.com/SharedDocuments)

**Tip:** If you're using SharePoint, then an even better way to do this is to use a tool like OnePlaceMail to insert a link from SharePoint

Using the Document ID Feature in SharePoint will help minimise broken links under the following scenarios:

1. Company Restructures / SharePoint restructures
2. Records Management – when items are moved to the Record Centre

If you are using a shared DropBox, then put in a reference like so:
