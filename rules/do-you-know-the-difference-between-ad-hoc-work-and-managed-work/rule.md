When working on a Time and Materials basis there are two different management arrangements depending on what the client requires. 

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <p>
    <b>Ad Hoc Work</b> </p>
<p>Workin on an ad-hoc basis allows tasks to be done as they are requested without any formal approval process. This is a simple approach but provides little in the way of management or accountability. This may be suitable for ongoing work such as application maintenance with longstanding clients OR working under a client manager.</p>
<p>The ad-hoc work approach should not generally be used for project work where the client wants SSW to be manage project elements such as time, scope, quality and cost. <br>
<br>
An exception exists where SSW provides resources to work under a non-SSW project manager who has responsibility for the project. </p>
<p><b>SSW Managed Work</b></p>
<p>The alternative is to work with a project manager, specification and release plan. In this approach, a method of project management is applied to provide control on the elements of time, scope, quality and cost. </p>
<p>This method is recommended for any work which is substantial and where the client wants a greater degree of control. </p>
<p>The <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulestoSuccessfulSalesAccountManagement.aspx#OutcomeInitialMeetingSpecRevieworAdHocWork">managed approach</a> is SSW's prefer method of work.</p>
