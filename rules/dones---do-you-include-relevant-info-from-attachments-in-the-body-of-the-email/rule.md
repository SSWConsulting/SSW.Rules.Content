<p>When someone sends you a .doc file or images that are attached when you reply 'done' they (and others CCed) won't be able to see the appropriate history. If it is a word .doc or an image; open it and&#160;copy and paste the text/image into the history, where the image should have been. Don't leave it as an attachment.&#160;<br></p>

<p><strong>Warning&#58;&#160;</strong>iPhones strip inline images. If someone has replied to a beautifully crafted email (with inline images) with their iPhone, it will now be a clipped plain text email&#160;with your image as an attachment and would not be included in the &quot;Reply All&quot;...Grrrr<br></p><p>So in such a case, you will want to skip that email and go back to the last HTML email and paste in the extra response. For clarity, add something like&#58;<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox"><span class="ssw15-rteStyle-Highlight">&quot;(fixed history to put back images - caused by Adam's iPhone)&quot;​</span></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Related&#160;​Rule​​​​<br></h3><p></p><ul><li><a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=0068ccf3-e94e-47c6-832b-aea059a3d873">Do you keep the history of an email?​​</a>​<br></li></ul>
