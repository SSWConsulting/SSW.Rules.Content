<span class='intro'> SharePoint 2010 and Office 2010 ships with a fantastic document management feature &quot;Managed Metadata Service&quot;. This new service provides first class support for enterprise taxonomy within a standard SharePoint 2010 environment. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, Office 2007 and Office 2003 can't work with managed metadata fields out of the box. <br>
 </span>

<ol>Office 2010&#58; 
   <li>Works fine </li></ol><ol>Office 2007&#58; 
   <li>Document information can't display managed metadata </li><li>You can still save documents to SharePoint </li><li>But you can't check-in (if metadata fields are required) </li><li>User needs to perform a web check-in </li></ol><ol>Office 2003&#58; 
   <li>Can't create new or Open documents with managed metadata </li><li>Install Office 2007 document support upgrade, this bring the experience a bit better similar to Office 2007. </li></ol>&#160;<span style="color&#58;black;"><br> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br> </span><p>Best Solution&#58;<br> 
   <br> Use a 3rd party solution - the best one being OnePlaceMail which provides a UI for managed metadata via the &quot;Save to SharePoint&quot;. Works with all three versions of Office so users get a consistent UI.
