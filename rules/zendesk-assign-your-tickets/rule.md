One of the advantages of Zendesk (and other ticketing systems) is that requests go to a number of people, but one person is assigned. This stops requests getting blocked as anyone can pick it up - but there is also ownership once it is assigned.

To avoid two people working on a ticket at the same time, you should assign a ticket to yourself **before** you start working on it.
