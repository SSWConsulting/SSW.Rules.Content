Before a meeting, to give it the best chance of success, you should make sure you have done the following:
* Create a meeting agenda prior to the meeting. Give each attendee a copy (usually in the appointment). If the discussion strays from the topic, the agenda will help you keep it on track.
  * Possibly mark items on the agenda as “For information,” “For discussion,” or “For decision”.
* Send an appointment to all meeting attendees to ensure the meeting appears on their calendar.
* The Meeting starts the minute the invite is sent, not when it physically starts. For example if you need feedback on a large document, you can give people advanced warning that you will be taking their feedback during the meeting, and they need to review it ahead of time.
* Make sure all the presentation setup is working. Please refer to the SugarLearning item '[AV Setup Teams Meetings](https://my.sugarlearning.com/SSW/items/13053/av-setup-for-microsoft-teams-meetings-sydney-chapel)'.
* For attendees, if you are going to be late, contact the organizer or the person in charge of the meeting to let them know that you are running late and what time you will be arriving.
