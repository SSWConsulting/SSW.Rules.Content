Before a meeting, to give it the best chance of success, you should make sure you have done the following:

<!--endintro-->

* Create a meeting agenda prior to the meeting

  * Give each attendee a copy (usually in the appointment) 
  * If the discussion strays from the topic, everyone should use the agenda to help keep it on track
  * Possibly [mark items on the agenda as “For information,” “For discussion,” or “For decision”](/stick-to-the-agenda-and-complete-the-meetings-goal)
* Send an appointment to all meeting attendees to ensure the meeting appears on their calendar.
* The meeting starts the minute the invite is sent, not when it physically starts.\
  That means read the agenda and prepare. For example if feedback is needed on a large document, give people the link to the document + give advanced warning that  their feedback on the document will be taken ahead of time.
* Make sure all the presentation setup is working.\
  E.g. For SSW they have a '[AV Setup Teams Meetings](https://my.sugarlearning.com/SSW/items/13053/av-setup-for-microsoft-teams-meetings-sydney-chapel)'.
* For attendees, if you are going to be late, contact the organizer or the person in charge of the meeting to let them know that you are running late and what time you will be arriving.

### Hi Team,

This is a calendar appointment to hold the following three Scrum meetings:

**Sprint Review Meeting** 
We will go through the user stories that have been completed and demonstrate them.
See rule [What happens at a Sprint Review Meeting](/do-you-know-what-happens-at-a-sprint-review-meeting)? 

**Sprint Retrospective Meeting** 
Sprint closed and new sprint starts.
We ask for feedback of the previous sprint so that we can ‘Inspect and Adapt’.
See rule [What happens at a Sprint Retrospective Meeting](/do-you-know-what-happens-at-a-sprint-retrospective-meeting)? 

**Sprint Planning Meeting** 
We go through the backlog (aka to-do list), get more information, estimate and then prioritize. 
We then breakdown to tasks and commit to what we believe we can deliver for the next sprint.
See the rule [What happens at a Sprint Planning Meeting](/do-you-know-what-happens-at-a-sprint-planning-meeting)?

Regards,
\[Scrum Master]

&lt;This email is as per the rule [https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/scrum-master-do-you-schedule-the-3-meetings](/scrum-master-do-you-schedule-the-3-meetings) /&gt;
