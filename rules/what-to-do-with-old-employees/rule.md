<span class='intro'> When migrating from TFS to the cloud you will find that a list of historical users may be quite long.<br> </span>

<dl class="image"><dt>​​<img src="old-employees-to-the-cloud.jpg" alt="old-employees-to-the-cloud.jpg" />​​<span style="color&#58;#555555;font-size&#58;0.9rem;font-weight&#58;bold;">Figure&#58; TFS Identity Mapping​</span>​</dt></dl><p>Many of these users are likely to be gone but they are preserved in TFS for historical purposes. What are you going to do with them?&#160;<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>A) </b>All account stays active (total 700 in AD) – this is a hard one because you need to bring all accounts in Azure AD and generally you don’t need those users<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
   <b>B)&#160; </b>Old employees are carried over as phantom&#160; (so only 40 are migrated) – Recommended because you will still see the history but not those accounts are not active anymore<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Eg. If Paul Stovell comes back he needs a new account (because you can't reuse the SID)<br></p>
