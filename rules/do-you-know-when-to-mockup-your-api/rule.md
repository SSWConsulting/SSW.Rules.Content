Designing your API up front can be very useful where you have a significant amount of backend development to complete before there is sufficient functionality for front end development to easily commence. 
<!--endintro-->
Rather than waiting for the backend to be complete, the APIs can be agreed up front. Tools like **Azure API Management** then allow you to mock up the APIs with sample data, allowing the front end development to commence much sooner.  
 This can result in valuable feedback on the API and backend functionality much earlier in your development lifecycle. The key benefit is being able to present the frontend to stakeholders for feedback really early.  


Watch Adam Cogan and William Liebenberg discuss the benefits.
