<span class='intro'> <p>So you had a good initial meeting (like a 1st coffee with a new girl), and you have agreed to have a Specification Review (aka first date).​</p><p>For the majority of new clients, a&#160;<a href="/spec-do-you-conduct-a-specification-review-(ask-for-a-coffee-not-a-marriage)">Specification Review</a>&#160;(also known as a Spec Review) will be your 1st paid engagement with them,&#160;<span style="line-height&#58;20.799999237060547px;">and&#160;gives&#160;the client a <a href="/Pages/Aim-for-an-advancement-rather-than-a-continuance.aspx">smaller first commitment</a>​.</span>&#160;This is to work out the requirements&#160;and&#160;put together a broad time and cost estimate.</p><p>It is a simple&#160;4 step process&#58;</p> </span>


<ol><li>​Once you have decided that this is a project you want to work on, you have to convince the client to book in a Spec Review <ul><li>This is a 1-5 day exercise for 1-2 people. The general rule is 1 man day per expected 2 week sprint.</li>
<li>This process is timeboxed, and so appears to the client as a fixed price.</li></ul></li>
<li>Make sure you get <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/standards/forms/ConsultingOrderTermsConditions.aspx">Terms and C​onditions</a> signed before you start work on this.</li>
<li><a href="/rules">Specification Review</a> -&#160;You will create a backlog of tasks, and some form of document (word or ppt) to present to the client explaining your proposed approach.

<li>Present the Spec Review results to the client (in a meeting with all stakeholders) on site if possible, or over the phone if not, but never just by email.</li></ol>
