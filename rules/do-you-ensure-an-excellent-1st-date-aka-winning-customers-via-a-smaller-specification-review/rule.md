<span class='intro'> <p>So you had a good initial meeting (like a 1st coffee with a new girl), and you have agreed to have a Specification Review (aka first date).</p> </span>

<p>For the majority of new clients, a <a href="/Management/RulesToBetterProjectManagement/Pages/SpecificationReview.aspx">Specification Review</a> (also known as a Spec Review) will be your 1st paid engagement with them. This is to work out the requirements, and put together a broad time and cost estimate.</p>
<p>The process&#58;</p>
<ol><li>Once you have decided that this is a project you want to work on, you have to convince the client to book in a Spec Review <ul><li>This is a 1-5 day exercise for 1-2 people. The general rule is 1 man day per expected 2 week sprint.</li>
<li>This process is timeboxed, and so appears to the client as a fixed price.</li></ul></li>
<li>Make sure you get <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/standards/forms/ConsultingOrderTermsConditions.aspx">terms and conditions</a> signed before you start work on this.</li>
<li>You will create a backlog of tasks, and some form of document (word or ppt) to present to the client explaining your proposed approach.</li>
<li>Present the Spec Review results to the client (in a meeting with all stakeholders) on site if possible, or over the phone if not, but never just by email.</li></ol>
