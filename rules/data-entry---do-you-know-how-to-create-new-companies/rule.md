Although you can create a Contact first, it's better to always create the Company first so you don't get orphan Contacts.

 **Tip #1:** Avoid duplicates - Make sure that there is no existing company before you make the entry.

 **Tip #2:** Generally you should be [creating these from leads](/Pages/Leads-can-be-converted-to-Opportunities-Contacts-and-Accounts.aspx), as it speeds up the process.
