<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<div><strong>Configuration</strong> applies to any changes made to application settings that help to make your TFS installation work correctly for a particular environment</div><div><br></div><div>Configuration would apply to objects like&#58; TFS Administration Console (SharePoint, Microsoft Test Manager (MTM), Visual Studio, Web Access, Lab Management integration),&#160;User Security, Check-in options.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Customization </strong>is when TFS is changed to&#160;fit into a customized process.&#160;</div><div><br></div><div>Customization would apply to&#58; Changing&#160;Work Item Templates, Custom Reports, Workflow and using the API to connect to other systems.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Extending </strong>is a term used with CRM that includes developing Plug-in's.
