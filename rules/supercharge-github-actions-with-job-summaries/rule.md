There have been a huge reuqest for Markdown for the GitHub Actions. Especially when running a series of tests, it's so good to see how many passed or failed at a glance rather than digging through hundreds of lines of log output. You can now generate and group custom Markdown content on the Actions and publish them as a job summary.

Custom Markdown content can be used for a variety of creative purposes, such as:

* Aggregating and displaying test results
* Generating reports
* Custom output independent of logs
