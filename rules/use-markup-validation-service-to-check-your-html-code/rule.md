**Markup Validation Service** allows you to check your web page against the W3C recommendations. When developing web pages you want to create a clean and valid web page. It makes it easier for someone else to read and add new parts to a web page. Every web language like HTML has its own syntax it must follow in order to produce a clean and valid web page, **Markup Validation Service** allows you to achieve that goal.
