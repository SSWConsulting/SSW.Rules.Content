Usually when an employee from the company wants to make a decision about either a naming convention, a button style, using user-controls or forms, or even something as simple as changing a font; there should always be reassurance from the rest of the team that it should/should not be done.

<ol>
    <li>The subject should start with "VOTE: ..." </li>
    <li>The sender should reply with a summary after either everyone has replied or after a certain period of time to let the group know how significant their input was. </li>
    <li>The voting options should be short, to the point, and provide a distinct difference for each option.<br>
    i.e. option1;"option1";option2;"option2" is not appropriate. </li>
    <li>There should also be an extra option to allow a flexible result if a member of the email group does not want to vote. i.e. yes; no; un-opinionated.<br>
    This will provide an accurate result of the vote and will not force anyone to select an option just for the sake of giving a reply. </li>
    <li>Voters should be allowed to add their extra comments along with their vote when replying to all, regardless of whether or not they think it is their "two cents", simply because the person who initially voted is looking for any and all opinions to assure the right decision is made. </li>
    <li>When making a vote, try to make the options clear enough so that voters would not have to spend too much time deciding.<br>
    A good voting system is one that allows the voters to choose an option quickly and carry on with their work, unless of course it is controversial. </li>
