<span class='intro'> Usually when an employee from the company wants to make a decision about either a naming convention, a button style, using user-controls or forms, or even something as simple as changing a font; there should always be reassurance from the rest of the team that it should/should not be done. 
<br> </span>

<ol>
    <li>The subject should start with &quot;VOTE&#58; ...&quot; </li>
    <li>The sender should reply with a summary after either everyone has replied or after a certain period of time to let the group know how significant their input was. </li>
    <li>The voting options should be short, to the point, and provide a distinct difference for each option.<br>
    i.e. option1;&quot;option1&quot;;option2;&quot;option2&quot; is not appropriate. </li>
    <li>There should also be an extra option to allow a flexible result if a member of the email group does not want to vote. i.e. yes; no; un-opinionated.<br>
    This will provide an accurate result of the vote and will not force anyone to select an option just for the sake of giving a reply. </li>
    <li>Voters should be allowed to add their extra comments along with their vote when replying to all, regardless of whether or not they think it is their &quot;two cents&quot;, simply because the person who initially voted is looking for any and all opinions to assure the right decision is made. </li>
    <li>When making a vote, try to make the options clear enough so that voters would not have to spend too much time deciding.<br>
    A good voting system is one that allows the voters to choose an option quickly and carry on with their work, unless of course it is controversial. </li>
</ol>
