When working remotely, you should be sharing your screen whenever discussing changes to a document or software. This allows your colleague or client to see changes that are happening on the screen, making the remote collaboration experience much nicer.

<!--endintro-->

When you first share your screen, make sure the other person can see your screen before you start talking about it. Often it takes a little while for the image to appear. The same if a new participant joins the call.

For a list of our recommended screen sharing tools, please check the [SSW rules for remote support](/do-you-know-the-best-way-to-give-the-best-customer-support).

Another good practice that follows on from this, is to leave a Teams/Zoom session open if you are working with the same person for the whole day. This eliminates the need to call your programming partner every time you have a query or question to ask.
