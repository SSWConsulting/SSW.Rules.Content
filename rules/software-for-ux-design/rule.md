There are a few options when it comes to the best software for UI/UX design (the creation of mockups and prototypes in particular). The most popular are:

- Figma (recommended)
- Adobe XD
- Sketch

::: greybox  
**Warning:** Sketch is available only on MacOS

Figma is the design tool of choice as it's highly collaborative, accessible, cloud-based and auto-saving, and comes with a huge suite of helpful design tools. The unique auto-layout feature helps designers craft highly responsive products in a way that reflects actual CSS properties like grids and flexbox, easing the transition between design and development.

**Figure: Figma helps designers bring ideas to life in a wireframe or prototype.**

The goal of any designer is to develop the best UI and develop the best user experience possible, and you want the best tool to help achieve this across 
web and mobile applications. Figma allows universal changes using a library of reusable components, text, colour and layer styles. 

**Note:** One software doesn't alwasys replace the others! **Figma** does not include the print design and photo editing features of **Adobe Photoshop** and other software also used by designers. Photoshop is the industry standard in raster (pixel-based) graphics editing, photography, and digital art. **Adobe Illustrator**, on the other hand, is the standard vector-based design tool used for print design, logos,icons, and more. All of these tools are important parts of a designer's kit!
