A great way of collaborating with a team or presenting a new solution to a client is using a visual display of your recommendations.

Using a whiteboard is a great way of collaborating and brainstorming which works quite well. But a physical whiteboard is a large ugly object that takes up a fair amount of room, often isn’t kept clean, and doesn’t allow for people to collaborate remotely. There are modern alternatives that work even better, let's have a look at them.

**Scenario:** Software consultants often use architecture diagrams to present a solution to the client. These graphical representations are used to help all of the stakeholders, the developers, the designers, and the clients visualize the high-level structure of the system or application to ensure it covers all of the client requirements.

### \#1A Casting your screen (recommended - non collaborative) ⭐️

If you are in a situation where you just need to show someone what you are doing then you can use your laptop or iPad and cast it to a monitor or a remote screen.

### \#1B Teams Whiteboard (recommended for remote collaboration) ⭐️

There are 2 ways to open the Teams Whiteboard:

1. In video chat the **Share Icon | Whiteboard**
2. In Teams chat window **Click + | Whiteboard**

### \#3 Paper Whiteboard (Low tech – a large piece of paper)

Old school but it is great to have a pen in hand, you can always just grab a big piece of paper and draw on it together.

Bear in mind that paper is not ideal because you can’t wipe it out... you have to start again #ouch

### \#4 Whiteboard and marker - Low tech (ugly)

The traditional whiteboard.

Quote from Adam Cogan (apparently not a fan of whiteboards in a tech office):

> I believe whiteboards are a sign of an old office… and they are ugly. They’re not a sign of a modern office.
> Sometimes they are useful and I know some people really like them (generally older people).
> I have seen the digital whiteboards (usually targeted at teachers) but I think they are horrible to use.
> The common scenario is for a Spec Review. I am always happy when I see devs using their device and casting to the TV. And the subsequent notes get saved to Microsoft Teams.

### \#5 Writable wall - Low tech (ugly)

Low tech (ugly) – Paint a wall to be writable or put some writable film on an office glass wall

### Suggestions for sketching software

There are many apps that allow you to sketch what you're talking about e.g.:

- PowerPoint
- Visio
- OneNote
- [Mural](https://mural.co/) (collaborative app)
- [Miro](https://miro.com/) (whiteboard app)
- Microsoft Teams Whiteboard
- Microsoft Whiteboard
- diagrams.net (was draw.io) ⭐️ - often collaborative sketches generated above enable the creation of a beautiful architecture diagram ([Do you make awesome documentation?](/do-you-review-the-documentation))

**Note:** These work fine with a mouse, they work even better with touch screens, or pens/styluses
