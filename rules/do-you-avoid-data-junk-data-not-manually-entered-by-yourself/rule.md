When there are too many choices always Default to the most common ones.  Then add a check box to allow the advanced users to turn off the common  choices. E.g.

<!--endintro-->


::: greybox
 [x] Only include common choices 
:::


Likewise in a contacts database where you have entries from all around the world it is good to add a check box on the search screen similar to the following:


::: greybox
[x] Only include customers that have been updated by employees (not directly entered from the web)
:::


A good example on that the checkbox on the search screen of TimePRO.NET.
<dl class="goodImage">&lt;dt&gt; 
      <img alt="Options Form - ComboBox without Result Count" src="../../assets/DefaultSearch.gif" style="margin:5px;"> 
   &lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: Default search tick box in TimePRO.NET</dd></dl>
