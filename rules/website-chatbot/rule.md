A chatbot is a computer program that uses artificial intelligence to engage in text or voice conversations with users, often to answer questions, provide assistance, or automate tasks. In the age of AI, good chatbots have become a necessary part of the User Experience. 

But what distinguishes a good chatbot from a great one? It's not just about automated responses; it's about intelligence and efficiency.

|          | GPT Integration                                          | Customization                | Pricing                     |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Botpress | ❌ Traditional style of workflow and steep learning curve | ✅ Wide range of integrations | ✅ Free to start             |
| Chatbase | ✅ Does everything with prompt engineering                | ✅ Easy customization         | ❌ Limited free plan options |

### Making the right choice

While both platforms offer unique features, Chatbase stands out as the superior choice in most instances. Here's why:

* Chatbase allows easy customization and integration with various tools
* Chatbase's user-friendly interface makes it accessible to a wide range of users. A prompt engineer can setup, tweak and improve the system. No development required
* Botpress lacks the intuitive interface of Chatbase, and is more prone non-sequeter conversation without extensive workflow development and testing

When selecting the best chatbot for your website, consider your specific needs and preferences. While Botpress offers a wide range of features, Chatbase's ease of customization, user-friendly interface, and robust GPT integration make it the superior choice for most users. 

Evaluate your requirements and choose the platform that best aligns with your goals.
