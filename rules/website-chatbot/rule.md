|          | GPT Integration                                          | Customization                | Pricing                     |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Botpress | ❌ Traditional style of workflow and steep learning curve | ✅ Wide range of integrations | ✅ Free to start             |
| Chatbase | ✅ Does everything with prompt engineering                | ✅ Easy customization         | ❌ Limited free plan options |

### Making the right choice

While both platforms offer unique features, Chatbase stands out as the superior choice in most instances. Here's why:

* Chatbase allows easy customization and integration with various tools
* Chatbase's user-friendly interface makes it accessible to a wide range of users. A prompt engineer can setup, tweak and improve the system. No development required
* Botpress lacks the intuitive interface of Chatbase, and is more prone non-sequeter conversation without extensive worflow development and testing

When selecting the best chatbot for your website, consider your specific needs and preferences. While Botpress offers a wide range of features, Chatbase's ease of customization, user-friendly interface, and robust GPT integration make it the superior choice for most users. 

Evaluate your requirements and choose the platform that best aligns with your goals.
