When sending an appointment, choose a clear and informative subject, so key details are visible at a glance. This helps people quickly understand the purpose without needing to open the appointment.

## Meeting request

If the appointment is a meeting request you should include the **names of the persons attending** that appointment.

## Flight bookings

For flight bookings, include at least the **passenger name** and **flight number**. To improve clarity, add the **origin**, **destination**, and **departure date and time** in the subject. The location should have the airport name. If relevant, include the terminal number in the location as well.

**Tip:** Use the emoji ✈️ for extra clarity.
