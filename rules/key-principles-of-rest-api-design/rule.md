REST APIs are everywhere in our daily livesâ€”from social media updates and online shopping to weather forecasts and GPS navigation. These interfaces allow different applications to connect seamlessly, providing the backbone for countless modern conveniences.

Building a high-quality API means adhering to best practices that enhance clarity, reliability, and security, creating a more consistent experience for developers and users.

**Video: Good APIs Vs Bad APIs: 7 Tips for API Design (6 min)**

## Tip \#1 - Use clear naming  

Choose descriptive, intuitive names for endpoints and parameters to improve readability. Adhere to REST conventions, using nouns and verbs logically (e.g., `/api/users` for accessing user data, `/api/users/{id}` for specific user information). Endpoints should also use plurals. i.e `/api/users` instead of `/api/user`. This provides a much more consistent API structure when querying both collections and single entities.

Clear naming simplifies usage and reduces misunderstandings.  

## Tip \#2 - Ensure reliability through idempotency  

To avoid unintended actions from repeated requests, design POST, PUT, and DELETE operations as idempotent, where repeating an action yields the same result as performing it once.

For example, if a DELETE request removes a record, re-sending it should not throw errors if the record is already deleted.

This prevents accidental duplicate data processing.  

## Tip \#3 - Implement versioning  

Introduce versioning from the start (e.g., `/v1/resource`) to maintain backward compatibility when updating the API.

Versioning helps users manage changes without breaking existing implementations, allowing them to adopt new features gradually.  

## Tip \#4 - Add pagination for responses  

For endpoints that return lists, apply pagination to prevent overwhelming the client with too much data.

When paging parameters are omitted from the request, the API should apply some sensible defaults (e.g. page 1, 50 records).

Use query parameters like ?page= and ?limit= to specify page numbers and size, offering a more manageable data experience while improving performance.  

## Tip \#5 - Use clear query strings for sorting  

When supporting sorting, apply clear query strings (e.g., `?sortBy=name&order=asc`). Query params should generally be optional making the API easier to consume.

Consistent sorting parameters allow developers to retrieve and organize data efficiently and minimize confusion in handling API responses.  

## Tip \#6 - Security should not be an afterthought

Security is paramount in API design. Pass sensitive information, like access tokens, securely via headers (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer {token}`).  

Common security headers should also be considered:  
* Content-Security-Policy (CSP)  
* Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)  
* X-Content-Type-Options  
* X-Frame-Options  

Enforce HTTPS for encrypted communication and consider OAuth for user authentication and authorization, protecting against unauthorized access.  

## Tip \#7 - Keep cross-resource references simple

For APIs that reference multiple resources (e.g., `userId` in a post endpoint), keep relationships simple to prevent over-complicating endpoints.

Provide clear references or IDs rather than nested data whenever possible to keep API responses readable and easy to follow.  

For example, aovoid using messy query patameters such as `api/products?user_id=123&product_id=321`. Instead, use clearly defined endpoints like `api/users/123/products/321`.

## Extra tip - Rate limiting  

Implement rate limiting to control the number of requests per user within a time frame, protecting the API from abuse and ensuring fair resource usage.

Provide appropriate status codes and messages (e.g., `HTTP 429`) when limits are reached to inform users clearly.

Following these guidelines ensures your API is well-structured, secure, and developer-friendly.
Thoughtful API design not only improves functionality but also fosters trust and ease of use for everyone who interacts with it.
