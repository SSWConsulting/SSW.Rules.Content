This cannot be stressed enough. The venue for your event is the absolute most important item to get right and to get locked in.

<!--endintro-->

An ideal venue should be addressing all of the following

* Be able to accommodate the desired amount of people
* Offer appropriate audio and visual equipment for the talks, such as microphones, projectors and power sources
* Is there Wi-Fi available? If not, what is your backup plan (if any)
* Be within budgetary constraints (see rule "Have you got an adequate budget")


Securing the venue as early as possible on the right date allows you to

* Book in speakers – They can lock in the engagement
* Announce the venue
* Determine capacity – You now know how many attendees you can accommodate
* Start promoting the event
* Determine what approximate budget is needed
