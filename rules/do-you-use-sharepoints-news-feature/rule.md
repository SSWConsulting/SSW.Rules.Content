Sharing the news is a great way to update the team about important updates, announcements, and articles. While some companies choose to send an email to the whole organization, SharePoint's News feature provides a better way to disseminate information effectively and engage your team members.

### Accessing the News feature:

1. Navigate to SharePoint and locate the "My News" section on the left side of the page.
2. If you're using the News feature for the first time:
  - Select "Create news post" to create a new post from scratch.
  - Alternatively, you can select a news post from the previous month and click the "+ New" button, followed by "Copy of this News Post" to duplicate the content.

### Updating the news post:

1. Once you're in the News post editor, update the date to reflect the current or intended publication date.
2. Enter your news content in the provided text editor. Be clear, concise, and engaging in your writing, keeping in mind the target audience for the news post.
3. You can use formatting options such as headings, bullet points, bold or italic text to enhance the readability and visual appeal of your news post.
4. Consider including relevant images, videos, or attachments to provide additional context or resources, if necessary.
5. Proofread your news post for any spelling or grammatical errors before publishing.
6. Imform the company that the news is ready by clicking the "Send To" button located on the news site. 

### Maintaining consistent site naming:

1. Once you have saved the news post, click the settings icon in the top right corner of the SharePoint page.
2. From the dropdown menu, select "Site Contents" and then click on "Site Pages" to access the page listing.
3. Locate your news post file within the list and select it.
4. Click on the "Rename" option to change the file name.
5. Follow a consistent naming convention, such as using the format "The-SSW-Times-YYYY-MM" (e.g., The-SSW-Times-2023-05).
6. Ensure that the file name reflects the content of the news post and includes relevant identifiers, such as the title or date.

## Benefits of using SharePoint's News feature over emailing the news:

* Enhanced visibility and discoverability: SharePoint's News feature provides a centralized platform where team members can easily access and find the latest news posts. Instead of burying important information in email inboxes, news posts are readily available within the SharePoint site.

* Structured and organized content: News posts in SharePoint can be formatted using headings, bullet points, and multimedia elements. This allows for a more visually appealing and organized presentation of information, making it easier for readers to digest and understand.

* Engagement and collaboration: SharePoint's News feature encourages interaction and collaboration among team members. Readers can leave comments, ask questions, or provide feedback directly on the news post, fostering a sense of community and promoting active engagement.

* Version control and archiving: With SharePoint, you can easily maintain a version history of your news posts. This allows you to track changes, revert to previous versions if needed, and keep a comprehensive record of past announcements or updates.

* Analytics and insights: SharePoint provides analytics and usage data, allowing you to track the reach and engagement of your news posts. You can gain insights into the number of views, comments, and reactions, helping you gauge the effectiveness and relevance of your communications.

* Integration with Power BI: SharePoint's News feature enables the embedding of Power BI reports or dashboards directly into news posts. This integration allows you to present data-driven insights and visualizations alongside your news updates, enhancing the understanding and impact of the information shared.
