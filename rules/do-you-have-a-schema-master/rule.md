<span class='intro'> You have a web site master right? This is the central point of contact if the site goes down.<br>
When developing an application, all members can code. However schema changes being done by many developers often can lead to trouble. <br>
<br>
Who&#160;is &quot;Schema Master&quot;? What does he do?

<p style="margin&#58;0cm 0cm 0pt;">If your project has a database, you need to select a &quot;Schema Master&quot;. This is the one person who should review all&#160;modifications to the database. These include&#58;</p>

    <li>Creating, Modifying and Deleting tables and columns </li>
    <li>Relationships </li>

The &quot;Schema Master&quot; in a development shop is often the lead programmer on the team. They are&#160;in charge of all database changes and scripts. Team members should still feel free to make changes, just get them double checked by the Schema Master.<dl class="image">
