AI tools like ChatGPT are fantastic for speeding up your work, whether you're drafting emails, reports, LinkedIn posts, or documentation. But while these tools are great at generating content quickly, they’re not always great at *sounding human*. Left unchecked, AI-generated text can come across as overly formal, overly dramatic, or just a bit fake.


<!--endintro-->


Before hitting send, take a minute to review the content ChatGPT gave you. It can save you from sounding robotic.


Here are the most common issues to watch out for:


## Overly Formal Tone


AI often leans toward formality, making everyday points sound like a lawyer or English literature. This can feel unnatural, especially in a casual email or chat.


::: greybox 
Common examples:
- “plays a vital role”
- “holds significant importance”
- “a crucial influence”
- “a profound heritage”
:::
::: bad  
Bad Example – These phrases sound heavy-handed for most day-to-day writing  
:::


Instead, use simpler alternatives that sound more like what you'd say in conversation.


## Promotional or Marketing Language


ChatGPT sometimes slips into writing that sounds like an ad, even when you’re not selling anything. This usually means lots of positive adjectives with no real facts.


::: greybox 
Typical AI phrases include:
- “continues to captivate”
- “boasts a…”
- “seamlessly connecting…”
- “value-driven experiences…”
:::
::: bad  
Bad Example – Sounds polished, but it’s just fluff with no substance  
:::


Stick to facts. If something is great, show *why* it’s great—don’t just say it is.


## Unnecessary Drama or Parallelisms


AI loves to add contrast for dramatic effect, especially when it isn’t needed. These sentence structures often look polished but can feel exaggerated when overused.


::: greybox  
Common AI patterns include:  
- “It’s not just X—it’s Y.”  
- “Not only… but also…”  
- “However…” (followed by a sweeping generalization)  
:::
::: bad  
Bad Example – Overuse of dramatic structures makes writing feel artificial or emotionally loaded  
:::






## Fake or Vague Analysis


ChatGPT can invent explanations that *sound* deep, but actually say nothing. Phrases like:


::: greybox
- “highlighting…”
- “emphasizing…”
- “underscoring…”
- “contributing to…”
:::
::: bad  
Bad Example – Sounds analytical, but adds no real value or evidence  
:::


If ChatGPT adds analysis, ask yourself: *Is this actually true? Do I have evidence for this?* If not, cut it.


## Emojis in Professional Writing


Emojis are fun, but they rarely belong in professional documents, reports, or client-facing communication.

🚨 Underlying Motivation:  
🧭 What You’re Actually Dealing With:
:::
::: bad  
Bad Example – Emojis make the writing feel unprofessional  
:::


Use tone and structure—not emojis—to express nuance.


## Too Many Em Dashes (—)


AI uses em dashes excessively. Humans usually prefer commas or parentheses in most cases.


::: greybox
Elwandore is a place to build, to create, and to grow — but not for greed — for giving.

::: bad  
Bad Example – Too many em dashes make it feel unnatural

### Final Tips


✅ **Keep the good stuff.** ChatGPT often produces solid drafts and saves time.  
🚫 **Don't blindly copy and paste.** Review tone, phrasing, and accuracy first.  
🔍 **Ask yourself: “Would I say it this way?”** If not, rewrite it.


By taking the time to edit and humanize ChatGPT's output, you'll sound more authentic, approachable, and clear.
