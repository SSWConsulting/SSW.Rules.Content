ChatGPT can be extremely helpful for writing. It’s great for drafting emails, reports, and all kinds of documents. At SSW, we encourage everyone to use it as a practical tool to speed up their work.
However, AI-generated text can sometimes sound too formal or unintentionally rude. So it’s worth checking the tone before sending it out.
Here are a few common issues to look out for:

## Overly Formal Tone
AI often sounds more serious or “important” than necessary.
It tends to turn simple ideas into something that feels big or grand, even when the topic is ordinary.

::: greybox 
Common examples:
•	“plays a vital role”
•	“holds significant importance”
•	“a crucial influence”
•	“a profound heritage”
These phrases make the writing feel heavier than it needs to be.

## Promotional Language
AI sometimes slips into a style that sounds like advertising or tourism marketing.
It adds emotional or positive wording without giving any evidence.

Typical AI phrases include:
•	continues to captivate
•	boasts a…
•	TTDC acts as the gateway to Tamil Nadu’s diverse attractions, seamlessly connecting the beginning and end of every traveller's journey. It offers dependable, value-driven experiences that showcase the state’s rich history, spiritual heritage, and natural beauty.

These phrases sound nice, but they’re basically opinions and can make the writing feel biased or overly dramatic.

## Negative Parallelisms
AI loves using patterns like:
•	“not only … but …”
•	“it’s not just … it’s …”
•	big dramatic “however” statements
These structures create a sense of drama or contrast that isn’t always needed. They can make the writing feel exaggerated or unnatural.


## Superficial or Made-Up Analysis
AI often adds sentences that sound analytical but don’t actually say anything meaningful.
It may act like it’s explaining something, but the explanation is usually vague or completely invented.
These statements usually don’t have real evidence behind them and often treat things (like buildings or events) as if they can “highlight” or “emphasize” something.

::: greybox 
You’ll often see phrases like:
•	highlighting…
•	emphasizing…
•	reflecting…
•	underscoring…
•	contributing to…

## Excessive Use of Emojis
AI models sometimes add emojis to headings, lists, or responses to sound friendly.
This can make the writing feel unprofessional or too casual, especially in work-related documents.

::: greybox 
🚨 Underlying Motivation:
Why would a human fight you on this?

🧭 What You’re Actually Dealing With:
This is not a debate about rules.
:::

## Overuse of Em Dashes (—)
AI uses em dashes much more than most humans do.
It often puts them in places where a comma or parentheses would be clearer.
Overusing them makes the writing feel dramatic or overly polished in a forced way.
