Relying on the same user research method like only running 1-on-1 interviews leads to blind spots. Interviews are great for depth, but they don’t reveal group dynamics, cross-team dependencies, or patterns that emerge at scale.

To design experiences that scale, you need insights that are qualitative and quantitative, attitudinal and behavioural, and drawn from both individuals and teams.

## Why mix research methods?

As Christian Rohrer from Nielsen Norman Group explains, UX research spans multiple dimensions:

- **Attitudinal vs Behavioral** – what users *say* vs what they *do*
- **Qualitative vs Quantitative** – *why* something happens vs *how often* it happens
- **Context of Use** – natural use, scripted tasks, or abstracted activities

According to NN/g, no single method will uncover everything. Mixing methods leads to stronger insights and fewer blind spots.

### Mixing research methods helps you:

- Understand both individual workflows and systemic issues
- Avoid designing for edge cases or only the loudest voices
- Uncover hidden workarounds and friction between teams
- Generate more reliable, well-rounded insights

## What methods should I combine?

| Method                         | Use it to                                               |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-on-1 interviews             | Explore personal workflows and uncover pain points         |
| Group workshops / focus groups | Reveal shared behaviors and team-level challenges          |
| Observation / shadowing       | Catch things users don’t say (but still do)                |
| Surveys                       | Quantify trends or confirm emerging patterns across users  |

You don’t need to use every method on every project, but most projects benefit from using at least two.

## Practical example

::: greybox
A UX designer begins by interviewing three Admins to understand how they use the system. Based on those findings, she runs a 60-minute group workshop with Admins and Technicians to map shared issues and uncover workflow gaps between teams.

Only interviewing one user and assuming their experience applies to everyone. Skipping group validation and relying on stakeholder assumptions.

## Bonus tip: Mix user roles, not just methods

Group sessions are a great way to bring in users from different teams, departments, or levels of experience. Doing so can help you uncover:

- Gaps in communication
- Conflicting priorities
- “Unofficial” workarounds users rely on

These types of issues rarely come up in 1-on-1 interviews alone.
