You don’t want to build solutions from scratch, so take what business value you can from a CMS: don't reinvent the wheel.

> A CMS allows business users to build and manage websites without having to write any code.

## Headless CMS vs Traditional CMS

\
**Source**: <https://www.udig.com/digging-in/traditional-cms-vs-headless-cms/>

A Traditional CMS is a monolith, which means it has both a front-end and back-end. It uses server side technology like PHP (Wordpress,  Joomla, Magento) or ASP.Net (DNN, Umbraco, Sitefinity) and a single database. All pages are served by one or many backend servers.

A Headless CMS deals strictly with the content. Created content is accessed via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which gives you full flexibility on how you build the front-end for your website. 

For example, you can use a Headless CMS with a super fast Static Site Generator (SSG). See our rule on the [best static site tech](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/do-you-use-the-best-static-site-tech-stack).

**The bottom line:** if you value your content over the general look and feel of the content, then you should use a Headless CMS. A Headless CMS allows you to display your data as you like, without restrictively coupling the backend content and frontend UI.

### Pros of a Traditional CMS

* **Simple and fast** - for setup and maintenance 
* **No developers needed** - for larger websites or a complicated CMS (e.g. SiteCore), this may become necessary
* **Simple to control look and feel** - using available themes and templates
* **Large community support**
* **Out of the box integrations** - payments, social media, etc.

### Cons of a Traditional CMS

* **Performance is not amazing** - the frontend is coupled with the backend.
* **Does not scale very well** - all pages render server side, so you will need more servers if you have lots of traffic.
* **Locked-in** - content is only available on browsers and not on native mobile apps.
* **Limited flexibility** - you are limited to themes and templates, e.g. if you want to build a multi-step form.
* **You need developers with particular CMS skills** - If you have a big website or are using complicated CMS features, you will need CMS developers - e.g. for SiteCore or Sitefinity.
* **It is not an API first solution**

### Pros of a Headless CMS

* **Super fast** - fast initial load time when using Static Site Generator (SSG).
* **Scales very well** - when using Static Site Generator, and the frontend can be cached via CDN.
* **Ultimate flexibility with how to use content** - can use SPA, Static Site Generator or even native mobile apps. Not restricted by themes, templates or vendor, and you can have multiple frontends with 1 headless CMS backend.
* **Many options to build frontend** - NextJs, HUGO. Gatsby, React, Angular, etc. This makes it easier and cheaper to find developers.
* **Easy publishing** - The same content can be published to different platforms at the same time (website, web app, native mobile app).

### Cons of a Headless CMS

* **You need frontend developers** - the CMS only handles the backend content.
* **Greater overhead** - to maintain the code base, DevOps, etc.
* **Limited preview functionality** - Content creator can’t preview exact content (Netlify CMS helps).

<br>

**The bottom line:** we recommend Kontent as the Headless CMS of choice because it has better UI editing features, better [Content Modelling](https://docs.kontent.ai/tutorials/set-up-kontent/content-modeling/what-is-content-modeling) features, is more future-proofed with its Content Modelling, and has more scalable pricing.
