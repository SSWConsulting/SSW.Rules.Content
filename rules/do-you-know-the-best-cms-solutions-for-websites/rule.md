### Headless CMS vs traditional CMS

Traditional CMS is a monolith (has both backend and frontend) and uses server side technology like PHP (Wordpress,  Joomla, Magento) or ASP.Net (DNN, Umbraco, Sitefinity) and single database. All pages are served by one or many backend servers.

Headless CMS deals strictly with the content. Created contents are accessed via Application Programming Interface (API), you have full flexibility on how you build the front-end for your website.

### Pros of traditional CMS
- Simple to setup and maintain (you don’t need developer if you want to build a simple website)
- Simple to control look and feel of the website (using available themes and templates)
- Large communities support
- Out of the box integrations with other platforms (payments, social media, etc.)

### Cons of traditional CMS
- Performance is not great (frontend is coupled with backend)
- Does not scale very well (all pages render server side, you will need more servers if you have lots of traffic)
- Locked-in, content is only available on browsers (e.g. not on native mobile app), .
- Limited flexibility (limited to themes, templates, e.g if you want to build a multi steps form)
- You need developers with particular CMS skills (e.g. you need SiteCore or Sitefinity developers)
- Not an API first solution

### When should you choose traditional CMS
- You need to be up and running fast
- Happy with vendor lock-in and limitation
- Don’t want to deal with developers
- Your content is delivered via website only (no native mobile app)
- You after simple, single solution for your website

### Pros of headless CMS
- Super fast, fast initial load time (when using Static Site Generator (SSG))
- Scale very well (when using Static Site Generator), frontend can be cached via CDN
- Ultimate flexibility on how content is delivered (use SPA, Static Site Generator or even native mobile apps, not restricted by themes, templates or vendor), you can have multi frontend with 1 headless CMS backend
- Many options to build frontend (NextJs, HUGO. Gatsby, React, Angular, etc) make it easier (and potentially cheaper) to find developers 
- Same content can be published to different platforms at the same time (website, web app, native mobile app)

### Cons of headless CMS
- You need frontend developers 
- More overheads (maintain code base, DevOps, etc)
- Content creator can’t preview exact content (Netlify CMS helps)
