You don’t want to build solutions from scratch, so take what business value you can from a CMS: don't reinvent the wheel.

A CMS allows business users to build and manage websites without having to write any code.

## Headless CMS vs Traditional CMS

**Source**: [Traditional CMS vs Headless CMS](https://www.udig.com/digging-in/traditional-cms-vs-headless-cms)

A Traditional CMS is a monolith, which means it has both a front-end and back-end. It uses server side technology like PHP (Wordpress,  Joomla, Magento) or ASP.Net (DNN, Umbraco, Sitefinity) and a single database. All pages are served by one or many backend servers.

A Headless CMS deals strictly with the content. Created content is accessed via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which gives you full flexibility on how you build the front-end for your website. 

For example, you can use a Headless CMS with a super fast Static Site Generator (SSG): see the rule on the [best static site tech](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/do-you-use-the-best-static-site-tech-stack).

> Traditional CMSes like Sitecore and Kentico Xperience have their place, especially if you have no developers and you’re comfortable with serious vendor lock-in. Headless CMSes and static sites for the win.
> -Adam Cogan

Here is a breakdown of Traditional CMS architecture vs Headless CMS architecture:

![Figure: Traditional CMS Architecture](cms-architecture-traditional.jpg)

![Figure: Headless CMS Architecture](cms-architecture-headless.jpg)

### ✅ Traditional CMS - Pros

* **Simple and fast** - for setup and maintenance 
* **No developers needed for small-medium projects** - for larger websites or a complicated CMS (e.g. SiteCore), this may become necessary.
* **Simple to control look and feel** - using available themes and templates
* **Large community support**
* **Out of the box integrations** - payments, social media, etc.

### ❌ Traditional CMS - Cons

* **Performance is not amazing** - the frontend is coupled with the backend.
* **Does not scale very well** - all pages render server side, so you will need more servers if you have lots of traffic.
* **Locked-in** - content is only available on browsers and not on native mobile apps.
* **Limited flexibility** - you are limited to themes and templates, e.g. if you want to build a multi-step form.
* **You need developers with particular CMS skills** - If you have a big website or are using complicated CMS features, you will need CMS developers - e.g. for SiteCore or Sitefinity.
* **It is not an API first solution**

### ✅ Headless CMS - Pros

* **Super fast** - fast initial load time when using Static Site Generator (SSG).
* **Scales very well** - when using Static Site Generator, and the frontend can be cached via CDN.
* **Ultimate flexibility with how to use content** - can use a Single Page Application (SPA), Static Site Generator (SSG) or even native mobile apps. Not restricted by themes, templates or vendor, and you can have multiple frontends with 1 headless CMS backend.
* **Many options to build frontend** - NextJs, HUGO. Gatsby, React, Angular, etc. This makes it easier and cheaper to find developers.
* **Easy publishing** - The same content can be published to different platforms at the same time (website, web app, native mobile app).

### ❌ Headless CMS - Cons

* **You need frontend developers** - the CMS only handles the backend content.
* **Greater overhead** - to maintain the code base, DevOps, etc.
* **Limited preview functionality** - Content creator can’t preview exact content (Netlify CMS helps).

## Headless CMS Comparison: Kontent vs Contentful

Let's compare two popular CMSs.

Terms:

**Content Modelling** - the ability to model your website components, and see how they are used in your website.

**Collections** - allows you to manage content dependent on your business and geographical structure. This eliminates the use of silos, which make it more difficult to manage your data.

**Website optimisation** - See the Kontent's useful [docs](https://docs.kontent.ai/tutorials/develop-apps/optimize-your-app/seo-friendly-content) on this topic.
