 When you want to update the Rule Title, please DO NOT update them in the list directly.<br>
&#160;Click the URL near it, navigate to the Rule Summary page, and edit the Rule Summary Page Title, it will automatically update&#58;<br>
<ul>
    <li>&#160;Rule Summary Page Title </li>
    <li>Site Title </li>
    <li>Item Title in RuleCategoryLookupData List </li>
</ul>
