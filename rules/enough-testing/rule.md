We know that [complete testing is impossible](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/complete-testing-is-impossible), so we need ways to help us decide when to stop testing, i.e. when we've done "enough" testing.

Since complete testing is impossible, choosing the tests to perform is essentially a sampling problem. Adopting approaches such as [risk-based testing]**(need URL here)** are important in making good sampling decisions.



The focus should be on doing "good enough testing". You can say you’re done when you have a testing story adequately covering the risks agreed with your stakeholders and you can make the case that additional tests will probably not significantly change your story. Depending on the situation, this might require months of testing, sometimes only hours.
