Notion of “good enough”, again refer to futility of testing everything. Refer also to new risk-based testing rule
https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/complete-testing-is-impossible

We can’t do complete testing, so what can we do?
Since complete testing is impossible, choosing the tests to perform is essentially a sampling problem. Adopting approaches such as risk-based testing are important in making good sampling decisions.

The focus should be on doing "good enough testing". You can say you’re done when you have a testing story adequately covering the risks agreed with your stakeholders and you can make the case that additional tests will probably not significantly change your story. Depending on the situation, this might require months of testing, sometimes only hours.
