Your employees are your greatest asset, yet their valuable knowledge and insights often go unnoticed. Why not harness their creativity and problem-solving abilities by hosting a fun and collaborative brainstorming day? It's a simple but effective way to unlock innovative ideas, foster team bonding, and empower your workforce. 🧠💪

Employees on the front line often have valuable insights into opportunities for improvement, what is painful, increased efficiency, and even entirely new business ideas. Empowering these employees with an annual brainstorming day is a great way to transform their good ideas into valuable solutions, as well as giving them the opportunity to learn and grow from each other. Also, many employees enjoy the opportunity to flex their creative muscles in fun ways that their day-to-day jobs may not always afford them.

Different companies have different approaches to this. For example:

* **Atlassian** - give employees 1 day a year to work on a feature they want
* **Google** - employees are allowed to dedicate 20% of their time to 'pet projects' (subject to approval)
* **Microsoft** - Scott Guthrie takes senior leaders offsite for 1 week each year
* **SSW** - Adam Cogan conducts an annual brainstorming day in each state office

### How an annual brainstorming day works

At an annual brainstorming day, employees are invited to share their ideas, give feedback, and pick the best one to work on. The benefits of brainstorming are 
 [well understood](https://raybourn.com/the-5-benefits-of-brainstorming/), but in order to focus the productivity on something useful, it is important to have a system for suggesting, voting, and working on ideas.

Everyone at the company is encouraged to suggest ideas prior.

The process is broken down into 2 key stages: preparation and participation.

### Preparation

**1. Email Attendees**

Start by sending out an email to staff, inviting them to send through their suggestions in advance. E.g.:

### Email Template

::: email-template
|          |     |
| -------- | --- |
| To:      | SSWAll |
| Subject: | Prepare for our Brainstorming day | 
::: email-content

### Hi All,

I’m really excited about our brainstorming day! I hope you’re all thinking about what you would like to work on.

To prepare for our Brainstorming day, send Adam and Matt W. something that you would like work on as a group.
E.g. Our awesome SophieBot project came out of the Melbourne Brainstorming Session last year.   

Tip: A Done Video can help explain and sell your idea to other attendees ⭐

**2. GitHub Discussions - Curate the ideas**

On the brainstorming day, it can be intimidating for some people to be the first person to get up and share their idea with the group. GitHub Discussions provides an awesome way to let employees discuss the ideas and iterate upon them without feeling intimidated. GitHub Discussions also provide a good platform to illustrate to attendees what ideas can look like.

Here's how to set up the GitHub Discussions

1. First, look at ideas that have come through via email, and also any ideas from past brainstorming sessions
2. If necessary, call the person who came up with the idea and ask for further explanation or for them to record a Done Video to sell their idea.
3. Create GitHub Discussions for any noteworthy ideas, these discussions will serve as talking points for your company to iterate upon the idea.  

**3. Microsoft Forms - Gather, iterate and gauge interest in ideas** 

Now that you have some initially curated ideas use Microsoft forms to gather, iterate and gauge interest in ideas. Here's what to do:

1. Create a Microsoft Form and populate the intro with a short explanation of the day, some previous success stories, and the list of GitHub Discussions
2. Add the following questions to the form
- Retro - What is working well at {{ COMPANY NAME }}?
- Retro - What are 1 (or more) things that you would improve at {{ COMPANY NAME }}?
- Any brainstorming ideas for tomorrow?
3. 1 week before the brainstorming session send out the form to the company.
4. 1 day before the brainstorming review the results of the form, curate the ideas, and create GitHub Discussions for any new and awesome ideas.
5. Using the nicely curated ideas, create a 2nd Microsoft Form with the following questions:
- Ideas - Rank the importance of fixing these items
 
  👨 = friendly for non-devs
8. Send that form out to all employees to gauge interest and importance in the ideas.


### Participation - Break into Teams

On the day, follow the agenda set out in your attendee email:

* Have the 2nd Microsoft Form showing on a projector.
* 8 am: Welcome everyone and thank those that submitted ideas.
* Call out who the scribe is. (They will update the GitHub Discussions in the background).
* Split into teams: work through the list of ideas in the Microsoft Form starting with the most popular one. Ask the attendees to gather in a group if they want to join that team.
* Create Microsoft Team: Now that you have the groups, create a Microsoft Team and a channel for each group. Then attendees can store documents (e.g. their presentation) in that team and set to work building a prototype or proof of concept.  
* 1 pm: Give the attendees a break for lunch.
* 3 pm: Attendees come back in, and each group takes turns presenting their work to the rest of the attendees.

**Note**: The top-voted suggestion may not be technical, and the prototype or proof of concept doesn't have to be a technical solution. It could very well be a prototype application or website, but equally could be a new business process or a video.
