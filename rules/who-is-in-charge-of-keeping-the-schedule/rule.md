It is really important that your speakers feel empowered, so make sure you give them the tools they need to run their event well.

<!--endintro-->

On the day of your event, chat to the speaker and give them the Speaker Checklist so they know how the day will run:

### 1. Agenda


* Tell the audience the agenda, so they know the break times.
* We recommend the following breaks:

### 2. Breaks


Attendees will often ask you what time the break will start or finish, so if you write it down they can refer it instead of asking you!

Tip: You can print out [this PDF "Break-Ends-Sheet,"](/Documents/break-ends-sheet.pdf) to keep them informed, without answering the same question many times!

TIP: We also have a handy rule on this: https://rules.ssw.com.au/do-you-set-a-clear-end-time-for-breaks

### 3. Names


Draw yourself a rough diagram of the room, start with intros an then go around the room and write people's names down for future reference. It will make speaking to them later a lot more personal if you can learn their name.

Tip: Draw the table layout before people arrive - it's faster. It's also easy if you draw the view you see looking at the audience.

### 4. (Optional) Coffee Orders:

* Ask attendees what coffee they would like, or ask them to fill out an electronic form and give this to your admin staff


### 5. Evaluations:


* Please give your evaluation forms out around 4pm to give people time to complete them.
