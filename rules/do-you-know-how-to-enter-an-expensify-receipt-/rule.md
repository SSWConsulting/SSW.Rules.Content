<span class='intro'> Expensify is great for tracking receipts, but if you don't use it in&#160;the right way the reports can be hard to reconcile.<br><div><br></div><div>To avoid confusion, add as much detail as possible about the purchase and who authorised it. To make this easier, your company can set required entry&#160;fields to ensure that you have all of the relevant data for each claim.<br></div> </span>

A&#160;Date,&quot;&#160;&quot;Name of Merchant,&quot; and what the expense was for is clearly identified and you can also see each has an&#160;attached&#160;receipt. You can also see in one example that&#160;an additional&#160;&quot;Comment&quot;&#160;has been added to a more complicated expense to reflect the approval for that purhase.<br></dd></dl>
