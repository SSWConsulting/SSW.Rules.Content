<span class='intro'> ​​Expensify is great for tracking receipts, but if you don't use it in&#160;the right way the reports can be hard to reconcile.<br><div><br></div><div>To avoid confusion, add as much detail as possible about the purchase and who authorised it. To make this easier, your company can set some&#160;required fields to ensure that you have all of the relevant data entered for each claim. This&#160;will make your claims a lot more unified and easier to process.&#160;<br></div> </span>
