<span class='intro'>  Expensify is great for tracking receipts, but if you don't use it in&#160;the right way the reports can be hard to reconcile.<br><div><br></div><div>To avoid confusion, add as much detail as possible about the purchase and who authorized it. To make this easier, your company can set some&#160;required fields to ensure that you have all of the relevant data entered for each claim. This&#160;will make your claims a lot more unified and easier to process.&#160;<br></div> </span>

<p>For example, on the free version of Expensify, you can make the &quot;Category&quot; field&#160;a required field&#160;by switching the option to enabled.&#160;</p><p>More features are available if you purchase the full version, and&#160;you can see these options on their <a href="https&#58;//www.expensify.com/pricing#features">pricing features page.</a> </p><dl class="image"><dt> <img src="./Expensify%20options.png" alt="Expensify options.png" style="width&#58;700px;height&#58;524px;" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Selecting &quot;Enabled&quot; ensures that people using your policy have to enter that field before claiming&#160;</dd></dl><p>Required fields are then&#160;identified&#160;by an asterisk when you are uploading an expense. Conveniently, most of this information is completed for you by the Smart Scan function.&#160; On the free version,&#160;there is still room to add a manual&#160;&quot;Comment&quot;&#160;for more complicated claims if required.</p><dl class="badImage"><dt> <img src="/SiteAssets/how-to-enter-an-expensify-receipt/Expensify_nocompulsary.png" alt="Expensify_nocompulsary.png" style="width&#58;700px;height&#58;436px;" /> </dt><dd> Figure&#58; Bad Example - here there are only 3 required fields shown&#160;for this claim, the&#160;Name of Merchant, the&#160;Date, and the&#160;Total.&#160; Without adding an additional Category, or Comment, it will be more difficult&#160;for the accounts staff to process this claim<br></dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt> <img src="/SiteAssets/how-to-enter-an-expensify-receipt/Expensify1.png" alt="Expensify1.png" style="width&#58;700px;height&#58;433px;" /> </dt><dd> Figure&#58; Good Example -&#160;You can see the fields marked with an asterisk&#160;that they are&#160;required fields.&#160;To claim an&#160;expense from&#160;SSW, you need to give the &quot;Name of Merchant&quot;, the &quot;Date&quot; of purchase, &quot;Total&quot;, and a &quot;Category&quot;. Most of this information is completed for you by the smart scan and there is still room to add a manual&#160;&quot;Comment&quot; for more complicated claims if requiredâ€‹<br></dd></dl><p>If you complete these fields, it will make your reports much nicer to read and easier to claim.<br></p><dl class="goodImage"><dt> <img src="/SiteAssets/how-to-enter-an-expensify-receipt/Expensify%20example%20categories.png" alt="Expensify example categories.png" style="width&#58;700px;height&#58;612px;" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good example - You can see highlighted here that the expenses have been sorted by &quot;Category&quot; and that they have all of the relevant information to claim. A&#160;Date,&quot;&#160;&quot;Name of Merchant,&quot; and what the expense was for is clearly identified and you can also see each has an&#160;attached&#160;receipt. You can also see in one example that&#160;an additional&#160;&quot;Comment&quot;&#160;has been added to a more complicated expense to reflect the approval for that purchase <br></dd></dl>
