Dispel myth of complete/exhaustive testing, introduce idea that testing is essentially a sampling problem
Bach: Perfect testing is potentially an infinite process. If complete testing means you have to run all possible tests, you will never finish. But you can say you’re done when you have a testing story with all the major plot points, and you can make the case that additional tests will probably not significantly change your story. Here’s the thing: Although you never know for sure if you have reached that point of diminishing returns, you don’t need to know for sure! All that’s required, all that anyone can expect of you, is that you have a compelling story for why a thoughtful and responsible tester like you might come to the judgment that you know enough about the product under test. In some situations, that will be months of testing; in other situations, only hours.

Kaner: Complete coverage is 100% coverage of all of the possible tests. The program is completely tested if there cannot be any undiscovered bugs (because you’ve run all the possible tests). For nontrivial programs, complete testing is impossible because the population of possible tests is infinite. So you can’t have complete coverage. You can only have partial coverage.
