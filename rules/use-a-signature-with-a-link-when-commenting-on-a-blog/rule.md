Backlinks are a big part of Google's ranking algorithm, and one way to take advantage of that is to make sure that you always comment on people's blogs... this could be to ask a question, or just to say thanks, but make sure you add a link back to your company website after your name.

On the management side, you can see if your employees are doing this by googling (in this case) "Ulysses Maclaren www.ssw.com.au" during annual reviews to see how much google juice they are adding to your website.
