<ul><li>They do not know how long the process will last (adds uncertainty to the user experience)</li>
<li>They cannot stop the process (creates lack of control in the user experience)</li></ul> </span>

â€‹<div>Instead, keep users happy with your application by&#58;</div>
<ul><li>Showing status description information above the progress bar</li>
<li>Allowing the user to stop the process at any time by clicking &quot;Cancel&quot; (or as a minimum, prompt for confirmation before the long running process starts)</li></ul>
