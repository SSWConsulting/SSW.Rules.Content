TagWith adds comments to the generated SQL. This makes it easier to identify queries when they run on the database.

<!--endintro-->

This is very useful when debugging issues as there are often multiple pieces of code that generate similar statements and as such it's hard to identify what is executing particular queries.

```cs
var list = await context
    .Sales
    .TagWith("Get All Sales")
    .ToListAsync(ct);
```

Figure: Code to add tagging

```sql
-- Get All Sales

select * from sales
```

Figure: SQL generated by the above code
