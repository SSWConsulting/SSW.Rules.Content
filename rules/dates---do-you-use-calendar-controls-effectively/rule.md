                    In Outlook, the Calendar control has a number of important features&#58;</p><ul><li>Saturday and Sunday are displayed at the <em>end</em>.</li><li>Days that have data associated with them are <strong>bold</strong></li><li>The current day is highlighted with a box</li></ul>

                    Users are familiar with the Outlook calendar control. When the calendar control 
                    is used it should incorporate all of these features of the Outlook calendar 
                    control.</p><dl class="badImage"><dt>
