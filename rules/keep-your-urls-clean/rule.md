Step 1 - Remember to remove the https from your URLs in your presentations. It keeps the pages cleaner and more readable.

:::


::: good  
![Figure: Good Example – These links are clean](ppt-urls-good.png)  
:::

Step 2 - Even when you’re sending emails, or pinging someone in Teams, your URLs should be as clean as possible. This ensures that they are easy to read, and it is more aesthetically pleasing.

URLs have become increasingly cluttered with the introduction of tracking information. 

For example, companies use CampaignIDs on their website to track customer activities and information, but when you’re sharing the URLs, it is better to make them clean and readable. So, delete everything after the question mark (including the CampaignID suffix).
