Shelveset’s are useful for keeping your code on the server when you are not ready to check in. They are even created to allow Gated Check-in to work. But where do they go?<div>Well, if you don’t delete your Shelves once you are done with them they hang around forever…</div>

<p>Use the Shelveset Sidekick in <a href="http&#58;//www.attrice.info/cm/tfs/index.htm">Team Foundation Sidekicks </a>at the end of every month to make sure you have not forgotten anything.</p>
