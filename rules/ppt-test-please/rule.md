Image is everything. Improve the way you market, educate and promote yourself with striking presentations. Your content might be great - but if it is displayed poorly - it will be overshadowed by its flaws. Use a designer to make your presentation stand out.  

<!--endintro-->

1. Do the best job you can on your presentation
2. Get a senior developer to go through it
3. ⭐️ Then give to a designer for better look and feel
4. Show it to an audience to get feedback

\[TODO: Hashem - Add a before and after image \]
**Figure: Before and after... Designers can make anything look good**
