<span class='intro'> ​Often clients will see a multi-page T&amp;C document with a box at the end that says sign here, and they will think that is the only important page and so sign it and send it back. However this can be a problem when you've got to provide evidence as to the content of the whole document they signed. To fix this issue, you can get them to re-send you through the entire document, but sometimes you don’t want to rock the boat. Here is another solution&#58; </span>

<ol><li>Print out the section of the contract/T&amp;C's the client sent </li><li>Print off the balance of the pages from the relevant document (e.g. from the website) - of course it has to be the same document the client sent you a part of</li><li>Scan the documents together as one document</li><li>Email that entire document to the client</li></ol><p class="greyBox"> 
   ​Dear Client. <br>Because you only sent me the last page I printed the other pages and scanned all the pages as one document for convenience. If there any problems, please let me know​</p><div><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">​Figure -&#160;Good example&#58; An elegant and helpful&#160;solution​<br></dd></div>
