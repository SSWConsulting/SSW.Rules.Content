Often clients will see a multi-page T&C document with a box at the end that says sign here, and they will think that is the only important page and so sign it and send it back. However this can be a problem when you've got to provide evidence as to the content of the whole document they signed. To fix this issue, you can get them to re-send you through the entire document, but sometimes you don’t want to rock the boat. Here is another solution: 
<!--endintro-->

1. Print out the section of the contract/T&C's the client sent
2. Print off the balance of the pages from the relevant document (e.g. from the website) - of course it has to be the same document the client sent you a part of
3. Scan the documents together as one document
4. Email that entire document to the client

Dear Client. 
Because you only sent me the last page I printed the other pages and scanned all the pages as one document for convenience. If there any problems, please let me know
