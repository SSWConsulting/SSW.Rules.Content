Installing MS Lync client on Andriod devices. Employees should be contactable no matter if they are in the office or not  (at a client). By installing the Lync client, everyone knows where they are and if they are available to take calls or answer questions that may arise.

1. Search for “Lync” in the [Play store](https://play.google.com/store)<dl class="image">&lt;dt&gt;<img alt="android_playstore.png" src="241b2b_android_playstore.png" style="margin:5px;width:421px;">&lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: Search for Lync in Playstore</dd></dl>
