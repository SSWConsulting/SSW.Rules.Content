For a great 'Done Video' here are the key things to remember:

<!--endintro-->

1. Generic - Keep your video appealing and easy to understand for a global audience.
2. Prepare - Plan what you're going to say and open the browser tabs you'll show beforehand. This means you should practice what you're going to say, especially your ending!
3. Framing - Have your webcam height at eye level and get your whole head in the shot.
4. Lighting - Ensure optimal room lighting and facial brightness. Consider a ceiling-pointing lamp for additional light. Avoid intense backlights to prevent silhouetting.
5. Introduction - Start by introducing yourself and what you will be talking about. E.g. "Hi everyone, today I would like to show you...".
6. Ending - Finish with a strong closing that summarizes what you talked about.
7. Show the pain - Demonstrate the problem that your new feature will fix, then demonstrate your feature.
8. One-Take - Record it in one take, but start again if it's super bad.
9. Quick - Keep it short, concise, and don't repeat yourself!
10. Directing Attention - Give people an idea of where to look.
11. Clean UI - Use a clean browser and IDE, and zoom in to 125% in your browser. Note: You can easily get a clean browser by using a guest profile.
12. Resolution - Set your screen to 1080p (1920x1080).
13. Recording - Record both your screen and webcam.
14. Audio - Check your audio devices for the best quality and make sure your audio is clear and not distracting.
15. Be friendly - Interact with your webcam like it's a person, and smile at the start and end.
16. No Edits - Don't edit the video; use a picture-in-picture format and hotkeys to switch visuals. 

Remember to watch some "Done" videos to get an idea of what a good "Done Video" looks like!
