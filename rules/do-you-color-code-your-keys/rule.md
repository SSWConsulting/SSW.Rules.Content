<span class='intro'> <p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​​​Keys, we all have them. A key for the front door, a key for the garage, a key to the letterbox, and keys to your office… the list is often endless! How much time do you waste finding the correct key?​<br></p> </span>

<p>If you allocate each individual lock a color and then tag or colour your keys to match, you can save a lot of time and effort identifying the correct key.<br></p>

Using nail polish&#160;to mark your keys,&#160;or using&#160;a key ​cover is a better way to go!&#160;<br></p>
