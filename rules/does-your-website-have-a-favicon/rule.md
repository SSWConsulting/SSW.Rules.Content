Don't forget to add a favicon to the address bar of your website! That extra bit of polish gives your site credibility.

<!--endintro-->

Simply add the following within the head tags on your document:




```
<head>

      <LINK REL="SHORTCUT ICON" HREF="/ssw/Images/icossw_v2.ico">

      </head>
```
