Don't forget to add a favicon to the address bar of your website! That extra bit of polish gives your site credibility.

<!--endintro-->

Simply add the following within the `<head>` tag on your document:

``` html
<head>
      <link rel="shortcut icon" href="/ssw/images/icossw_v2.ico">
</head>
```
