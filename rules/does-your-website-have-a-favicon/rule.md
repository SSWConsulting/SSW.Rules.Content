<p>
      Don't forget to add a favicon to the address bar of your website! That extra bit of polish gives your site credibility.
     </p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>
      Simply add the following within the head tags on your document&#58;
     </p><div class="code"><p class="ssw15-rteElement-CodeArea">
      &lt;head&gt;<br>
      &lt;LINK REL=&quot;SHORTCUT ICON&quot; HREF=&quot;/ssw/Images/icossw_v2.ico&quot;&gt;<br>
      &lt;/head&gt;</p>
                    </div>
