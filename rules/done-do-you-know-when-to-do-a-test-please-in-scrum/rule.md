Something you must do is to conduct an internal ”Test Please” prior to releasing anything to a client. This should be done by someone outside the Scrum Team and as it is a blocking process must be started within an hour and take no longer than 3 hours to complete.

<!--endintro-->

In Scrum, you should conduct a separate “Test Please” for each of the stories. You might be using the same package, but all the bugs and issues found must be rolled up to the [Story Owner](/tasks-do-you-know-that-every-user-story-should-have-an-owner) as they will need to decide on what needs to be done to deliver their User Story.
