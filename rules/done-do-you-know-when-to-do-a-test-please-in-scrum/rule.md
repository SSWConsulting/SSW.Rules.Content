Something you must do it to conduct an internal ”[Test Please](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=d66a9404-2ca9-4d19-ad6c-df1618b4fc28)” prior to releasing anything to a client. This should be conducted by someone outside the Scrum Team and as it is a blocking process must be started within an hour and take no longer than 3 hours to complete.

**Rules to Successful Projects**

1. [Do you conduct an internal "test please" prior to releasing a version to a client?](/conduct-a-test-please-internally-and-then-with-the-client)
2. [Do you know the 4 steps to do a "Test Please"?](/do-you-know-the-tools-you-need-before-a-test-please)


In Scrum, you should conduct a separate “[Test Please”](/conduct-a-test-please-internally-and-then-with-the-client) for each of the stories. You might be using the same package, but all the bugs and issues found must be rolled up to the [Story Owner](/tasks-do-you-know-that-every-user-story-should-have-an-owner) as they will need to decide on what needs to be done to deliver their Story.
