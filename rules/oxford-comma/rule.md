The "Oxford comma" has the distinction of being one of the most hotly debated elements of the English language.

The Oxford comma, also referred to as the series comma or serial comma, is placed in a series of three or more items before the coordinating conjunction. It can be used in both "and" and "or" lists as the last comma separating a series of items. It works to help order these items and provide a distinction between the items on the list, particularly the last two items.

K﻿nowing when to use the Oxford comma helps to create more consistent and easier to read documentation.
