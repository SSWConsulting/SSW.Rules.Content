Creating a Production Build of a React project is complicated, you need great tools.

<!--endintro-->

### Webpack


**Webpack**  is a module bundler. It packs CommonJs/AMD modules. See:

* [https://webpack.js.org/concepts](https&#58;//webpack.js.org/concepts)
* [https://rules.ssw.com.au/the-best-build-tool](/the-best-build-tool)


### Create React App




```
npm run build
```



**Create React App ** uses Webpack under the hood.npm run build creates a build directory with a production build of your app. See:

* [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/production-build](https&#58;//facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/production-build)
