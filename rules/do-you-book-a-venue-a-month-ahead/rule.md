At least a month before a user group talk the room for the presentation should be booked.

1. Book the room at the venue via a phone call
2. Send a meeting request "as per our conversation" to reserve the room to the admin staff at the venue, cc the presenter and the user group organizer
3. If a speaker has not yet been appointed for the month, add them to the appointment when they are booked in
