When you're working, you will encounter issues that block you from progressing, force you to do a lot of research or otherwise spend time building towards being able to complete your work. In these moments, the question arises, "When should I ask for help?"

Before asking for help, make sure you've done your due-diligence and exhausted your normal avenues for unblocking yourself. Here are some examples for developers:

- Try Googling it
- Check Stack Overflow
- Read the documentation e.g. [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/)
- Explore the code e.g.
- look at if any other pages do similar things
- put breakpoints and check the values to see if you can figure out little bits
- Systematically check things, check a tiny part, confirm your understanding, then move to the next part
- Try to resolve it yourself a few times (at least 30 mins)



As everyone's struggles are different and everyone's way of handling pressure is different, it's hard to provide a useful metric for precisely when to ask for help. However, here's a general rule to follow:

1. Find the smallest 'significant' amount of work that your project can allocate. In Scrum, this would be the smallest effort value (Extra-Small if using shirt sizes)
2. If you spend that amount of time trying to work out the problem, you **should** ask for help

Once you've determined that you need help it is vital to [draft up context about what you have done](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/do-you-add-context-reasoning-to-your-emails) and [provide options so they have some starting point](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/do-you-manage-up).
