When you're working, you will encounter issues that block you from progressing, force you to do a lot of research, or otherwise spend time building towards completing your work. In these moments, the question arises, "When should I ask for help?"

Before asking for help, ensure you've done your due diligence and exhausted your usual avenues for unblocking yourself. This concept is critical when trying to talk with Senior developers because their time is much more valuable. If you [call them without having done any research, it will waste a lot of their time and yours](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/investigate-your-question-for-two-minutes-before-asking-someone-on-im) and won't be a good [ROI](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/return-on-investment). 

Here are some things developers should try before asking for help:



- Try Googling it
- Check [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- Read the documentation e.g. [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/)
- Explore the code e.g.
  - Look at if any other pages do similar things
  - Put breakpoints and check the values to see if you can figure out little bits
  - Systematically check things, check a tiny part, confirm your understanding, then move to the next part
- Try to resolve it yourself a few times (at least 30 mins)





As everyone's struggles are different and everyone's way of handling pressure differs, it's hard to provide a useful metric for when to ask for help. However, here's a general rule to follow:

1. Set aside 1 hour for a small bit of work.

Alternatively, if you're a developer in a Scrum team, then pick out a small task from your current PBI and estimate it.

2. If you exceed the hour or estimate without making progress, you **should** call for help. 




Once you've determined that you need help, it is vital to [draft up context about what you have done](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/do-you-add-context-reasoning-to-your-emails) and [provide options, so they have some starting point](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/do-you-manage-up).
