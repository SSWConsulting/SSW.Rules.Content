When you're working, you will encounter issues that block you from progressing, force you to do a lot of research, or otherwise spend time building towards being able to complete your work. In these moments, the question arises, "When should I ask for help?"



Before asking for help, make sure you've done your due-diligence and exhausted your normal avenues for unblocking yourself. This concept is critical when trying to talk with Senior developers because their time is much more valuable. If you [call them without having done any research, it will waste a lot of their time and yours](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/investigate-your-question-for-two-minutes-before-asking-someone-on-im) and won't be a good [ROI](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/return-on-investment). 

Here are some things developers should try before asking for help:



- Try Googling it
- Check [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- Read the documentation e.g. [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/)
- Explore the code e.g.
  - Look at if any other pages do similar things
  - Put breakpoints and check the values to see if you can figure out little bits
  - Systematically check things, check a tiny part, confirm your understanding, then move to the next part
- Try to resolve it yourself a few times (at least 30 mins)





As everyone's struggles are different and everyone's way of handling pressure is different, it's hard to provide a useful metric for precisely when to ask for help. However, here's a general rule to follow:



1. Work out how long a 'small' piece of work for your project might be. In Scrum, this would be the smallest effort value (Extra-Small if using shirt sizes). A more general rule is 1 hour.
2. If you spend that amount of time trying to work out the problem with no progress, you **should** ask for help



Once you've determined that you need help, it is vital to [draft up context about what you have done](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/do-you-add-context-reasoning-to-your-emails) and [provide options so they have some starting point](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/do-you-manage-up).
