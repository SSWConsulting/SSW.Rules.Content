When you're working, you will encounter issues that block you from progressing, force you to do a lot of research or otherwise spend time building towards being able to complete your work. In these moments, the question arises, "When should I ask for help?"

Before asking for help, make sure you've done your due-diligence and exhausted your normal avenues for unblocking yourself. Here are some examples for developers:

- Try Googling it
- Check Stack Overflow
- Read the documentation e.g. [Microsoft Docs](https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.microsoft.com%2Fen-au%2F&data=05%7C01%7CSamWagner%40ssw.com.au%7C2b80dfbf1b4c4397f32808da8aecff12%7Cac2f7c34b93548e9abdc11e5d4fcb2b0%7C0%7C0%7C637975047735355922%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=EMhkvkYBn%2BCbTaN7jP%2F9kem9MM%2FkaOPSKLHe3Gej6AM%3D&reserved=0)
- Explore the code e.g.
- look at if any other pages do similar things
- put breakpoints and check the values to see if you can figure out little bits
- Systematically check things, check a tiny part, confirm your understanding, then move to the next part
- Try to resolve it yourself a few times (at least 30 mins)



As everyone's struggles are different and everyone's way of handling pressure is different, it's hard to provide a useful metric for precisely when to ask for help. However, here's a general rule to follow:

1. Find the smallest 'significant' amount of work that your project can allocate. In Scrum, this would be the smallest effort value (Extra-Small if using shirt sizes)
2. If you spend that amount of time trying to work out the problem, you **should** ask for help

Once you've determined that you need help it is vital to [draft up context about what you have done](https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ssw.com.au%2Frules%2Fdo-you-add-context-reasoning-to-your-emails&data=05%7C01%7CSamWagner%40ssw.com.au%7C2b80dfbf1b4c4397f32808da8aecff12%7Cac2f7c34b93548e9abdc11e5d4fcb2b0%7C0%7C0%7C637975047735355922%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=rNlv9Yw%2B3JuEQLF%2BMmRgdOALxNoWw8%2FQv4n0hU5Ry2U%3D&reserved=0) and [provide options so they have some starting point](https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ssw.com.au%2Frules%2Fdo-you-manage-up&data=05%7C01%7CSamWagner%40ssw.com.au%7C2b80dfbf1b4c4397f32808da8aecff12%7Cac2f7c34b93548e9abdc11e5d4fcb2b0%7C0%7C0%7C637975047735355922%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=coB2z2m0aKvqUK7GmYXVjh28aFAoHgksg82QrpUHJB4%3D&reserved=0).
