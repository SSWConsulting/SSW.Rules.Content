<span class='intro'> <p>This is an advanced topic. The pre-requisites are that you already have Clustered nodes setup, and then your SAN.</p>
<p>Then you enable your Hyper-V role on your cluster.</p>
 </span>

<p>First refer to all rules listed in &quot;<a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=0ab13b4a-0d1e-4371-a527-cf4a611c67df" target="_blank">Rules to Better Hyper-V</a>&quot; as these are the basics for Hyper-V. </p>

<dd class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; The following rules are referring to the 2nd column on <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/HyperV.aspx" target="_blank">Hyper-V</a> (this also tells you why choose Hyper-V Live Migration over VMWare VMotion)</dd>
<p>Let's continue with the rules specially for clustering...</p>
