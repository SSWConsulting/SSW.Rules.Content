<p>This is an advanced topic. The pre-requisites are that you already have Clustered nodes setup, and then your SAN.</p>
<p>Then you enable your Hyper-V role on your cluster.</p>

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>First refer to all rules listed in "<a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=0ab13b4a-0d1e-4371-a527-cf4a611c67df" target="_blank">Rules to Better Hyper-V</a>" as these are the basics for Hyper-V. </p>

<p>Let's continue with the rules specially for clustering...</p>
