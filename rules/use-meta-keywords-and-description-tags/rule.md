One of the easiest ways to get the ball rolling with your web pages and being noticed by search engines is to use &lt;meta&gt; tags. Search engines use &lt;meta&gt; tags to categorize your website's content. Many webmasters took this as an opportunity to abuse the &lt;meta&gt; tags and the earlier less sophisticated search engines found that the quality of search results was suffering. Luckily today's search engines like Google don't give the &lt;meta&gt; tags so much weight when determining search engine results pages. In any case, we know that search engines do consider them so we think it would be silly to overlook such a quick and easy task to complete.

 There are many kinds of META tags you should use, these are the most common:

* META DESCRIPTION: Search engines will often use the information in the META DESCRIPTION tag as well as the TITLE to describe your site in the short description that goes along with the link in your search engine rankings. SEO experts recommends it to have under 300 characters.
* META KEYWORDS: This holds words that you can use to help search engines classify your content. The keywords you use must be relevant and must appear in the body text as well.
* META ROBOTS: is a tag that tells search engines what to follow and what not to follow. It is a simple piece of code in the &lt;head&gt; section of your webpage that gives you the power to decide about what pages you want to hide from search engine crawlers and what pages you want them to index and look at.
