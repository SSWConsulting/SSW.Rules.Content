Sometimes when editing a video, the editor wants to indicate good and bad examples to the audience. In that case, the editor needs some way to communicate that to the audience.

Ticks and crosses are a great way to emphasize an example in the content.

❌ Using ticks and crosses in the **wrong way may lead to a bad experience for your audience**

✅ Using ticks and crosses in the **right way will help provide clarity to your audience**

<!--endintro-->

A good tick and cross example will have:

* A graphic - with a well composed size and location
* A subtle sound

**NOTE:** Using a blend of tick and cross visuals with sound cues will reinforce for your audience which example is the good and which is the bad. 

## ❌ Bad Example #1

**Video: [SSW TV - Do you have a product roadmap? | 0:38 - 0:48](https://youtu.be/FXMMZvE1lig?t=38)**

In this video, the speaker introduces good and bad examples for the audience. No other visual elements are used in the video, and the downside of this is that when your listener's mind wades, he won't be able to follow you because there are no other elements or sound effects in the video to tell him what part to go on to.

## ❌ Bad Example #2

Video: [SSW TV - Do you check before installing 3rd party libraries? | 0:59 - 1:02](https://youtu.be/1LPK3jgga_c?t=59)

In this video, the editors add tick and sound effect to highlight good and bad examples to the audience. But on the one hand, this tick is in the middle of the footage, the audience's attention may be diverted from the content to this tick; On the other hand, the sound is louder than the speaker, which makes the audience feel dissonant. So distracting hooks and loud sounds are not appropriate.

## SSW TV Research: feedback on videos using ticks and crosses

In a weekly internal form known as "'Chewing the Fat', the SSW TV Team set three questions for SSW employees to answer: 

* Question #1 - With sound or without sound: Video Ticks and Crosses - Did you like them?
* Question #2 - Subtle sound or loud sound: Video Ticks and Crosses - Did you like them?
* Question #3 - Comparison: Video Ticks and Crosses V3 - What are your thoughts on the sound?

The data is divisive. For the sound on the ticks and crosses, half of the answers prefer subtle sounds and the other half prefer without sound.

### Results - Question #1 - With sound or without sound: Video Ticks and Crosses - Did you like them?

![Figure: Question #1 feedback - Option Others](ctf-1-options.png)

After watching video #1, people preferred having a sound rather than having no sound. Of the 9 other responses, 6 preferred with sound but they all thought the sound lasted too long, 2 of them prefer without sound, and the other 1 didn't comment on the sound.

The final results (including other) were:

* 55% prefer to have sound
* 31% prefer to have no sound
* 14% prefer no ticks and crosses at all
