While flexible work hours are awesome, and it’s fun to set your own schedule, most roles where you are working with a client require you to have set hours. Chopping and changing when you are available looks unprofessional, so you need to have a known routine.

Set your hours and stick to them. It’s ok to start at 7 am and finish at 4 pm, that’s fine as long as everyone knows those are you set hours. Keep a routine, it will help you stay focused and others to know when you're around.

Separate your work and home time - this is super important to help you structure your day and stay motivated.

Lock your computer when the working day ends, as you would normally do in the office.
