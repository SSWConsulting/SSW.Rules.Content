It's important that all of your SharePoint Sites are as consistent as possible.\
\
This helps the user to navigate a new page easily.  They need to know exactly where to look.

Following some simple rules makes this really easy.  

1. Always put any navigation in the same place

2. Use the same icons for the same types of things, so that a link to "Home" looks the same on each page. Or a user knows when they click on a link with a Word icon, a Microsoft Word document is going to open.
