It's important that all of your SharePoint Sites are as consistent as possible.\
\
This helps the user to navigate a new page easily.  They need to know exactly where to look.

<!--endintro-->

Following some simple rules makes this really easy.  

1. Always put any navigation in the same place
2. Use the same icons for the same types of things, so that a link to "Home" looks the same on each page. Or a user knows when they click on a link with a Word icon, a Microsoft Word document is going to open.
