It's important for all your SharePoint Sites to be as consistent as possible. This helps users' navigation through new pages as they know exactly where to look.

Following some simple rules makes this really easy.  

1. Put your preferred navigation in the same place (usually on the left-hand side)
2. Use the same icons for the same types of items, so that a link to "Home" looks the same on each page. Or a user knows when they click on a link with a Word icon, a Microsoft Word document is going to open.
