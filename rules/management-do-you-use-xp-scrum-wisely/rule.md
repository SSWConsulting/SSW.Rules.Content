Scrum is a big concept which we try to use here. I don't adhere to every idea, but there are some very practical rules I follow which improves the way we develop on large projects:  

<!--endintro-->

![Figure: You need to check up on your developers every 2 weeks. Then you'll never be fooled!](ab9491_Anthrax.gif)

1. **Sprint Contracts/Releases** - Never set a deadline more than 3 weeks from the previous deadline. Deliverables become a lot easier to manage and meet when they're small. Read more about [Sprint Contracts](/do-you-create-a-sprint-forecast-aka-the-functionality-that-will-be-developed-during-the-sprint)

2. **Unit Tests** - Write tests before you write code. Unit Tests become a way of life and although they're expensive at the beginning, they pay off during the course of the project. To find out more about Unit Tests see [Rules To Better Unit Tests](/rules-to-better-unit-tests) and for unit tests in the GUI of SSW Code Auditor please go to [Rules to Better Code](/rules-to-better-code).

3. **Metaphors/User Stories** - client's description of a task. Aim to take down the main points

4. **Validation Tests** - To find out more about Validation Tests see [Rules To Better Website Development](/rules-to-better-website-development-asp-net).

5. **[The 2 key reports](/reports-do-you-schedule-the-burndown-and-stories-overview-reports-to-be-emailed-to-the-team-every-day)**
    * Burndown
    * Stories Overview

Here are the rules we don't agree with:

1. Physical Cards - emails are much better
2. Pair Programming:
    * XP says 2 people at one PC - we have two developers on their own PC's sitting next to each other.
    * We fix production code in pairs. 'Too Expensive' some say. Yes it's pricey, but it's better quality.
