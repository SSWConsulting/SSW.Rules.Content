The Upsizing Tools do not try to upsize Microsoft Access query that includes VBA function names that don't have their equivalent Transact-SQL functions. The upsizing result will depend on Microsoft Access version (2000/2002/2003) and SQL Server Version (2000/2005). The following varieties of queries will not upsize:

<!--endintro-->

- Queries referencing value in control, for example Forms![FormName]![ControlName] (Access 2000)
- Select queries that take parameters (Access 2000)
- Select queries where parameter used more than once (All versions of Access)
- Select queries referencing Format function (All versions of Access)

You have to manually edit SQL definition in Microsoft Access (remove or replace keyword) and modify view/stored procedure/function T-SQL in SQL Server after upsizing.

```sql
SELECT Orders.OrderID,
    "Order Subtotals".Subtotal,
     FORMAT (ShippedDate,'yyyy') AS Year
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN "Order Subtotals"
    ON (Orders.OrderID="Order Subtotals".OrderID);
```

```sql
SELECT Orders.OrderID,
    "Order Subtotals".Subtotal,
     YEAR (ShippedDate) AS [Year]
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN "Order Subtotals"
    ON (Orders.OrderID="Order Subtotals".OrderID)
```
