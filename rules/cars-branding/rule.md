It's a good idea to brand company's cars when they're on the road. These cars are essentially moving billboards for the company.

To get more branded cars, you can [reward employees to brand their personal cars](https://my.sugarlearning.com/SSW/items/10636/car-stickers). 

Make sure the cars look nice with the current company logo and tagline!
