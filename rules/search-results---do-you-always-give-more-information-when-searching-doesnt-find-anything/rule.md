<span class='intro'> <div class="page" title="Page 4"><div><div><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">When you ring up a company and ask “do you sell boxes?” it is not expected to hear them
say “no” and hang up.&#160;They should answer the question and suggestion something, for example&#58; “No, but we sell
plastic containers, would you like that instead?”
​</p></div></div><div><div><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Websites should do the same by giving more information instead of just say “404 – page not&#160;found” or “your search did not match anything”. It can be a simple “Try one of these instead”&#160;giving a number of links.&#160;​</p></div></div></div> </span>
