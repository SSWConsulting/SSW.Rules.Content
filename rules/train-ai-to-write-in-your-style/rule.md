## Steps to Train AI in Your Style

1. **Provide Writing Samples**:
   * Share several pieces of your writing with the AI.
   * Ask the AI to analyze the provided samples for key elements.
   * Example: ""Analyze the following article(s) for tone, sentence structure, humor, readability level, vocabulary, and emotional conveyance."

2. **Generate a Summary**:
   * Request a summary of the identified elements to ensure accuracy.
   * Example: "Provide a 200-word summary of the writing style based on the analysis."

3. **Content Creation Prompt**:
   * Use a specific prompt to generate new content in your style.
   * Example: "Based on the writing style analyzed from the provided article, create content titled 'The Benefits of Remote Work' at 1000 words. Ensure that the new content strictly adheres to the author's writing style in terms of tone, structure, and approach as identified in the analysis."
