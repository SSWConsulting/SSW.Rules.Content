The Scrum Master plays a key role in the Scrum framework by scheduling and facilitating 3 crucial meetings: the Sprint **Review**, **Retrospective**, and **Planning**. These meetings are essential for reviewing progress, reflecting on performance, and planning future work, helping the team stay aligned and continuously improve.

<!--endintro-->

The Scrum Master should estimate how much time each meeting will require, then schedule a single calendar appointment to cater to the 3 meetings. When scheduling the calendar appointment, keep in mind the following:

* Ideally, each of the 3 meetings should be time-boxed to an hour for every week of their associated Sprint
* This timeboxing does not mean the whole time will be taken up, just that you should not let the time for each meeting be exceeded
* With the Product Owner's help, the Scrum Team will need some time to update the Product Backlog after the Retrospective and before the Planning meeting
* People need breaks
* The Sprint officially finishes at the end of the Sprint Retrospective meeting. The Sprint Planning meeting marks the beginning of the next Sprint
* These meetings do not necessarily have to be held on a Friday or Monday. You can have a Sprint starting/ending on any day of the week
  * In fact, mid-week meetings are recommended so that the likelihood of it occurring on a public holiday long weekend is minimized
* Since these meetings will occur every Sprint - set a recurrence on the calendar appointment (every 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks) so that people have the time blocked out well in advance

**Tip:** It can be helpful to finish the Sprint Planning meeting with the first Daily Scrum.

Schedule the meeting and invite the Scrum Team and any interested stakeholders.

### Hi Team,

* Product Owner: {{ PRODUCT OWNER }}
* Scrum Master: {{ SCRUM MASTER }}
* Sprint Length: {{ NUMBER OF WEEKS }} weeks

This is a calendar appointment to hold the following 3 Scrum meetings:

**Sprint Review Meeting**

We will go through the user stories that have been completed and demonstrate them.  
See rule [What happens at a Sprint Review Meeting?](/do-you-know-what-happens-at-a-sprint-review-meeting)

**Sprint Retrospective Meeting**

Sprint closed and new Sprint starts.  
We ask for feedback of the previous Sprint so that we can ‘Inspect and Adapt’.  
See rule [What happens at a Sprint Retrospective Meeting?](/do-you-know-what-happens-at-a-sprint-retrospective-meeting)

**Sprint Planning Meeting**

We go through the backlog (aka to-do list), get more information, estimate and then prioritize.   
We then breakdown to tasks and commit to what we believe we can deliver for the next Sprint.   
See the rule [What happens at a Sprint Planning Meeting?](/what-happens-at-a-sprint-planning-meeting)

Regards,
{{ SCRUM MASTER }}
