​​​​​The Scrum Master (not ScrumMaster), must schedule the Sprint Review, Retrospective and Planning meetings.<br>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>Estimate how much time each meeting will require, then schedule a single calendar appointment to cater to the three meetings. When scheduling the calendar appointment, keep in mind the following:</p><ul><li>Ideally, each of the three meetings should be time-boxed to an hour for every week of their associated Sprint.</li><li>This timeboxing does not mean the whole time will be taken up, just that you should not let the time for each meeting be exceeded.</li><li>With the Product Owner's help, the Scrum Team will need some time to update the Product Backlog after the Retrospective and before the Planning meeting.</li><li>People need breaks.</li><li>The Sprint officially finishes at the end of the Sprint Retrospective meeting. The Sprint Planning meeting marks the beginning of the next Sprint.</li><li>These meetings do not necessarily have to be held on a Friday or Monday. You can have a Sprint start and end on any day of the week.​<br>Mid week meetings are recommended so that the likelihood of it occurring on a public holiday long weekend is minimised.<br></li><li>Since these meetings will occur every Sprint - set a recurrence on the calendar appointment (every 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks)​ so that people have the time blocked out well in advance.​<br></li></ul><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P"> 
   <b>Tip: </b>It can be helpful to finish the Sprint Planning meeting with the first Daily Scrum​</p><p>Schedule the meeting and invite the Scrum Team and any interested stakeholders.</p><div><div class="ms-rteCustom-GreyBox"><p>
