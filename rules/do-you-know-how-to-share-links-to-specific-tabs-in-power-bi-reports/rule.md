<span class='intro'> The problem with the standard File | Publish to Web options, is it always goes​ to the same tab of a report, but if you want to send a link to a specific tab, you have to do one more step...<br> </span>

<p>Do the above as usual, and then go to that published public report, and navigate to the tab you want to send people to.&#160;</p><p>At the bottom right hand corner of the screen, there is a share icon. Click this for a sharable&#160;URL for that tab (people can still navigate to other tabs as needed, but will start on the one you've chosen.<br></p><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"><img src="/PublishingImages/Power%20BI%20-%20Share%20Tab.png" alt="Power BI - Share Tab.png" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;808px;" /></dl><p><br></p>
