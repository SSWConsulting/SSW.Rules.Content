<p>Do the above as usual, and then go to that published public report, and navigate to the tab you want to send people to.&#160;</p><p>At the bottom right hand corner of the screen, there is a share icon. Click this for a sharable&#160;URL for that tab (people can still navigate to other tabs as needed, but will start on the one you've chosen.<br></p><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea">​<br><img src="Power%20BI%20-%20Share%20Tab.png" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;808px;" />​<br></dl>
