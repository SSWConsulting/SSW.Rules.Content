If a product owner sends an email to the development team with a request, that email should be turned into an Azure DevOps Work Item before any work is started or the work is prioritized on the backlog.

<!--endintro-->
<dl><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">If the email's contents or subject do not need changing, then no response email is required. This would create another unnecessary email in the world.<br></p></dl>
However, if the subject is unclear, send a response as per the rules [Do you know when you should change a subject?](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=5df965e4-26d3-410d-88a9-880dde8f4353) and [Do you realize the importance of a good email Subject?](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=f4073e2a-b089-4a7f-8ee6-a7b1a48509e8)

If the request from the client is too large for one Work Item, then it will need to be turned into multiple Work Items as per the rule  [Do you keep your PBIs smaller than 2 days' effort?](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=c0d01e55-619e-4f99-a480-6c9f0bfe9855) In this case, you will need to let the client know this and include URLs to each Work Item.

**Note:** Once you've moved the email into Azure DevOps as a work item, you should delete the original email from your inbox or move it to an Outlook folder called "Moved to Azure DevOps" to avoid duplication.
