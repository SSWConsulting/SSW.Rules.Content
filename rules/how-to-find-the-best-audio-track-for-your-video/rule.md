You should never use any copyrighted work without permission. When it comes to videos, if you have licensed music or songs on your YouTube video, it might be entirely removed from the site. To avoid this, use  **royalty free** music.

### Royalty Free Music 

There are many options available for purchasing high-quality royalty free music.

The three we use at SSW are [Audionetwork](https://au.audionetwork.com/) (recommended), [audiojungle.net](https://audiojungle.net/), and [Art List Music](https://artlist.io/).

Audionetwork is the best option because it provides more and better music and is faster to edit with variations on instrumentation and durations plus higher quality WAV format files for each song. The user interface is good (could be better no doubt ðŸ˜‰) customer service is great too, with an Account Manager available to assist.  This library is used by major production companies and broadcasters around the world (UK based).

Artlist is more limited but we have a subscription to sound effects which can be useful.

Audio Jungle is great for finding sound effects and [Foley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foley_%28filmmaking%29) sounds. You can also find many great full-length songs that suit corporate video. However, the music style is typically geared towards online ads and marketing videos and doesn't quite have that 'professional' sound you get from bands and mainstream artists.

If you want audio that sounds more like professional music created by bands and artists but still designed for corporate, then use Art List Music.
