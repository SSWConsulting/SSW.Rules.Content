<span class='intro'> Azure transactions are CHEAP. You get tens of thousands for just a few cents. What is dangerous though is that it is very easy to have your application generate hundreds of thousands of transactions a day. </span>

<p>Every call to Windows Azure Blobs, Tables and Queues count as 1 transaction. Windows Azure diagnostic logs, performance counters, trace statements and IIS logs are written to Table Storage or Blob Storage.</p>
<p>If you are unaware of this, it can quickly add up and either burn through your free trial account, or even create a large unexpected bill.</p>
<p><strong>Note&#58;</strong> Azure Storage Transactions do not count calls to SQL Azure.</p>
<h2>Ensure that Diagnostics are Disabled for your web and worker roles</h2>
<p>Having Diagnostics enabled can contribute 25 transactions per minute, this is 36,000 transactions per day.</p>
<p>Question for Microsoft&#58; Is this per Web Role?</p>

<h2>Disable IntelliTrace and Profiling</h2>

<h2>Robots.txt </h2>
<p>Search bots crawling your site to index it will lead to a lot of transactions. Especially for web &quot;applications&quot; that do not need to be searchable, use Robot.txt to save transactions.</p>

<span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; Place robots.txt in the root of your site to control search engine indexing</span>

<h2>Continuous Deployment</h2>
<p>When deploying to Azure, the deployment package is loaded into the Storage Account. This will also contribute to the transaction count.</p>
<p>If you have enabled continuous deployment to Azure, you will need to monitor your transaction usage carefully.</p>
