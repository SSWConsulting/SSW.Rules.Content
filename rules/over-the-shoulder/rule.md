An "over-the-shoulder" review is one of the best ways to avoid [merge debt](/merge-debt). When a pull request (PR) is ready to be reviewed, get someone with you either in-person or on call, and go through the PR together. This not only allows you to demo the content of the PR but also talk with the person taking feedback when needed.

::: info
**Note:** You should always avoid merge debt, it's your responsibility to follow up on your PRs and get them merged as soon as possible. For more info,
