Its go time - teams have been allocated and the day has arrived. Here is the agenda.

- **8:00 am** - 🤝 Meet at the Brainstorming venue - we will have breakfast ready and order coffees
- **8:05 am** – 🙋 Introduction, a run through of the day and a summary of the retro
- **9:00 am** - 🧑‍💻 Start working on your project
- **1:00 pm** – 🍴 Lunch
- **2:00 pm** - ✨ Finish polishing presentation - have done a run through, have decided who presents
- **2:30 pm** - 🧪 Do Test Please then a [tech check](/tech-check) with the TV team (The recording is more important than the live audience, working with mics is also great practice for when you are on site with a client)
- **3:30 pm** - 🎤 Start presentations (Tip: Start presentations earlier/later depending on how many people are attending)
- **6:00 pm** – 🍻 The pub!


On the day, follow the agenda set out in your attendee email:

- Have the 2nd Microsoft Form showing on a projector.
- 8 am: Welcome everyone and thank those that submitted ideas.
- Call out who the scribe is. (They will update the GitHub Discussions in the background).
- Split into teams: work through the list of ideas in the Microsoft Form starting with the most popular one. Ask the attendees to gather in a group if they want to join that team.
- Create Microsoft Team: Now that you have the groups, create a Microsoft Team and a channel for each group. Then attendees can store documents (e.g. their presentation) in that team and set to work building a prototype or proof of concept.
- 1 pm: Give the attendees a break for lunch.
- 3 pm: Attendees come back in, and each group takes turns presenting their work to the rest of the attendees.

**Note**: The top-voted suggestion may not be technical, and the prototype or proof of concept doesn't have to be a technical solution. It could very well be a prototype application or website, but equally could be a new business process or a video.
