If you call a client or team member, and for some reason they do not attend your call, then leave a message to ensure a response.  

The advantages of leaving messages when your call is unanswered:

* They will know who called and be able to return your call
* If your message is urgent, they may return your call straight away (even though they're busy)

<!--endintro-->

Your messages must contain:

- Your first name and last name
- Purpose of calling
- Your contact number

Create a sense of urgency by giving them explicit time frames when you are available.
