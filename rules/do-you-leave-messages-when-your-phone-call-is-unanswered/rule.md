If you call a client or team member, and for some reasons he/she do not attend your call, then you MUST leave messages to ensure a response.  
<!--endintro-->

Your messages must contain     ***your name (firstname and lastname)***,     ***purpose of calling***, and***your contact number***. Create a sense of urgency by giving them explicit time frames when you are available.
*Hi Ms. Emma, this is Alvin. Please call me back, thanks.*
**Figure: Bad Example - lacking in communication details, reason for calling and sense of urgency**
*Hi Ms. Emma, this is Alvin Shen from SSW. I am calling to follow up our meeting yesterday about your company website. Please return my call on 02 9953 3000. The best time to reach me is between 9 and 11am today, or between 3 and 5pm tomorrow. My number again is 02 9953 3000.Â Thank you.* 
**Figure: Good Example - This communicates important contact details, a reason for calling and implies a response is needed in the next day or so**

Confirm the voice message with an email.

There are several advantages leaving messages when your call is unanswered:

* He/she may know who calls and be able to return your call.
* If your message is urgent, he/she may return your call straight away (even though he/she is VERY busy.
