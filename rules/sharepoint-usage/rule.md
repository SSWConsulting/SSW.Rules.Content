Usage analytics is quite important - it allows you to identify popular and unused pages or sites, but also helps measuring users' engagement.

There are three places to check for Usage reports in SharePoint

1. Page Usage

2. Site Usage

Site owners can access global site usage reports:

3. Tenant Usage

This is by far the most interesting and import report. You need special (tenant-level) permissions to access those usage reports (https://admin.microsoft.com/?source=applauncher#/reportsUsage/SharePointActivityV1)

⚠ You will need SysAdmin help to get access to those reports⚠
