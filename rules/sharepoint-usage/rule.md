Usage analytics is quite important - it allows you to identify popular and unused pages or sites, but also helps measuring users' engagement.

There are 3 places to check for Usage reports in SharePoint:

1. Page Usage

2. Site Usage

Site owners can access global site usage reports:

3. Tenant Usage

This is by far the most interesting and import report. You need special (tenant-level) permissions to access those usage reports
