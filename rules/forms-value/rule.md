Microsoft Forms provide an invaluable way for collecting data from your employees, users and other stakeholders. It is important to make sure you have metrics for measuring the value of your forms so that you make better decisions about content in the future. However, how can you accomplish this? 

Let's take a look...

There are 2 steps to getting objective data about forms.

### 1 - Measure the value

The best way to measure value is simply to ask your users. Put a question at the bottom of your form and ask them to give it a rating out of 5. Make sure to always word this question the same way so that you can easily consolidate the results in a reporting platform like PowerBI.

### 2 - Educate the users

However, simply asking the question is not enough. Most people will answer a form with 4 or 5 by default, so it is important to educate your users and let them know to try and objectively rate it relative to past forms.

If they feel a form was low value compared to previous entries, then they should give it a 1 or a 2. 

If it's a good form then 4 might be appropriate. 

5 should be reserved for oustanding forms.

If you educate the users about this, your data is going to be much more reflective of the actual value each form gives.
