Please don't say just 'Hello' in chat. It's as if you called someone on the phone and said "Hi!" and then put them on hold!

When you do that, you're simply making the other person wait for you to phrase your question, which generates low productivity.

<!--endintro-->

Now that you've avoided just saying hello, if you're calling them, [just be sure to give them a warning](/warn-then-call)
