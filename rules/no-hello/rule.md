**Figure:** Hear from Adam Cogan as he talks about a common mistake on IM - just saying "Hey" or "Hello" without explaining the context.

Please don't say just 'Hello' in chat. It's as if you called someone on the phone and said "Hi!" and then put them on hold!

When someone does that they're simply making the other person wait for you to phrase your question, which generates low productivity.

<!--endintro-->

The same goes for:

* "Hey, are you there?" 
* "Hi Bob, do you have a sec?"
* "Ping"

Instead of doing this, just ask the question! 

Asking your question before getting any reply allows **asynchronous communication**. If the other party is away, and you leave before they come back, they can still answer your question, instead of just staring at a "Hello" and wondering what they missed.

Even better, don't start cold if the conversation has a history... Remember everyone likes breathing space, so say:

* "Calling in 5 minutes. See the PBI: \[URL]
* "Calling in 5 minutes. See email subjecT: \[Email subject]
