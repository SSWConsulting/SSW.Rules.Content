Please don't say just 'Hello' in chat. It's as if you called someone on the phone and said "Hi!" and then put them on hold!

When someone does that they're simply making the other person wait for you to phrase your question, which generates low productivity.

**[Historical Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omuzBQaPQjw): Hear from Adam Cogan as he talks about a common mistake on IM - just saying "Hey" or "Hello" without explaining the context.**

<!--endintro-->

The same goes for:

:::greybox
"Hey, are you there?" 
:::
:::bad
Bad example - You're left waiting for a response
:::

:::greybox
"Hi Bob, do you have a sec?"
:::
:::bad
Bad example - No context
:::

:::greybox
"Ping"
:::
:::bad
Bad example - They're left waiting for you to ask a question
:::

Instead of doing this, just ask the question! 

:::greybox
"CTF Form Review - are you free in 30 mins?"
:::
:::good
Good example - You have given immediate context
:::

Asking your question before getting any reply allows **asynchronous communication**. If the other party is away, and you leave before they come back, they can still answer your question, instead of just staring at a "Hello" and wondering what they missed.

There are 2 situations where you want to message someone. Quick simple questions and more complex ones that need a discussion.

##  Simple - Make your questions easy to respond to 

For simple questions, try to phrase it so they have easy options, then you can get away with asking these over text chat. 

Try to give 2 options and ask them to thumbs upüëç their preferred option. That makes it as simple as possible to respond so you can even catch people who are extremely busy!

![Figure: ‚úÖ Good example - the question and options are easy for a busy person to action ](no-hello.jpg)

## Complex - start a call warm, not cold

If your conversation requires a discussion, then it's time to initiate a call. If the conversation has history, like a PBI or email, then it's important to include that context. That way the other person can prioritise your call. 

For example, if you mention that you want to talk about an email from several years ago they might think it isn't that important.

Conversely, if you mention the production server is down, they will almost definitely answer you!

Other reasons for this:

* It is important to go the extra mile when you are asking someone else for something‚Ä¶ so be as considerate as possible
* It puts you into their chat history, so even if they decline the call, they can easily write back to you to explain why
* Giving someone even a 1 minute warning is a good idea even if you see their Teams Status is on green ‚Äòavailable‚Äô. Remember it is not easy to always change their status to ‚Äòbusy‚Äô - they could be on a mobile phone, on a WhatsApp call, in a physical meeting, etc.

Also, everyone likes breathing space, so try to give about a minute's warning for any call.

:::
:::good
Good example - Has a task, and gives context by sharing the email to a teams chat
:::

:::greybox
Please action email subject: **{{Email subject}}**  

I'll call in 1 minute to follow up.
:::
:::good
Good example - Has a task, and gives context
:::

:::greybox
Calling in 1 minute. See the PBI:

**{{URL}}**
:::
:::good
Good example - Has context and doesn't leave anyone waiting
:::

**Tip:** For the example above, PBIs often have long URLs. Break a line for better readability.

### What if your call is declined?

When a call is declined, it is important to follow up in order to ensure the task remains a priority and does not get forgotten.

:::greybox
"Tried to call - will try again in 1 hour"
:::
:::bad
Good example - send them a message indicating you will try again later
:::

**Tip:** The [follow-up effectively](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/follow-up-effectively/) rule will help you remember to call.
