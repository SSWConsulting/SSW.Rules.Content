Please don't say just 'Hello' in chat. It's as if you called someone on the phone and said "Hi!" and then put them on hold!

When someone does that they're simply making the other person wait for you to phrase your question, which generates low productivity.

**Video: Hear from Adam Cogan as he talks about a common mistake on IM - just saying "Hey" or "Hello" without explaining the context.**

<!--endintro-->

The same goes for:

:::greybox
"Hey, are you there?" 
:::
:::bad
Bad example - You're left waiting for a response  
:::

:::greybox
"Hi Bob, do you have a sec?"
:::
:::bad
Bad example - No context  
:::

:::greybox
"Ping"
:::
:::bad
Bad example - They're left waiting for you to ask a question  
:::

Instead of doing this, just ask the question! 

Asking your question before getting any reply allows **asynchronous communication**. If the other party is away, and you leave before they come back, they can still answer your question, instead of just staring at a "Hello" and wondering what they missed.

Even better, don't start cold if the conversation has a history... Remember everyone likes breathing space, so say:

:::greybox
Please action email subject: **{{Email subject}}**  
  
I'll call in 5 minutes to follow up.
:::
:::good
Good example - Has a task, and gives context  
:::

:::greybox
Calling in 5 minutes. See the PBI:   
**{{URL}}**
:::
:::good
Good example - Has context and doesn't leave anyone waiting
:::

**Tip:** For the example above, PBIs often have long URLs. Break a line for better readability.
