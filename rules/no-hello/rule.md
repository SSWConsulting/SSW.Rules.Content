Please don't say just 'Hello' in chat. It's as if you called someone on the phone and said "Hi!" and then put them on hold!

When someone does that they're simply making the other person wait for you to phrase your question, which generates low productivity.

**Video: Hear from Adam Cogan as he talks about a common mistake on IM - just saying "Hey" or "Hello" without explaining the context.**

<!--endintro-->

The same goes for:

:::greybox
"Hey, are you there?" 
:::
:::bad
Bad example - You're left waiting for a response
:::

:::greybox
"Hi Bob, do you have a sec?"
:::
:::bad
Bad example - No context
:::

:::greybox
"Ping"
:::
:::bad
Bad example - They're left waiting for you to ask a question
:::

Instead of doing this, just ask the question! 

Asking your question before getting any reply allows **asynchronous communication**. If the other party is away, and you leave before they come back, they can still answer your question, instead of just staring at a "Hello" and wondering what they missed.


There are 2 situations where you want to message someone. Quick simple questions and more complex ones that need a discussion.

### Simple questions

For simple questions, you can get away with asking the question over text chat. 

Try to make your question a yes/no question so it is simple to answer. Even better ask the person to react with üëç thumbs up for yes or üò° angry face for no. That makes it as simple as possible to respond so you can even catch people who are extremely busy!

Initial Meeting with Uly - Is it a higher priority than fixing the production website?

üëçThumbs up for yes

üò°Angry face for no

:::
:::good
Good example - The question is as simple as possible to respond to, making it easy for a busy person to action
:::

### Complex questions
If your conversation requires a discussion, then it's time to initiate a call. If the conversation has history, like a PBI or email, then it's important to include that context. That way the other person can prioritise your call. 

For example, if you mention that you want to talk about an email from several years ago they might think it isn't that important.

Conversely, if you mention the production server is down, they will almost definitely answer you!

Also everyone likes breathing space, so try to give a few minutes warning for any call.

:::greybox
Please action email subject: **{{Email subject}}**  

I'll call in 5 minutes to follow up.
:::
:::good
Good example - Has a task, and gives context
:::

:::greybox
Calling in 5 minutes. See the PBI:
**{{URL}}**
:::
:::good
Good example - Has context and doesn't leave anyone waiting
:::

**Tip:** For the example above, PBIs often have long URLs. Break a line for better readability.
