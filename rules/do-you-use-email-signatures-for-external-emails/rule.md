  <p>Email signatures are a great way of adding some advertising and branding to a medium which isn't seen as too obtrusive. E.g. A URL in footer from your friend isn't as taboo as junk mail from an unknown company. <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulestoBetterBranding.aspx#EmailSignatures">Details</a> </p>

  <p>NOTE&#58; Delete your footer when you send emails internally, it's unnecessary. </p>
<p>If you are on site at a customer, you want colleagues to be able to give you a call without asking the office what your mobile number is. In this case, you should include your mobile and/or temp number for internal emails (e.g.Jonny Trees | On Site | 0412 xxx xxx). </p>
