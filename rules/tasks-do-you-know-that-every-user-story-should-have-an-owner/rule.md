  <p>When you are building complicated software and working with customers it is always nice for them to have some idea on who to speak to about a particular story during a sprint. 
</p>

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <p>In order to achieve this entire the Team takes responsibility for “looking after” a story and manages it to completion. <br>
<br>
During the sprint one of the team&#160;will be the first person to&#160;answer any Product Owner queries.&#160;&#160;That person is assigned to the&#160;story&#160;</p>

<strong class="ms-rteCustom-FigureGood">Figure&#58; Good example, the product owner can now see who he should speak to and developers know where to send done emails.</strong></p>
