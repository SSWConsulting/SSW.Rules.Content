Most companies do great work for clients — but fail to share it. Meanwhile, marketing teams struggle to produce content that feels real, useful, or relevant. The problem? They're not close enough to the work.

By running quarterly marketing meetings with your account managers, you create a feedback loop that surfaces the most impressive client stories. Even better, by bringing in the developers who built the solution, you can turn those stories into rich, technical case studies that educate, impress, and convert.

## Why this matters

Account managers know *what* was built and *why* it mattered to the client. Developers know *how* it was built, including the tough decisions, technical constraints, and clever solutions. Marketing needs both sides of the story to craft high-quality content that:

- Builds trust with prospects
- Attracts developers and talent
- Strengthens your brand as a problem-solver

## What the meeting should look like

These meetings should happen every quarter and follow a simple format.

### Attendees

- Marketing team (1–2 reps)
- All account managers
- Optionally the dev manager or team leads

### Agenda

::: greybox
1. Account managers each share 1–2 recent client wins or cool solutions delivered
2. Marketing asks follow-up questions to assess if a story is "case study worthy"
3. Identify the key developers involved and invite them to a follow-up deep dive
4. Capture next steps (e.g. interview scheduled, quote approval, screenshots)

### Pro Tip: Look for stories with these elements

- A real client challenge (business or technical)
- A clever, non-obvious solution
- Results the client loved (faster, simpler, smarter)
- A dev who can explain the "how" in plain English

## Follow-up process

Once a good story is identified, don't let it fade. Assign a content owner to:

1. Interview the developer (record the session)
2. Write the first draft of the case study
3. Get review and sign-off from the dev and client
4. Publish and promote (blog, newsletter, social)

## Why this works

- Developers are more engaged when talking about real work they’re proud of
- Marketing avoids fluff and gets real, technical stories
- Clients see their success being showcased (which builds loyalty)
- Sales has powerful proof to share with prospects

By setting up these quarterly meetings, you make case studies part of your company rhythm — not just a wishlist item.
