When following best practices and using dependency injection, you will often find yourself with a class that has a lot of properties that are only set once, in the constructor. This can lead to a lot of boilerplate code that is not needed. C#12 introduces Primary Constructors, which allow you to define the constructor and the properties in one place.

<!--endintro-->

```cs
public class Hero
{
    public Hero(string name, string power, string city)
    {
        _name = name;
        _power = power;
        _city = city;
    }

    private readonly string _name;
    private readonly string _power;
    private readonly string _city;

    public override string ToString() => $"{_name} has {_power} and lives in {_city}";
}
```

::: bad
Figure: Bad example - large amount of boiler plate code needed to store injected properties.  
:::

```cs
public class Hero(string name, string power, string city)
{
    public override string ToString() => $"{name} has {power} and lives in {city}";
}
```

In the example above we the `Hero` class has access to the parameters passed into the Primary Constructor so we don't need to store them in private fields. We can use them directly in the `ToString()` method.
