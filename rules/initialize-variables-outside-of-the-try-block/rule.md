You should initialize variables outside of the try block.

<!--endintro-->

```csharp
Cursor cur;

try {
  // ...
  cur = Cursor.Current; //Bad Code - initializing the variable inside the try block
  Cursor.Current = Cursors.WaitCursor;
  // ...
} finally {
  Cursor.Current = cur;
}
```

::: bad
Bad Example: Because of the initializing code inside the try block. If it failed on this line then you will get a NullReferenceException in Finally

:::

```csharp
Cursor cur = Cursor.Current; //Good Code - initializing the variable outside the try block

try {
  // ...
  Cursor.Current = Cursors.WaitCursor;
  // ...
} finally {
  Cursor.Current = cur;
}
```

::: good
Good Example : Because the initializing code is outside the try block
