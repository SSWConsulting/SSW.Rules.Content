You should remember that any point of contact leaves an impression on clients or customers so even the answering service on your phones should be taken into consideration. 

Your personal mobile phone should have a standard answering message for any missed calls.  Many people don't use voice mail these days, so you may as well tell people about it. Also, if you don't mind it is nice to include subtle company branding.

**Figure: Bad example**

> "Hi, you've reached Adam Cogan from SSW.  I don't use voice mail, so please send an SMS.  Thanks!"

**Figure: Good example**
