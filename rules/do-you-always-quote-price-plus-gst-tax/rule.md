Is your price:

* $100 per hour + GST (the $100 being the amount exclusive of GST)
* $110 per hour (the $110 being the total amount)


<!--endintro-->

We say the first one. When providing quotes to prospects/clients, it is always better to display the net value + 10% GST rather than the total.

The reasons for this are:

* It avoids any confusion as to whether GST is included.
* This net amount is the REAL cost to the customer, as they get the tax back (in Australia).
* The net value is lower and appears more attractive to the client.
* The 10% GST charged to the client is not income for your company. In Australia, we collect this 10% on behalf of the Australian Taxation Office.
* The client will receive back this 10% GST from the Australian Tax Office when they do their quarterly BAS/GST Return.

      The total fixed price total is $AUD 66,000 - please find quote attached.      Bad Example        The total fixed price total is $AUD 60,000 + GST (10%). Please find quote attached.      Good Example   
**Note** : SSW and other Australian companies do not charge GST to external clients outside of Australia.

While you are writing out a quote, make sureÂ [you know when to use a round or exact figure](/do-you-know-when-to-use-a-round-figure-or-an-exact-figure).
