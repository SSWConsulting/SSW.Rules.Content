<p>Webinars involve a lot of preparation from all parties. In order for a webinar to be run as successfully as possible there are some deadlines which should be met.&#160;</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p></p><p>Webinars should be scheduled at least one month in advance, wherever possible there should be at least two webinars scheduled in advance at any time. </p><p>After confirming with a presenter an 'As per our conversation' email should be sent requesting the title and description of the webinar. These details should be provided no later than three weeks prior to the event so that landing pages can be created. This also allows for&#160;two weeks of promotion to be carried out, ensuring the best attendance rate is achieved.&#160;​</p><p>Video files&#160;should be sent to the TV team two weeks prior to the event, this allows for any editing that needs to be done and prevents cancellation at the last minute.</p>
