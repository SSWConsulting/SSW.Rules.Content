<span class='intro'> 
  <p>Many developers worry about Idempotency. They make sure that their scripts can run multiple times without it affecting the database, upon subsequent running of the script. </p>
<p>This usually involves a&#160;check at the start to see if the object exists or not. <br>
eg. If this table exists, then don't create the table.<br>
<br>
Seems popular, seems like a good idea, right?&#160; Wrong! And here is why.</p>
 </span>


  <p>Database scripts should be run in order (into separate sequential files),&#160;as per the rule&#160;<a shape="rect" href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/standards/rules/rulestobettersqlserverdatabases.aspx#ScriptOutChanges">Do you script out all changes?</a><br>
<br>
Therefore developers should not worry about idempotency, as the script will run in the order it was created. Actually, if they are doing this, then <strong>*they want to see the errors*</strong>. It means that the database is not in the state that they expect.</p>
