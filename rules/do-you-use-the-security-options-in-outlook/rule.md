When you distribute important information by email all you can do is put &quot;Do Not Forward this please&quot;. Important corporate information should be protected better than this. <br>

<p>A solution exists in Microsoft Office 2003 which you will see built into Outlook 2003 (and the rest of Office [except Access]), entitled 'Information Rights Management', a file level security application built onto Windows Server 2003. The capability enables you to prevent recipients of your emails (and attachments) from forwarding them on, copying any text, or printing the document (be aware that determined chaps could use a lower level screen shot program to get past this). Additionally, it encrypts the file as it's sent away. As an added basis - you can secure on a group level (based on Active Directory groups). </p>
<p>If you're not running Office 2003 install the <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Redirect/Microsoft/Office2003IRMDownload.htm">IRM for Internet Explorer download</a> <img height="11" width="17" alt="Leave Site" src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Images/LeaveSite.gif" /> </p>
<p>BTW you may be interested to know that every mail item that you send gets a file saved with these credentials so you can still open the emails when you are offline. To see&#58; go to Start - Run %USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\drm.</p>
