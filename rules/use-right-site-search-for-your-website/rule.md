If you prefer a free and more customized option, both Typesense and Meilisearch are good choices to consider.
Elasticsearch is effective and particularly good at searching and analyzing logs. You can use it for on-site searches too, but unless your website is huge, using Elasticsearch might be excessive, and setting it up could get very complicated.
