When businesses adopt AI, they face significant security risks. For example, many companies that experiment with AI face issues like data breaches, unauthorized access, or even the unintentional exposure of sensitive customer information. These risks can lead to significant financial and reputational damage.
 
It's critical to understand these risks upfront and take active steps to manage them, ensuring your AI adoption journey is secure from start to finish.

## Common security risks in AI adoption
 
* **Data Breaches** - AI systems rely heavily on data, often requiring vast amounts of personal and business information. If improperly secured, these systems can become targets for hackers, leading to sensitive data being stolen or leaked.
   
* **Unauthorized Access** - If access controls are not stringent, attackers or even internal users might exploit vulnerabilities in AI systems to gain access to information or systems they shouldn’t have access to
   
* **AI Model Manipulation (e.g., adversarial attacks)** - AI models can be manipulated by adversarial inputs that trick the AI into making incorrect or harmful decisions. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by bad actors to subvert your AI’s intended functionality
 
## How to manage security risks

### 1. Implement robust access controls

Ensure that only authorized users have access to your AI models and data. This includes using multi-factor authentication (MFA) and role-based access controls (RBAC).

Require all internal and external users to use MFA before accessing any AI tools or sensitive datasets.

### 2. Regularly test for vulnerabilities

Use automated tools, such as **red teaming** and vulnerability scanning, to identify security weaknesses in your AI systems. These tools simulate cyberattacks on your AI infrastructure, helping you to identify and fix potential security holes before real attackers find them.

::: greybox
Run automated red teaming simulations quarterly to test for AI system vulnerabilities.

### 3. Encrypt data and AI models

Encrypt both data at rest and data in transit to ensure that sensitive information remains secure even if accessed by unauthorized individuals. Additionally, ensure AI models themselves are encrypted to prevent unauthorized manipulation or theft.

::: greybox
Implement end-to-end encryption for all data flows related to your AI system.

### 4. Monitor AI system activity

Continuous monitoring of AI systems is crucial for detecting unusual activities that might signal a security breach. Implement real-time logging and alerting mechanisms to track access, inputs, and outputs of your AI models.

::: greybox
Set up a monitoring dashboard that tracks AI model activity, including data access logs and API requests.

By proactively addressing these security risks, you can protect your business and customers from the potential pitfalls of adopting AI solutions. Managing security risks ensures your AI tools remain safe, reliable, and trusted by your stakeholders.
