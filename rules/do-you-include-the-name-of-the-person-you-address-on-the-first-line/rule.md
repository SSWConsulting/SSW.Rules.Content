<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​​If you include more than one person in your email, include the name of the person/s you are addressing on the first line. Generally don't put more than one name in the &quot;To&quot; box, so that people won't have to be unsure to whom the email is addressed. If you have to address multiple people in an email (including yourself - i.e. notes to self), include each person's name as a heading as shown below. This helps them quickly locate the part of the email that applies to them.
