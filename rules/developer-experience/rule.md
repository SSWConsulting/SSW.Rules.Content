It's amazing how often you can't simply Clone a repository (aka "Get Latest") and compile it.

A good developer makes it clear how to get a new project, compile it and run it.

### Sometimes the experience is more CLI based

![Figure: Some consider this rule (Do you get latest and compile) to be more a “git clone” and then “dotnet run”](dotnet-run.png)

### Sometimes the experience is more Mac-based

![Figure: On a MacBook, VSCode has a run button to launch the debugger (similar to F5)](macbook-vscode-run-button.png)
