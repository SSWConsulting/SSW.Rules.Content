Check out these sources to get an understanding of the role of unit testing in delivering high-quality software:

<!--endintro-->

- Read the [Wikipedia Unit test](https://www.ssw.com.au/SSW/Redirect/WikipediaUnitTest.htm) page and learn how to write unit tests on fragile code.
- Read Tim Ottinger & Jeff Langr's [**FIRST** principles of unit tests](http://agileinaflash.blogspot.com/2009/02/first.html) (**F**ast, **I**solated, **R**epeatable, **S**elf-validating, **T**imely) to learn about some common properties of good unit tests.
- Read Bas Dijkstra's [Why I think unit testing is the basis of any solid automation strategy](https://www.ontestautomation.com/why-i-think-unit-testing-is-the-basis-of-any-solid-automation-strategy/) article to understand how a good foundation of unit tests helps you with your automation strategy.
- Read Martin Fowler's [UnitTest](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UnitTest.html) to learn about some different opinions as to what constitutes a "unit".
- Read the short article [100 Percent Unit Test Coverage Is Not Enough](https://www.stickyminds.com/article/100-percent-unit-test-coverage-not-enough) by John Ruberto as a cautionary tale about focusing on test coverage over test quality.

- Read the [Wikipedia Test-driven development](https://www.ssw.com.au/SSW/Redirect/WikipediaTest-drivenDevelopment.htm) page (optional)
- Read the [SSW Rule - Test Please](/conduct-a-test-please-internally-and-then-with-the-client) - we never release un-tested code to a client!
