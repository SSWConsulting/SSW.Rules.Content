Check out the basic readings to get an understanding of quality development:

* Read the [Wikipedia Revision Control](https&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/SSW/Redirect/WikipediaRevisionControl.htm) (use source control for your code - understand "Check-out" and "Check-in")
* Read the [Wikipedia Test-driven development](https&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/SSW/Redirect/WikipediaTest-drivenDevelopment.htm)(optional)
* Read the [SSW Rule - Test Please](/conduct-a-test-please-internally-and-then-with-the-client) (don't release un-tested code to a client)
