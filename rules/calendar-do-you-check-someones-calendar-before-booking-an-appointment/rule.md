If someone has [shared their calendar permissions](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=86a7e3f1-964a-47bc-ba84-d28bd42d3df4) with you, you will be able to check their calendar directly without needing a conversation.
Imagine someone wants to book some time with you. Offer to look up the calendar and book in time straightaway.

                      Bad Example - "Try calling him."

                                              Good Example - "Sure, I'll just look up Adam's calendar and see when he's free. Obviously, it's not a good idea to call Adam now as he is on a plane."
