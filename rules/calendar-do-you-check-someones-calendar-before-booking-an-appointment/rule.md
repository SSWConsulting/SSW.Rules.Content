<p>​
                   Imagine someone wants an appointment with a team member who has <a href="/Management/Rules-to-Better-Software-Consultants-Working-in-a-Team/Pages/Share-your-calendar-with-everyone.aspx">shared their calendar</a> with you. Offer to look up the calendar and book in time straightaway.

                    Sure, I'll just look up Adam's calendar and see when he's free.
