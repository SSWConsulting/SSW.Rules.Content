When you need to identify text that should be replaced (e.g. in an email template), it's important to use a consistent way of indicating the replaceable text.

Use a consistent character to make it clear which piece of text should be substituted.

Angular uses `{{}}` to indicate a variable and we think this is a very clear way to indicate that something needs to be replaced because it is very uncommon to see this syntax outside of Angular code.

`[]` are commonly used to label things. On sensitive emails, the text `[Sec: Official]` gets appended or prefixed to the subject, for example.

Using `[]` for replaceable text can be confusing since there is already the common usage for labelling.

So, SSW uses double curly brackets instead of square brackets to indicate replaceable text.

Replaceable text is often seen in email templates:

::: email-template  
|          |     |
| -------- | --- |
| To:      | \[Client email\] |
| Subject: | \[Project name\] - Test please |  
::: email-content  

### Hi \[Client name\],  

I've been working on \[Project name\] and just deployed version \[Version number\] with the latest requirements.

1. Test please - \[Link\]

Regards,  
\[Your name\]
