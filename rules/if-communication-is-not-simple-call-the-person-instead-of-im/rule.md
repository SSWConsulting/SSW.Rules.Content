<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">When you realize the communication is not simple and there it is going to take much back and forth IMs, say &quot;Can I call?&quot; and continue the conversation through voice.&#160;</p><div><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​​​​Communication using voice is much faster than typing a message and it can clear misunderstandings. Encourage people to switch to voice if possible.<br></p></div>
