When you realize the communication is not simple and there it is going to take much back and forth IMs, say "Can I call?" and continue the conversation through voice.

Communication using voice is much faster than typing a message and it can clear misunderstandings. Encourage people to switch to voice if possible.

Example:


::: greybox
 **- Adam Cogan:**  Did you say to me, you would contact Tiago on Skype to do it collaboratively... rather than email?
 **- Danijel Malik:**  I agreed I'll contact them over Skype as suggested by Drew
 **- Adam Cogan:**  Isn't that what I just said? (and you said you were sending emails)
 **- Danijel Malik:**  Hold on...I don't understand you anymore, <mark>can we switch to voice?</mark>
:::

Then follow [Do you send "As Per Our Conversation" emails?](/do-you-send-as-per-our-conversation-emails)
