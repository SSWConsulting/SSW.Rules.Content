The easiest thing to do is to quote the price in your local currency. Go the extra step and convert it to a currency they understand.

If you are not sure what currency to use, just use US Dollars, which is the international currency.

Of course, if you are dealing with somebody regularly, then you should know their preferred currency.

E.g. Chinese company billing someone in Brazil:

::: greybox
Our price is CNY ¥1,000
:::
::: bad
Figure: Bad example - the client will need to convert it
:::

::: greybox
Our price is CNY ¥1,000 (about USD $160)
:::
::: good
Figure: Good example - USD gives a clear understanding of the costs
