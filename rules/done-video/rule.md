When you've finished a PBI you should record a video to send to your Product Owner and anyone else that is interested. A 'Done' video is much better than a screenshot because you are proving the PBI workflow actually works. Even better, this video can double as documentation or release notes for your users.

<!--endintro-->

When deciding whether a PBI might be a good contender to record a Done Video for, consider these factors:

1. Is it a key piece of functionality that has high business value?
2. Would it be difficult to quickly demo in the Sprint Review without a video?
3. Is it UI heavy? i.e. Would the video be compelling?

## Tip 1: Choose the right software

### To record your screen and camera together

Check out ["Do you know how to record your screen?"](/recording-screen) for the best options.

### To edit your video

* **Basic editing:** Clipchamp, Video Editor (for Windows), iMovie (for Mac)
* **Advanced editing:** Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut, DaVinci Resolve

### How tos

#### Clipchamp

:::info
**Warning:** Clipchamp has a record limit of 30 minutes for a single project. If you are planning on recording several takes, start a new project.

#### OBS Studio

##### For a more professional video that requires some editing

Here's a quick video describing how to record your webcam and screen separately in high-resolution using OBS for post-processing and editing:

::: info
**Note:** You will be able to alter the PIP, remove it, go full screen on your face. Also note that you'll need to **set the output to 30 FPS** in your OBS settings - not 60 FPS as outlined in the video. Setting the output to 30 FPS will ensure you don't experience syncing issues or lag between the video and audio.

##### Switching Scenes in OBS

It is quite easy to do with these simple steps using OBS Hotkeys!

## Tip #2: Follow the 'Done Video' structure

Your Done Videos should follow the following format:

1. **Intro**
   * Prepare and practice your talking points and visual elements
   * Start with a medium close up shot of yourself
   * Start with a smile the camera for 2 seconds before speaking
   * Briefly introduce yourself. E.g. "I'm David, Solution Architect at SSW"
2. **Post-intro**
   * Transition into a screen share with the solution you've created on screen, moving your portrait shot to the bottom right corner of the screen
   * Provide an overview of the PBI you are going to discuss, remembering to zoom out before showing code samples or demos (see rule - [Do you zoom out then in](/zooming-in-and-out/))
   * The tabs you are planning to use should be already open
3. **Show the pain**
   * Explain the problem you or the stakeholder was having before you finished your work
   * Show a example of where this issue occurred
4. **Demo the solution**
   * Provide a working example of your code
   * Demo the code with a realistic use case
   * Direct attention and give people an idea of where to look
   * Harken back to the pain showing the value of your solution
5. **Outro**
   * Transition back into a medium close up shot of yourself
   * Provide a brief summary of what you discussed in the video
   * Use a signature to bid farewell to the audience. E.g. "This is David signing off"
   * Hold eye contact and a smile to the camera for 2 seconds before the video ends

## Tip #3: Look sharp when presenting

If your company has branded clothing, make sure it's ironed, tidy and visible. Wear it proudly! Alternatively, wear clean, neutral color clothing. E.g. White, grey, or black shirt

## Tip #4: Frame yourself properly

Have your webcam height at eye level for engagement. Make sure there is sufficient headroom - not too little (don't cut off the top of your head in the frame) and no too much (the subject needs to fill the frame).

Ensure your branded clothing is visible and the background is clean and tidy, also consider tilting the camera for a more dynamic background with depth instead of a flat background

## Tip #5: Get your lighting right

Ensure there is optimal room lighting and facial brightness. Consider a ceiling-pointing lamp for additional light. Avoid intense backlights to prevent silhouetting

## Tip #6: Record in one take

Record it in one take, but start again if it's super bad. If something out-of-your control happens, try to be natural! If you mistype a word or click the wrong button, don't freak out and start again, incorporate it. E.g. "Whoops, clicked build accidently. Let me just refresh and go again"

::: info
If your video is short (1-2 mins), then starting again may be optimal. However, if your video is longer ( more than 5 minutes), then try to incorporate any accidental errors and keep going.
:::

## Tip #7: Keep the UI clean

When using a browser, IDE, or any relevant app, make sure the interface is readable, clean and free of distractions.

* **Resolution** - Set your screen to 1080p (1920x1080)
* **Browser** - Hide the bookmarks bar, set the zoom to 125%. (You can easily get a clean browser by using a guest or incognito profile)
* **Environment** - Ensure your app is in a production environment (URL should be <https://northwind365.com> and not <http://localhost:3000>)
* **Microsoft Office** - Hide ribbons
* **Outlook and others** - Clear any irrelevant reminders, clear messages and notifications
* **Everywhere** - [Don't share sensitive information](/hide-sensitive-information)

::: info
**Extra tip:** Make your **mouse cursor larger and more visible** by increasing its size and adding a bright color.

This helps viewers follow your actions easily — especially on high-resolution screens or busy UIs.

* **On Mac:** [Make the pointer easier to see on Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-jo/guide/mac-help/mchlp2920/mac)
* **On Windows:** [Make Windows easier to see | Know where you're pointing](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/make-windows-easier-to-see-c97c2b0d-cadb-93f0-5fd1-59ccfe19345d#id0ebf)

## Tip #8: Use clear audio  

Check your audio devices for the best quality and make sure your audio is clear and not distracting. E.g. Position the microphone close to your mouth.

## Tip #9: Be friendly and natural  

Smile, speak naturally, and imagine you're talking to a friend — it helps build connection and keeps viewers engaged.

## Tip #10: Do a quick test first

After all this effort to capture a great video this can catch any last-minute changes and cut down on potential re-recordings. E.g. Test your intro hook and screen transitions.

## Tip #11: Watch examples  

Remember to watch some "Done" videos to get an idea of what a good 'Done Video' looks like!
