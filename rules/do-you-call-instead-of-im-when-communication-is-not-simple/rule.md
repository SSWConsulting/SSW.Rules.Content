<span class='intro'> <p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">When you realize the communication is not simple and there it is going to take much back and forth IMs, say &quot;Can I call?&quot; and continue the conversation through voice.&#160;</p><div><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​​​​Communication using voice is much faster than typing a message and it can clear misunderstandings. Encourage people to switch to voice if possible.<br></p></div> </span>

<p>Example&#58;</p><p class="greyBox">​<b>- Adam Cogan&#58;</b>&#160;Did you say to me, you would contact Tiago on Skype to do it collaboratively... rather than email?<br><b>- Danijel Malik&#58;</b>&#160;I agreed I'll contact them over Skype as suggested by Drew<br><b>- Adam Cogan&#58;</b>&#160;Isn't that what I just said? (and you said you were sending emails)<br><b>- Danijel Malik&#58;</b>&#160;Hold on...I don't understand you anymore,&#160;<span class="ssw15-rteStyle-Highlight">can we switch to voice?​</span></p><p>​​​Then follow&#160;<a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=f98fc6fe-0e5d-43fe-b560-0f5603ec7069">Do you send &quot;As Per Our Conversation&quot; emails?​</a></p>
