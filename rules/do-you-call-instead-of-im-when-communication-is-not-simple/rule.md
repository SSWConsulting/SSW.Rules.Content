When you realize the communication is not simple and there it is going to take much back and forth IMs, say "Can I call?" and continue the conversation through voice.

Communication using voice is much faster than typing a message and it can clear misunderstandings. Encourage people to switch to voice if possible.

Example:


::: greybox
 **- Adam Cogan:**  Did you say to me, you would contact Tiago on Skype to do it collaboratively... rather than email?
 **- Danijel Malik:**  I agreed I'll contact them over Skype as suggested by Drew
 **- Adam Cogan:**  Isn't that what I just said? (and you said you were sending emails)
 **- Danijel Malik:**  Hold on...I don't understand you anymore, <mark>can we switch to voice?</mark>

Then follow [Do you send "As Per Our Conversation" emails?](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=f98fc6fe-0e5d-43fe-b560-0f5603ec7069)
