When developing Angular or React, there are lots of choices for code editors. The best experience by far is to use [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

Many experienced teams are using Visual Studio for their C# backend and loving using Visual Studio Code for their Angular or React projects.

The recommended extension for Visual Studio Code is ` **Angular Essentials** ` from John Papa

**Angular Essentials** is actually a meta-package that includes a list of great extensions for Angular Development – and this list may be updated in the future as more extensions become popular.

See     https://github.com/johnpapa/vscode-angular-essentials.

You can find more extensions at [Visual Studio | Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/).
