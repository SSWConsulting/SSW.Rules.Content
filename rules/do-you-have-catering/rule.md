If you are providing food and drinks for the attendees, this needs to be booked in and confirmed.

<!--endintro-->

Use the following checklist to ensure you get catering right.

* Dietary requirements – Are there any specific requirements, such as vegetarian, gluten free, kosher, halal etc.?
* Is there adequate access to get the food and catering staff into the venue?
* Is there a designated area where food is served?
* Is the venue allowed to provide food for attendees?


 **TIP:** You can make your event look a million dollars by taking a little extra time and decanting your yummy offerings into nicer containers.
