A big suite of various levels of automated tests can be a great way of making sure that problems introduced into the codebase are identified quickly.

As the number of automated tests increases over time, it becomes more likely that some of them will fail and it's important to handle these failures appropriately.

Focus on “green builds”, tolerating failures leads to erosion of trust in the tests to the point where they can become pointless to run

note on skipping tests as a policy too
