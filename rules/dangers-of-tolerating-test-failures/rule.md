A big suite of various levels of automated tests can be a great way of quickly identifying problems introduced into the codebase.

As your application changes and the number of automated tests increases over time, though, it becomes more likely that some of them will fail. 

It's important to know how to handle these failures appropriately.

### Some anti-patterns in handling automated test failures

#### Tolerate the failures

failures are really problems?

anti-patterns:
just a few tests
always the same ones fail, so we "know" it's really OK, etc.

#### "Skip" the failing tests "for now"

bad idea, you'll never go back

### Better ways to handle automated test failures

Good: fix or delete
instead
Focus on "green builds", tolerating failures leads to erosion of trust in the tests to the point where they can become pointless to run

Reminder that youâ€™re writing (test) code because you have doubts about other (product) code
Product problem, fix it
If it's important enough for a test, then fix it. If there's no value in the test anymore, delete it
