This keeps coupling low, and therefore maintainability high</span>  </span>

<p>The classes in each layer can depend on layers toward the centre.</p><p>It emphasizes the use of interfaces for the business logic and repository layers. The repository layer corresponds to the Data Access layer in an n-Tier architecture.</p><p>An n-Tier architecture has at its base the database.<br>The core of the onion architecture is the Domain Model, and all dependencies are injected. This leads to more ​maintainable applications since it emphasizes separation of concerns.</p>
