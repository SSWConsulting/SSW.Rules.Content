In team chats, a 👍 (thumbs up) is often used to acknowledge a message or indicate that a task is done. However, this can lead to ambiguity, especially when the task isn’t completed immediately.

To improve clarity and keep everyone aligned:

* React with 👀 when you've seen the message and plan to action it later
* Once the task is complete, update your reaction to ✅ to signal it’s done

This simple habit reduces confusion, keeps chats clean, and ensures the whole team can track progress at a glance.
