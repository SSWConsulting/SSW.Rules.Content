LinkedIn Talent Solutions and  **[LinkedIn Talent Hub](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/talent-hub)** - a new Application Tracking System (ATS) that lets you source, manage, and hire – all in one place. 

Talent Hub gives hiring teams complete visibility into every stage of the hiring process and how candidates have engaged with your company - from candidate pipeline, interviews, feedback to extended offers. It also uses the actions, skills, and experience of the half a billion LinkedIn members to deliver insights about your candidates, the talent pool, and the market at every stage of the hiring process. This means you can get timely insights throughout your hiring process to help you make better talent decisions and gain an edge over the competition.
