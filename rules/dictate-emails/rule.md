Everyone knows that you can use Google Assistant or Siri to talk to your phone, but not everyone knows that you can also use dictate in Microsoft Word, PowerPoint and Outlook.

You can choose whether you want automatic punctuation or not, and it's quite good at figuring out what the correct punctuation should be, most of the time.

Key commands that you will likely need include:

* New/next paragraph
* Backspace
* Delete/scrap/undo (removes last word)
* Delete/scrap/undo that (removes last sentence)
* Delete/scrap/undo the last x characters/words/lines/sentences
* Start list
* Start numbered list
* New/next line
* Exit list
* Bold/italicise/underline <word or phrase you want formatted>
* Exit dictation
