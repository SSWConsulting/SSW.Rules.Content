It’s easy when looking at availability reports and skill matrices to dehumanise the developers you’re assigning to work. Make sure to always keep the human touch by doing the following:

<!--endintro-->

1. Always call the dev before assigning them to a new client
2. Make sure they’re happy with the technology
3. Make sure they’re happy with the time commitment (e.g. X days a week for Y weeks)
4. Find out if they need a handover
5. Although generally client work always comes 1st, there may sometimes be internal bookings that might need to take precedence.
