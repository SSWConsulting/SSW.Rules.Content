Everyone who will be involved in Scrum (pigs and chickens alike) should have read and understood the Scrum guide. 

<!--endintro-->



Understanding the concepts of Scrum is easy; implementing it is hard!

![](ScrumChickenPig.jpg)**Figure: It's handy to know who the pigs and chickens are. The word "commit" and this silly chicken and pig story, were removed from the Scrum Guide 2011.** 


Everyone should:

1. Read the 
      [Scrum Guide](http://www.scrumguides.org/).
2. Take the 
      [Scrum Open assessment](http://www.scrum.org/scrumopen/) and get at least 75% to be “Certified Scrum 1”
3. Watch the awesome video '[Scrum in 10 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU0llRltyFM)'
