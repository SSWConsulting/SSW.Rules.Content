MDM doesnâ€™t do a hard delete, so if you try to delete a 2GB file, the space will still be being used up, sitting on your precious (and limited) online storage space.

<!--endintro-->

Example: you have a large 2GB piece of video marketing media that you accidentally copy 3 times. Instead of being able to delete it, all you can actually do is deactivate it, so it will still be taking up space.

The solution is to overwrite with a tiny file first, then delete. It will still be sitting on the server, but only taking up the much smaller amount of space.
