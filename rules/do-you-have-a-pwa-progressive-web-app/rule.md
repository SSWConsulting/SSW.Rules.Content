<span class='intro'> Accordingly to&#160;Google, &quot;<b>Progressive Web Apps </b>provide an installable, app-like experience on desktop and mobile that are built and delivered directly via the web. They're web apps that are fast and reliable. And most importantly, they're web apps that work in any browser. If you're building a web app today, you're already on the path towards building a Progressive Web App.&quot;<br> </span>

<p>​In order&#160;to be a PWA, your app should&#58;<br></p><ul><li><b>Use a responsive design</b>, so it works on desktop or mobile.</li><li><b>Be fast</b>, using a service worker to precache the app resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) needed to run, and cache the weather data at runtime to improve performance.<br></li><li><b>Be installable</b>, using a web app manifest and the&#160;beforeinstallprompt&#160;event to notify the user it's installable.​</li></ul>You can check the Progressive Web App score of your application using Chrome's Developer tools&#58;<br>
