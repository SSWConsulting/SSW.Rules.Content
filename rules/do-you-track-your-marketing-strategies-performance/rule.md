<span class='intro'> <p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Given most companies sink a lot of money into marketing, it’s important to know if your strategy as outlined in your Marketing Plan is working for you.​<br></p> </span>

<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​Firstly, you need to set realistic performance standards.&#160;What metrics are you going to use to measure your performance?&#160;You&#160;need to have these clearly documented in your marketing plan&#160;so that it is clear to the whole team how it will be measured and analyzed.&#160;This will&#160;dictate the way&#160;a&#160;campaign&#160;is&#160;created, its budget, and metrics.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">One simple way of tracking this, is to&#160;collate the performance data&#160;and analyze&#160;the&#160;results.&#160;For example, a goal might be to increase the engagement on your social media pages by 6% in 6 months, to ensure you’re on track you would need to see your audience growing by 1% every month.&#160;&#160;</p><p>To do this,&#160;you first need to&#160;decide&#160;how&#160;frequently you’d like to&#160;collect your data.&#160;Monthly is a good cadence to start with, as it can show trends without being too labor-intensive.&#160;However, some metrics might need to be looked at more&#160;frequently&#160;to&#160;ensure you’re on track.&#160;</p><p>Here is a diagram outlining some of the ways you can track your performance&#58;</p><dl class="image"><dt><img src="mkt-performance-diagram.png" alt="mkt-performance-diagram.png" style="width&#58;750px;" /></dt></dl>
<p>A simple way of tracking this, is&#160;to have a spreadsheet that&#160;holds&#160;all of&#160;your data.&#160;Measurement can be as simple or as complicated as you make it. Don’t measure simply for the sake of having some numbers to present to your upper management. If you aren’t certain what you should be measuring, ask yourself these two questions&#58;&#160;</p><ul><li>Do these metrics support my key goals?&#160;</li><li>Can I&#160;take action&#160;on these metrics (i.e., will they provide me insight into how I can improve my program)?&#160;</li></ul>Unless you can answer “yes” to the questions above, you likely don’t need to be collecting the data — at least at first. &#160;
