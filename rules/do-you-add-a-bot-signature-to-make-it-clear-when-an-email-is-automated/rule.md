<span class='intro'> <p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​With the advent of Microsoft Flow and Logic Apps, automated emails are becoming more common. And in fact any reminder or notification email you find yourself sending regularly should probably be automated.&#160;</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">However, the end user should be able to tell that this was sent by a bot, and not a real person, both for transparency, and also to potentially trigger them to automate some of their own workflow.​</p> </span>
