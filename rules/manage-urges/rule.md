Emails or conversations can sometimes trigger negative emotional reactions leading to regrets. Managing your urges helps you overcome bad habits, avoid emotional outbursts, and make better decisions.

<!--endintro-->

You can manage your urges by using a technique called 'Pause and Plan.' When you're in a heightened emotional state, your brain enters 'fight or flight' mode, making impulsive reactions more likely. Instead of reacting immediately, set a timer for 30 minutes. After this pause, you'll be in a better position to decide if you still want to proceed.

Instead of reacting immediately, set a timer for 30 min. After this time, you can decide if you still want to proceed.

This technique can help you

* Avoid saying things you don't mean
* Make better decisions
* Overcome bad habits
* Manage your emotions

Thanks for letting me know, I've taken some time to check the Acceptance Criteria and you're right - I must have misread it.
This is quick to fix, so I'll do it now and send you a screenshot.
