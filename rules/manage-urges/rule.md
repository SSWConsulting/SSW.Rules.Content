Sometimes an emails or conversations can give you the urge to react poorly. Your poor reaction can mean you say or do something you regret. It's important to manage your urges to get over bad habits, avoid poor emotional reactions, and make better decisions.

<!--endintro-->

You can manage your urges by using a techinque called the 'Pause and Plan' response. This technique is based on the idea that when you are in a heightened emotional state, your brain is in 'fight or flight' mode. This means that you are more likely to react impulsively and say things you don't mean.

Instead of reacting immediately, set a timer for 30 min. After this time, you can decide if you still want to proceed.

This technique can help you
- Avoid saying things you don't mean
- Make better decisions
- Overcome bad habits
- Manage your emotions

The nav menu is on the wrong side of the page. It should be on the left, not the right.

Hey Bob,

Thanks for letting me know, I've taken some time to check the Acceptance Criteria and you're right - I must have misread it.   
This is quick to fix, so I'll do it now and send you a screenshot.
