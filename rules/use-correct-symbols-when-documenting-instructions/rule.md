An important area which Microsoft does not apply strict standards to, is documenting instructions. This is often a confusing dilemma for many people, as the way in which instructions are worded and arranged is very important in helping the user understand the instructions. Therefore, the instructions should be minimalistic, clear and concise.

In Ken Getz's words, you MUST ALWAYS list the items in the order the user selects them. I often see on Microsoft documentation: 'Select All Programs from the Start menu'. That's inexcusable!
