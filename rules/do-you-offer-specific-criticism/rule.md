Every day you will probably come across something that could be improved. If you're not making improvements, you're going backwards. But don't make suggestions or criticisms without being specific.

<!--endintro-->


::: greybox
"Do you know our sales process is pretty bad, what are you going to do about it?"

::: bad
Figure: Bad Example - Nonspecific criticism 

:::

When you find a problem, pinpoint it directly (and recommend a solution):


::: greybox
"The current sales process is pretty bad. It does not ensure that a prospect is followed up by a phone call within 7 days of an initial meeting. Please create a workflow in CRM, have it tested by the sales manager, and then we will email the sales team to inform them about the improvement."

::: good
Figure: Good Example - Offering criticism in this way ensures that something will happen to fix the problem

:::


::: greybox
"Not done, please try again"

:::


::: bad
Figure: Bad Example - If they don't immediately know what to fix, this might end up in their "too hard" bucket and never get done"

:::


::: greybox
"Not done, you missed the second requirement"  
:::


::: good
The specific missed requirement lets them quickly fix the mistake

:::

Of course, there are times that you can 'feel' that a problem exists, but you may not even be sure how are unable to pinpoint it or can't think of a good solution. In this instance you should speak to someone who you think may be able to identify a solution, come to an agreement, and then request that action be taken.

When criticism is generic, it is impossible to know what to fix.
