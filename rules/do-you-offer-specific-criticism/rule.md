<p>
                    Every day you will probably&#160;come across something that could be improved. If you're
                    not making improvements, you're going backwards. But&#160;don't make suggestions or
                    criticisms without being specific.

                        Bad Example - Non specific criticism</dd></dl>
                <p>
                    When you find a problem, pinpoint it directly (and recommend a solution)&#58;
                </p>
                <dl class="good">
                    <dt>&quot;The current sales process does not ensure that a prospect is followed up by a phone
                        call within 7 days of an initial meeting. Please create a workflow in CRM4, have it tested by the sales manager, and then we will email the sales team to inform them about the improvement.&quot; </dt>
                    <dd>
                        Figure&#58; Good Example - Offering criticism in this way ensures that something will
                        happen to fix the problem.

                    Of course there are times that you can 'feel' that a problem exists, but you may not even be sure how are unable to pinpoint it, or can't think of a good solution. In this instance you should speak
                    to someone who you think may be able to identify a solution, come to an agreement,
                    and then request that action be taken.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When criticism is general, it is impossible to know what to fix.​​</p>
