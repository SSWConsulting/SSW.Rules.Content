**Replace this with a specific rule on the test pyramid?**

Just as there are [different types of testing](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/different-types-of-testing), there are also different levels of testing.

Having an awareness of the different types and levels of testing is critical to developing appropriate test strategies for your applications.

types to mitigate different types of risk, levels similarly?

Why different levels matter and whatâ€™s appropriate at each level. Use different models for this: pyramids, bug filter idea (Sussman), etc. Pyramid is currently in previous rule.

**Add your rule to a category**
