<span class='intro'> ​​​Complex documentation can waste time. Many user requirements can be best encapsulated in screen mock-ups. Spend more time on mockups compared with time on documentation.​<br><br> </span>

<p>Storyboarding is a technique taken from movie production.&#160;</p><dl class="image"><dt> <img src="movie-storyboard.jpg" alt="Movie Storyboard" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Movies are expensive to produce, so directors do storyboards first and then the product designer, costume designer, lighting people etc. all know what they need to do for each scene<br>Source&#58;&#160;<a href="http&#58;//www.thewoodsmanfilm.com/importance-storyboarding-filmmaking/">Woodsman Film Company </a><br></dd></dl><p>There are five primary types of mockups&#58;</p><ol><li> 
      <b>Hand drawn Mockups</b></li><li> 
      <b>Wireframe Mockups</b></li><li> 
      <b>Developer HTML Mockups</b></li><li> 
      <b>Designer HTML + CSS Mockup</b></li><li> 
      <b>Designer Photoshop Mockups&#160;</b>(recommended)<br></li></ol><p>Often it's best to start with some hand-drawn ones to get started. Then&#160;if you have access to designers,&#160;complete a couple of full 'Designer Photoshop Mockups' for &quot;look and feel&quot; approval,&#160;then complete the balance as wireframes.</p><h3>Hand drawn Mockup</h3><p>'Hand drawn Mockups' are recommended to be done with the customer. Since it doesn't deal with any styling/color issues, 'Photoshop Mockups' will be needed after.</p><dl class="image"><dt> <img src="Hand-Drawn-Mockup.jpg" alt="Hand drawn Mockup" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; A 'Hand drawn mockup' example. Nice and quick for early concept design<br></dd></dl><h3>Wireframe Mockup<br></h3><p>A layout of how the controls will look is usually all that is needed initially, without worrying about images. <a target="_blank" href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/projects/ml_elaw/scenarios/index.html">An example of Wireframe Mockup</a></p><p>
   <strong>Tip&#58;</strong> The tools to develop a wireframe depend on your skillset and the front end technology chosen.

      <strong>Warning&#58;</strong> Don't go down the track of giving a customer a few concepts (on some projects we gave 2 or 3 completely different concepts by different designers). There becomes too much mixing and matching when they see them. Once the images are approved, then the designers slice them up and turn them into HTML (slicing is the exporting of each image).</p></div><dl class="image"><dt> <img src="1d6c03_PSMockup.jpg" alt="Designer Photoshop Mockup" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Designer Photoshop Mockup example - recommended as quick to change, when changes happen </dd></dl><p>

UML and other formal documentation methods can be useful for developers.</p><p>The overarching problem is it gets out of date, so it gathers dust (aka Technical Debt).<br>A better way of getting documentation is to flesh out the classes and use the VS Dependency Graph or NDepend.<br>A demo can be seen in the 2nd video <a href="http&#58;//channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/Australia/2012?sort=sequential&amp;direction=desc&amp;term=&amp;s=adam%2Bcogan">&quot;A Modern Architecture Review&quot;</a>.</p><dl class="image"><dt> <img src="23f19c_ndepend.png" alt="" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Tools like NDepend can generate diagrams from your source code so there's no &quot;Technical Debt&quot; </dd></dl><h2>Summary</h2><p>Mock-ups and wireframes are far easier to understand.</p><p>For example, to communicate that “a customer has many phone numbers”, a storyboard/wireframe of how that relationship will appear in the user interface is highly more likely to be understood by the client.</p><p>The clear communication of the message&#160;is more important than the medium used to convey that message.</p><div class="ms-rteCustom-GreyBox"><p>Here are some more hot tips on mock-ups&#58;</p><ul><li>Avoid the thought of a &quot;throw-away&quot; prototype. An example of a throwaway prototype is when you design screens in Access, but the application will be HTML. So design the screens you and the customer are happy with the technology you will be using, and then use them in the app.</li><li>It is best to have a designer and developer and customer working together.</li><li>Get the mock-ups <a shape="rect" href="/Pages/AskClientsToInitialYourWork.aspx">physically initialed</a>, especially if you are performing a fixed-price contract. Yes, paperless is great - but not in this case.</li><li>If you can't get mock-ups initialed, then page by page approval over email is the 2nd best option.</li><li>A tip I picked up from Tom Howe was to&#160;always add a client's branding into the mockup - it makes a big impression</li><li>Mock-ups should follow <a shape="rect" href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterInterfaces.aspx">standard interface rules</a> </li><li>Write the related business rules at the bottom of each screen - and turn into unit tests.<br></li></ul></div><h3>Related Rules</h3><ul><li>
