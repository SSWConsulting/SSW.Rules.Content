   </dt><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Figure&#58; Good&#160;​​Example - You use&#160;Advanced Find | Export to&#160;Excel, but you’ll always have to re-create your reports each time you need the information. This is fine if you only need the information for a one off purpose like a quick mail out​​</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt>

   </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Better&#160;Example - The&#160;better way to do it is through CRM 2013&#160;​reports (built in SQL Reporting Services), as this gives you a reusable report you can come back to every time you need it​</dd></dl>
