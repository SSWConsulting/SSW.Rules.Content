If you wish to organize a meeting that involves some of your colleagues and a client, instead of sending an email, send an appointment. Sending appointments is convenient because all the user has to do is click 'accept' and it is in their calendar.

      <img class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" alt="Outlook Appointment" src="OutlookAppointment.gif">
   &lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: Use Outlook appointments to easily synchronise your calendar with your client's</dd></dl>
This way Outlook will remind your colleagues about the appointment and you can update them if any changes are made.

If the appointment is for      **3 days or less** , send a separate appointment for each day. This is because multiple-day appointments appear at the top in your Outlook Calendar, so you risk missing the appointment (see below).
