In speaker lounges and team calls alike, people often appreciate a professional-looking video setup. But it doesn't take a fancy camera or expensive gear to achieve that.

Use your phone as your webcam. With modern devices, it’s easy to connect your phone to your laptop and benefit from better video quality, including portrait mode and studio lighting effects - no complicated configuration needed.

When travelling, a simple setup can look and sound great:

* A tablet can double as a second monitor
* A small tripod helps position the camera at head height
* For casual video calls, the built-in laptop mic is fine
* For recordings or interviews, a compact wireless mic (e.g. DJI Mic Mini) can dramatically improve sound quality

Using gear you already have, and making small improvements to framing and audio, can help you look and sound professional—whether you're presenting at a conference or joining a daily stand-up.
