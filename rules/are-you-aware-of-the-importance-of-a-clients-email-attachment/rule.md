Sometimes clients will add attachment files into emails. Those files could be documents or images, which may contain details or solutions of the issue, or some helpful information.<br>
To keep the history, it is very important to embed the attachment files into the email since it's easy to lose those files when responding.

  ​​<img src="EmailAttachImage_1_small.jpg" alt="The image is in attachment. " class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" /><p>
<font size="+0" class="ms-rteCustom-FigureBad">Figure: Bad Example - The image is in attachment. </font><br>
<img src="EmailAttachImage_2.JPG" alt="The image is included in the context" class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" /><br>
<font size="+0" class="ms-rteCustom-FigureGood">Figure: Good Example - The image is included in the context.</font><br>
PS: Clients make attachments because they are using OWA and you can't paste an image in - see suggestion for OWA </p>
