​​During the Sprint Review Meeting you should demo all features (Sprint goals expressed in PBIs) that you have been working on during the Sprint. Make sure to prepare a demo script, which you can follow easily, because you might be nervous.&#160;<div><br>
The demo script helps if you are going back and want to know what has been done during each Sprint and is nice for documentation purposes as well. 
</div>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
The demo script should include 3 parts&#58;<br>
<ol>
    <li>Committed PBIs&#160;<br></li>
    <li>Steps to show what has been done aka Demo script itself​ </li>
    <li>Give an overview of upcoming PBIs, so that everyone has an idea before you go into the Sprint Planning Meeting </li>
</ol>
