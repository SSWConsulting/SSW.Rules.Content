Sharing a file is easy when looking at a file. However the email people get from it will have a notification-looking, which may result in it being overlooked/ignored.

Because of that, you should avoid using that funcionality if you want people to notice and read your email. A normal email with the link and instructions should be sent instead.

**Note:** It is a good idea to review SharePoint and Teams stats and tell users **not** to use this funcionality by pointing them to this rule.
