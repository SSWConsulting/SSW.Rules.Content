Group calls are made for important discussions to be had, and distractions can derail them. Ever been in a group call where someone just vanishes? It's confusing and can mess up the flow of conversation. Here are the best ways to minimize distractions:

<!--endintro-->

## Message 'BRB' and 'I'm Back'

If you have to get up for a minute, message in the chat you'll be right back and then when you've returned.

- **Doesn't interrupt**: The conversation doesn't need to pause
- **Keeps Things Moving**: No one has to stop and wonder where you went.

Interrupting the flow of conversation to tell everyone you have to go the bathroom

::: ok
Figure: OK Example - It's nicer but still stops the chat for a bit.

Messaging in the group chat "brb in x mins" and then "Iâ€™m back" when you return

Figure: Good Example - Do this so one is left guessing and the call can continue smoothly.

## Mute if someone comes to talk to you

Another way to keep the group call smooth is to mute your mic if someone comes to talk to you in person. This avoids distracting background noise.

- **Be mindful** of people talking or other noises that might be registering into your microphone
- **It's okay** to turn away for a minute, as long as you mute to keep the call free from random noise!
