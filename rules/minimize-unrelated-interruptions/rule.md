Group calls are made for important discussions to be had, and distractions can derail them. Ever been in a group call where someone just vanishes? It's confusing and can mess up the flow of conversation.

<!--endintro-->

## Taking a short break

If you have to take a break, **avoid interruptinons** and **keep things moving** by simply messaging 'BRB' and 'I'm Back' in the chat.

Leaving the group call without letting anyone know.

::: bad
Figure: Bad example - Makes everyone pause and ask where you went
:::

::: greybox
Interrupting the flow of conversation to verbally tell everyone you have to leave.
:::
::: ok
Figure: OK example - It's good to communicate, but still stops the chat for a bit
:::

::: greybox
Messaging in the group chat _"brb in X mins"_ ...
and then _"I’m back"_ when you return.
:::
::: good
Figure: Good example - The call can continue smoothly and the team will know when you're back
:::

## Leaving the call

If you need to leave the conversation, simply message that you have to go with the reason and without interrupting. Aim to give a few minutes notice.

::: greybox
Messaging in the group chat _"Sorry, I have to go guys - Dinner time"_ and leave straight away
:::
::: ok
Figure: OK example - The call can continue smoothly and no one will be guessing where you went
:::

::: greybox
Messaging in the group chat _"Dinner time - Will have to go in 5 minutes"_
:::
::: good
Figure: Good example - The call can continue smoothly and people still have a chance to talk to you if they need
:::

This way the conversation doesn't need to pause if you are taking a break; and no one has to stop and wonder where you went.
