<p>​
                    If your styles are going to be different, then make it obvious that they are different. Don't be timid about it! This is a great time to be daring!</p><p>"Different" can mean many things: different font family, different style, different size, and​ different color. But the most important thing is to make it obvious that they are different.</p><p>Partial differences make people get confused and start asking things like "this looks a bit strange, but I don't know why. Is that intentional?"</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>Compare the follow two examples:</p><dl class="badImage"><dt>
                        <img src="choosingFontsbad.png" alt="" /></dt><dd>
                        Figure: Bad Example - The heading and body text is very simlar, only 2px font-size difference.</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt>
                        <img src="choosingFontsgood.png" alt="" /></dt><dd>
                        Figure: Good Example - The heading as been bolded and the content font size decreased to make it more obvious that the two are different styles.</dd></dl><p>Picking your fonts carefully applies to all forms of design where text is involved. Unfortunately, deciding what sort of differences look good and what doesn't is extremely subjective and is a skill that gets developed overtime.</p>
