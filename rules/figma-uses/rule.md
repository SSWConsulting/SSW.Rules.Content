**Video: What is Figma? (5 min)**

It's widely used in the design industry for its simplicity, efficiency, and collaborative features. Figma is accessible through a web browser or desktop application, making it easy to work from anywhere.

Top 5 uses of Figma in a development project:

1. **User Interface (UI) Design:** Figma is primarily used for creating UI designs. Its intuitive interface allows designers to craft pixel-perfect layouts, design elements, and visual components for websites, web applications, mobile apps, and other digital products.
