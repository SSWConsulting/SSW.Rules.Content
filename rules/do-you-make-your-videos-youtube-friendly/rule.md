<span class='intro'> <p>Your videos must be optimized for YouTube including in regards to the watch time (total time spent watching a YouTube video since it went live) as their algorithm pushes to increase watch time. YouTube will rank higher in a video with a higher watch time (this is not the only setting).</p> </span>

<p>Your videos will be more adapted to YouTube by following the below rules&#58;<br>&#160;<br>a.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Videos must be long (longer videos tend to outrank short videos despite what “experts” tend to say). Short videos work well on Facebook and LinkedIn, not on YouTube. A longer video will accumulate a lot of total watch time automatically. On average, videos on the first results page are around 15 minute-long. Consider making your videos 8-15min long.<br>&#160;<br>b.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Cut off the fluff from your intros. According to YouTube’s official blog, <a href="https&#58;//youtube.googleblog.com/2011/08/youtube-creator-playbook-tips-first-15.html">the first 15 seconds of a video is key</a>. You, therefore, have to grab viewer’s attention within 15 seconds. The intro must quickly preview exactly what the video will cover (you can start by saying “Hi guys, today I will tell you how to cook a delicious chocolate cake” before moving on).<br>&#160;<br>c.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Use “pattern interrupts”. They are elements in a video that are different from the rest of the video (they literally “interrupt” the “pattern”). These can be graphics, other video extracts, camera angle changes etc.<br>&#160;<br>d.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Script every line or at least follow a detailed outline. You must look confident while not reading a piece of paper. Feel free to read a piece a paper, say what you just read in front of the camera and then cut the reading part when editing the video. This will also give you the opportunity to insert a pattern interrupt.<br>&#160;<br>e.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Analyse what already worked to see what is already proven to work (you can use Buffer to help you for instance). To do so, watch the top 3 videos when searching for a particular keyword and note what they have in common (using many examples, videos are all long, all videos mention “live video”, “Instagram”, “influencer marketing”, 2 videos out of 3 mentions they are specifically for this year, etc.). Then indeed include these elements in your video.</p>
