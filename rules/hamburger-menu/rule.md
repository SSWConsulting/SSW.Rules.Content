Hamburger menus are everywhere. Those three stacked lines that hide site or app navigation. They became popular for decluttering mobile UIs, but they come at a cost: reduced discoverability, slower navigation, and lower engagement.

## When should you use a hamburger menu?

Use it **only when screen space is tight** (typically on mobile). Otherwise, always prefer showing navigation visibly.

### ❌ Common mistakes to avoid

* **Using a top-right hamburger on desktop** – This breaks user expectations. On desktop, primary navigation belongs on the left or fully visible
* **Combining a hamburger menu with bottom navigation** – Choose one. Using both creates confusion and redundancy
* **Hiding essential links** – Important actions should be visible. Hiding them behind a menu lowers engagement and completion rates

### ✅ Best practices

* Use the **standard 3-line icon** – don't reinvent it
* Include **clear animation or toggle state**
* Make sure it's **easy to reach** on mobile, don’t place in hard-to-tap corners
* If you only have a logo + menu, favor **left placement** for balance and ergonomics
* Test with users to confirm comprehension and usability

Use the hamburger menu only when needed, place it where users expect it, and never use it as an excuse to hide important navigation. Always test your decisions, navigation is too important to guess.
