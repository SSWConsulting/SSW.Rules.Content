Imagine this scenario... Mary notices a small typo on a page in her intranet. As a good employee, she opens up the [backlog](/do-you-constantly-add-to-the-backlog) and reports the spelling error. As she sends it she says to herself *"That took more time to report the error than it would have taken me to fix it"*.

Small errors should be fixed by the person who found them stright away. Text changes can be easily done in SharePoint or WordPress. If you know who the culprit is, it might be a good idea to inform that person, including the things you have fixed.
