Developers should add a version number at the end of the out package. E.g. SSWCodeAuditor\_<mark>v14.0.0</mark>.exe

Here is how you do it in Advanced Installer:

<!--endintro-->

1. In the navigation pane look for 
       **Media**
2. Choose 
       **Configuration** tab and click in 
       **MSI name** text box which is located under 
       **Output** section
3. Next to the text add 
      [|ProductVersion]. If the text-box is empty you may want to start it with 
      [|ProductName]
