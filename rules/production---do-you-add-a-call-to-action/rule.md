<p>Without a call to action prompting viewers to do something at the end of a video, the purpose of the video is lost. As such, make sure you include the call to action at the end.​</p>
Common objectives are to&#58; <ul><li>Get them to the company's Facebook page</li>
<li>Obtain the viewer's email address</li>
<li>Get the viewer to provide info and request a service from the company</li></ul>

<p>A good 'call to action' should&#58;</p>
<ol><li>Be short (around 30 seconds).</li>
<li>Not have too many options. A visitor is much more likely to do a task if he's not confused by being given 24 social media options.</li>
<li>(Optionally) Tell them they get value eg. if they comment they will make a difference.</li>
<li>If you have a paid subscription offering or a free one like YouTube) give incentives to subscribe now, along with the benefits subscribed users get.</li>
<li>Remember that people have different preferences for social media. You pretty much need to cover your bases. Have a Twitter page, Facebook page, Linked-in account, YouTube channel etc. Of course don't have all these in the 'call to action', but make sure that those options are easily accessible.</li>
<li>If you are using YouTube or another service that provides the option to have annotations, use annotations that prompt the viewer to comment or subscribe. A 'subscribe' link&#160;in the annotation&#160;gets more subscribers</li>
