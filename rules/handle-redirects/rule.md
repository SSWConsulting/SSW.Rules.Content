When migrating your old website to a new technology stack, maintaining SEO and avoiding potential 404 errors is crucial. Implementing redirects ensures smooth traffic transition and preserves your SEO rankings.

### Choosing the Right Redirect Method

#### 1. Application Level

Client-Side Redirects: Easy but poor for SEO and maintenance. Migrating pages in the future would make this approach cumbersome.

Server-Side Application: A dedicated web app can handle redirects, but maintenance and scalability become challenging over time.

#### 2. CDN Level (Global)

Edge Level Redirects: Ideal for global distribution and ease of management. Solutions like Azure Front Door or Cloudflare can be effective.
