<p>Some clients think that a Project Manager is just a resource that increases the cost of a project. But a house does not get built if you leave the architect, carpenters, electricians and plumbers to just work it out between themselves. The house *does* get built if the foreman is keeping everyone on their toes, making sure they are doing their job.&#160;&#160;</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<div>It's generally best for the Scrum Master not to be a member of the development team so that can stay objective, but in rare cases, you may need to use a Semi-Scrum Master like this.</div>
<p>If you are using Scrum&#58;</p>
<ul><li>The sprint backlog is approved by the Product Owner (the customer)</li>
<li>The Dev team is working to the sprint backlog (usually 2 weeks)The Scrum Master is ensuring the client is kept up-to-date (via the Review, Retro and Planning meetings) #1</li>
<li>The Scrum Master is ensuring the client is kept up-to-date (via the 4 reports) </li>
<li>The Account Manager is booking in future sprints (after the Planning Meeting)</li>
<li>The Account Manager invoices (usually every week).</li></ul>
<p>If you are using the old waterfall method&#58;</p>
<ul><li>The specification is approved by the customer</li>
<li>The Dev team is working to the specifications (for anywhere from 2 months to 2 years)</li>
<li>The Project Manager is ensuring the client is kept up-to-date (via ad hoc meetings)</li>
<li>The Account Manager sends invoices when milestones are met.<br></li></ul>
