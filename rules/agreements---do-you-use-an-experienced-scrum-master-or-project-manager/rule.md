Some clients think that a Project Manager is just a resource that increases the cost of a project. But a house does not get built if you leave the architect, carpenters, electricians and plumbers to just work it out between themselves. The house \*does\* get built if the foreman is keeping everyone on their toes, making sure they are doing their job.

Software teams often come with a Project Manager. You can do better than that by getting a Scrum Master.

<!--endintro-->

It's generally best for the Scrum Master \*not\* to be a member of the development team. This way they can stay objective and it creates more of a ceremony when they turn up.

**Tip:** If they are trying to be a member of the development team and a Scrum Master, call them a 'Semi Scrum Master" as they often don't do as good a job.

Here is a common way a project goes with a Scrum Master involved:

* The sprint backlog is approved by the Product Owner (the customer)
* The Development team works on the sprint backlog (usually 2 weeks)... The Scrum Master is ensuring the client is kept up-to-date (via the Review, Retro and Planning meetings) #1
* The Scrum Master is ensuring the client is kept up-to-date (via the 4 reports)
* The Account Manager is booking in future sprints (after the Planning Meeting)
* The Account Manager invoices (usually every week).


This is much better than the old waterfall method which goes like this:

* The specification is approved by the customer
* The Development team is working to the specifications for some months (but can be from anywhere from 2 months to 2 years)
* The Project Manager is ensuring the client is kept up-to-date (via ad hoc meetings)
* The Account Manager sends invoices when milestones are met.


Insist that your Scrum Master (aka Project Manager) [maintains a strict project schedule](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=ba60e584-b904-4028-a5be-e2b8900b4c97).

**#1 For Scrum Projects:**

In Scrum projects the role of project manager is split into three roles: Scrum Master, Product Owner and Team. Each role is essential.
