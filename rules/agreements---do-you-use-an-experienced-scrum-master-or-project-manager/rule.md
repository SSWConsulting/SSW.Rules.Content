<p>Some clients think that a Project Manager is just a resource that increases the cost of a project. But a house does not get built if you leave the architect, carpenters, electricians and plumbers to just work it out between themselves. The house *does* get built if the foreman is keeping everyone on their toes, making sure they are doing their job.&#160;&#160; <br></p><div class="ms-rtestate-read ms-rte-embedcode ms-rte-embedil ms-rtestate-notify"><iframe width="853" height="480" src="https&#58;//www.youtube.com/embed/QbPkcfzi2HI" frameborder="0"></iframe>&#160;</div><p>Software teams often come with a Project Manager.

<p>It's generally best for the Scrum Master *not* to be a member of the development team.
