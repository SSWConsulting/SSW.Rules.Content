Make sure that you cover as much of the agenda as possible within the timebox, ad keep other topics to a minimum.

When you identify topics that do need to be hashed out, but that don’t need to be covered in this meeting, keep track of them in a “parking lot”.

This could be a quick message or email to the people involved, and could be sent by the meeting facilitator, or one of those people. In a tech free meeting, just keep a notepad with the topics and people involved.
