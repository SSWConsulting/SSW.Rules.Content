At SSW, our proposals are to be divided into 3 parts:<br><ul><li>The white section: This is the document information.</li><li>The yellow section: The actual proposal, where all the information for the client can be found</li><li>The red section: This is the SSW section and contains a brief presentation of our company and appendices. Please note that this section is not as relevant to client and therefore comes last<br></li></ul>
