When SysAdmins first get going with Hyper-V, they often choose to use dynamically expanding VHDâ€™s. They often do this to increase VHD creation time and reduce hard disk usage.

The problem with dynamically expanding VHDs is that they reduce the performance of the Virtual Machine. It is much better to use a fixed VHD when the Virtual Machine is used in a production environment.
