Payroll tax is a common wage related expense that many businesses will have to account for in their month-to-month operations. 
The rules around when you begin paying for payroll tax or the amount is dependent on your State Government's rules.

The Australian Government has general information about payroll tax, including affected businesses and possible exemptions however, specific information relevant to your business 
will be drilled down further on the State Government's websites. For a general understanding of payroll tax, see the Australian Government's main website as follow:
* [Australian Business Government - Payroll Tax](https://business.gov.au/finance/taxation/payroll-tax)

It is important to stay up to date with the State Government's rules as it may change from time to time. The relevant State Government websites for NSW, QLD and VIC are as follows:
* [NSW OSR - Payroll Tax](https://www.revenue.nsw.gov.au/help-centre/online-services/sections/payroll-tax)
* [QLD OSR - Payroll Tax](https://www.business.qld.gov.au/running-business/employing/payroll-tax)
* [VIC OSR - Payroll Tax](https://www.sro.vic.gov.au/payroll-tax)

### Tip:

> A common error businesses make is not realising the available exemptions for payroll tax. The most common exemption missed is the treatment of certain salary sacrifice items (excluding 
salary sacrificed superannuation) which reduces the eligible taxable wages for payroll tax. For example, the NSW State Government rule states payroll tax is applicable on the 
'reduced wage that the employee pays income tax on'. You can refer to the relevant NSW page below.

>Every state treat salary sacrifice differently for payroll tax purposes so be sure to check your State Government's rules before processing your payroll tax return.
