[Dealing with distractions](/do-you-deal-with-distractions) is a fundamental rule to a successful project. Microsoft Teams is a great way to get distracted. Following these options helps you to minimize message distractions:

<!--endintro-->

1. Your machine - enable Teams on start-up
    * Now with the application always on your desktop, there is no reason to want email or phone alerts
2. Teams - Open notifications settings
    * Disable email alerts - this reduces bloat in your [task list](/dones-is-your-inbox-a-task-list-only)
    * Set all settings to "Only show in feed" - this prevents distracting phone and email alerts
