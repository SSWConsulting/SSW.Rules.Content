Microsoft Dynamics Marketing has four different user types. You can see a breakdown of the difference below:


| User Type | Added to O365? | License Required? | Administrator capability? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Regular User | Yes | Yes | Yes | Most commonly used type. Possible to grant all active role types, excluding media buying. |
| Media Buyer | Yes | Yes | Yes | All active roles a regular user has plus expanded media buying and planning roles. |
| Web Portal | Yes | No | No

 | Restricted access. Intended largely to provide “View” access to specific functionalities contractors, vendors, and clients. Some edit capabilities. |
| Public | No | No | No | Selected functions globally available publicly, such as Public Libraries and Landing Pages. |

**Note:** Since there is a Web Portal type, allowing viewing of the majority of the app, only 1 or 2 Regular or Media Buyer licences need to be bought for any small to medium business, as only kep people will actually be using the majority of the functionality.
