<span class='intro'> <p>For argument's sake, it makes sense to refer to any text pop-up on screen as a 'caption'.&#160;​It is helpful to the viewers to include still or animated captions (also known as lower thirds)&#160;in your videos because they enhance or add extra information that is not fully explained by the speakers.&#160;A sub-category&#160;of captions is&#160;<em>titles</em><em>,&#160;</em>which is the term given to&#160;identifying text​, such as&#160;the opening film credits, someone's name and job title&#160;or &quot;1985 - New York City&quot;.</p> </span>

<p>Now you cant really have just one type of caption. Have defined&#160;styles for different types of videos</p><p>eg. Here are the styles SSW use for their videos&#58;</p><dl class="goodImage"><dt>​<img src="./Why%20Choose%20SSW.jpg" alt="Why Choose SSW.jpg" style="width&#58;600px;" />

You can also use this section to put in links that are related to what was said in the video as evidence (similar to footnotes or a bibliography in a book). That way, you will gain more Google juice and it will make it easier for the Product Owner to review your captions.</p>
