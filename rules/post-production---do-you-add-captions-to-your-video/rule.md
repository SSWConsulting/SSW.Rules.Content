​It is helpful to the viewers to include still or animated captions (also known as lower thirds)&#160;in your videos because they enhance or add extra information that is not fully explained by the speakers. These are not to be confused with <em>titles, </em>which is the term given to text that appears on screen, such as&#160;the opening film credits, or &quot;1985 - New York City&quot;.

<p>Remember to put any links that you've mentioned in&#160;the captions underneath your video in it's own section (with a heading such as 'Show Notes' or 'Related Content'). You can also use this section to put in links that are related to what was said in the video as evidence (similar to footnotes or a bibliography in a book). That way, you will gain more Google juice and it will make it easier for the Product Owner to review your captions.</p>
