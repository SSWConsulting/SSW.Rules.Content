Here are some tips for asking for pros, cons, and ratings:

* Be explicit about your request for pros and cons in your prompt
* Ask ChatGPT to provide a rating or ranking based on specific criteria, such as cost, quality, or efficiency
* Encourage the model to consider multiple factors when evaluating options
