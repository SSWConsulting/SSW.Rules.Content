<span class='intro'> Of course, all your servers are on UPS. (If not they should be!) How do you know that all the money you paid for a UPS was worth it thought? How many times has it saved our servers? How long do the battery's last for before they go flat? Why was a server off when you came in in the morning?<br> </span>

<p>If you get your UPS to email you when an event occurs then you will have answers to these questions.<br>The problem is that there is no uniform software that will work with all UPS's as they all have their&#160;own&#160;format.<br>All UPS's come with management software that can perform these actions. You just&#160;need&#160;to install it. 
   <br></p><p>We use&#160;an MGE&#160;UPS so we use Personal Solution Pac which allows you to run script files on events. We just call a script file which will send us an email.
