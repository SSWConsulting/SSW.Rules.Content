When working on an hourly basis, you can confuse clients when sometimes you try to talk about a few hours here and a few hours here or there.  
<!--endintro-->

Simply things and just give them these 3 numbers:


| 

| $ Billed to date | \_\_$xx\_\_(accurate on Tuesday) |
| --- | --- |
| Burndown Days Remaining | \_\_8\_\_ |
| Calendar Days Booked | \_\_4days x 2\_\_ |
| Next meeting (for Review and Retro) |
