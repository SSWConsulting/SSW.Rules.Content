Using libraries as a building block for your project is a standard in modern software development. It's fairly normal to have 10+ npm and Nuget libraries used in a full-stack project.

One of the big challenge for developers to address is when this project have been delivered to the client and then gone to maintenance mode. With no developer actively working on the project, if there is a serious vulnerability discovered in library `northwind/azure-helper@1.2.3` that is in the project, no one will be aware of it and it might cause some damage.

On the other hand, if you monitor the packages that you have installed, you can notify the client will score you an extra brownie points plus an opportunity for a follow-up client work.

## Level 0 - Manual tracking

List all the packages that are used in a notepad and cross-check with the news regularly. Not recommended because this consumes time.

## Level 1 - Using tools to scan for vulnerabilities

Modern package managers such as npm or Nuget offers a way to check for vulnerabilities in the installed libraries.

* npm: `npm audit` 
* nuget: `dotnet list package --vulnerable`

Running this command regularly can give a summarised report on known vulnerabilities installed in the project.

This is an improvement over manual tracking but still requires a developer to check out the latest code and then run the command.

## Level 2 - Automate vulnerability scanning (recommended)

Using 3rd party tools such as [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) or [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) can help you to automate vulnerability scanning.

These tools will alert you whenever there's a security vulnerabilities detected in the project and optionally raise a PR for it.

Dependabot is free for all repositories under GitHub.
