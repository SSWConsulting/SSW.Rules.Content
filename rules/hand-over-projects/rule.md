Transitioning a project smoothly is crucial, whether due to changing project assignments or planned absences. A thorough handover process ensures continuity and minimizes disruption.

It's essential to initiate the handover planning as soon as a transition is known. Review the project with the selected team member who will take over. Schedule a handover meeting with high priority.

**The handover is the responsibility of the person transitioning away from the project**

4. Discuss project roles
   1. Who is the Product Owner?
   2. Who is the Scrum Master?
   3. Any other important stakeholders?
5. Architecture and Code Review
