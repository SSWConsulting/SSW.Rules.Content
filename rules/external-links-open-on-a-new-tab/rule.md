External links should  **open in a new tab**  (a.k.a. use target="\_blank") - since browsers implemented tabs (replacing new window), it's considered a good practice to open external links in a different tab.

Main reasons are:

* Avoid 'Back-Button Fatigue';
* Keep 'User Flow';
* and keep a good track of Analytics
