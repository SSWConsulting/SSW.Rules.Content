<span class='intro'> <p>Your people are a huge part of what makes your company awesome or unique, so&#160;you should use this to your advantage by asking them to be your&#160;walking spokespersons and/or&#160;billboards.&#160;Branding​ your&#160;employees is especially important at events such as conferences, user groups&#160;and client meetings.&#160;​​​A simple way to do this is to wear branded shirts or t-shirts every day.&#160;<br></p><p>If you wear a collard shirt, your&#160;corporate uniform should be simple and&#160;stylish -&#160;don't forget that&#160;your&#160;branding can be subtle and effective at the&#160;same time.&#160;<br></p><p>Also remember that&#160;uniforms don't have to be boring or uncomfortable, but they do need to represent who you are as a company. If you decided to do something fun, pop culture t-shirts are always a&#160;popular choice, particularly at conferences,&#160;but you should take great care to make sure that&#160;the message&#160;aligns with your corporate&#160;image. If you nail this, your employees will love to wear your&#160;t-shirts to work and out in the general community, adding to your exposure.&#160;<br></p> </span>
