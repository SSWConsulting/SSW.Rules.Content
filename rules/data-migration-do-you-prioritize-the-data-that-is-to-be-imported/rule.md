Step 1 - What data?

1. Don't take all the data for the first release - Usually there are huge amounts
            of data in legacy systems - take only the most important firstly.
2. Using the planning spreadsheets included with the [Microsoft CRM Data Migration Pack](http&#58;//www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20015) - they are excellent for specifying data migration
            field mappings.


Step 2 - Sync or import?

1. Syncing and keeping the old system live is the preferred option
2. Consider writing .NET callouts - or consider Scribe Insight
