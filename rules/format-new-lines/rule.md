Sometimes when writing content, you need to make the decision to keep it on the same line or put it on a new line.

It is recommended that notes, tips and figures should be on a new line to enable better readability. It can also be benificial to bold those words.

Good way: use the Dynamics 365 (formerly CRM 2016) toolbar?
