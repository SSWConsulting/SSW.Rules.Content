Writing in large blocks of text is a common practice, but it can hinder readability. Incorporating line breaks and spacing significantly enhances content readability. This allows readers to navigate through the text more easily, absorb information more effectively, and stay engaged with the material.

::: info
**Warning:** For web (HTML/Markdown), line breaks **should not be used to to create layout spacing**!
You should use CSS margin and/or padding instead.

Learn more on [HTML `<br>` Tag: The Dos and Don'ts of Adding an HTML Line Break](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/html-line-break).

See the [more information on line breaks in Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#line-breaks).

On the other hand, in regards to **emails** and/or **informal documents**, line breaks can be used for spacing. In these cases, correct syntax is not crucial, and breaking a line is more convinient than dealing with margins/line spacing.

### Long paragraphs

Consider breaking lines/paragraphs when you have a long block of text. You should aim to separate the information by context.

### Notes, Tips, PS

Content elements like **Note**, **Tip**, **PS** (and similar) should be on a new line to enable better readability. It is beneficial to bold those words.

### URLs

Breaking a line is also recommended before URLs.

### Headings

It's a good idea to have some space after headings.

### Multiple items as lists

If you text has information that can be turned into multiple items, you should do so, by creating a list. For example, when sending PBIs for a Sprint.

::: greybox
I have 2 PBIs in the coming Sprint: Product Backlog Item 88994: Performance | Create a new App Service plan and Product Backlog Item 88823: Azure | Create a new App Service Plan in West US for SL production resource group. I will do the IoC after.

I will do the IoC after.

**Note:** On the example above, see how changing from "Product Backlog Item" to "PBI" also helps with readability.
However, you should [only use acronyms when the recipient is familiar with the term](/avoid-acronyms).

### Images and captions

It is also recommended to include spaces after an image or a figure description. These elements need breathing space to help users focus on them.
