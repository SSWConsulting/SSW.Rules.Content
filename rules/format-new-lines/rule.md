Sometimes when writing content, you need to make the decision to keep it on the same line or put it on a new line.

It is recommended that notes, tips and figures should be on a new line to enable better readability. It can also be beneficial to bold those words.

‚ùóÔ∏è Important - Line breaks in web pages (HTML) can be used, but when done to create spacing it becomes a ‚ùå bad practice!

When referring to emails and/or informal documents, line breaks can be used for spacing since they are easier than dealing with margins, and we don‚Äôt care about syntax.

It is recommended to include spaces after a figure description - in web design, use CSS margins to achieve this.
