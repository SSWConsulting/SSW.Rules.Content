In the old days, if employees wanted something automated they would have to call up the development team and go through a long bureaucratic process to get a custom API built. These days, there are heaps of tools that make this easy, quick and simple.

## PowerAutomate
PowerAutomate lets any random user automate away things they find painful. They can go from zero to hero in under a day!

PowerAutomate is the perfect tool for non-developers who want to spin-up a bit of automation to address tasks that cause daily pain for them personally. 

However, once the logic gets complex or you need to integrate with custom systems, it's time to look at another solution.

## Azure Functions
