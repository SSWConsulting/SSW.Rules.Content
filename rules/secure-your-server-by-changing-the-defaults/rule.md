1. Disable defaults
    * Disable Administrator and Rename it, then create a new "honeypot" Administrator account with no permissions.
    * Disable Guest on the SQL
    * Change Port 1433
    * Delete the sample databases - (AdventureWorks, Northwind and Pubs). These have a Public Role which is a security risk and allow Massive SQL Statements
2. Other security issues
    * Use a service account with a strong password
    * DoÂ not run SQL Server service as an administrator
    * Run in integrated security mode
    * Run on NTFS file system - Encrypt the data files
