Prompts are the instructions that you input. They can be as simple or as complex as you like.

## Prompting basics

A general prompt might be "an image of a sunset over the ocean," which tells the AI exactly what you're looking for.

::: greybox
“A brown dog on a skateboard”
:::
::: good  
Figure: Good example - A basic prompt
:::

A well-structured prompt often has more details, in the format “A {{ TYPE OF PICTURE }} of a {{ MAIN SUBJECT }}, {{ STYLE CUES }}”.

::: greybox
“A photograph of a robot, cartoon style”
:::
::: good  
Figure: Good example - A basic prompt with style cues.

You can add more even more detail to make a descriptive prompt by following this template:

::: greybox
**{{ ADJECTIVE }}, {{ EMOTION }}, {{ SUBJECT }}, {{ STYLE }}, {{ COLOR }}**
:::
::: good
Figure: Good example - Use this prompt template!

## Prompt length

Prompts that are too short do not give the AI enough information to create an image matching your idea. It is a good idea to be detailed with your prompts, but too much detail is equally likely to give the AI too many instructions, which "confuses" it and can reduce the acurracy.

::: greybox
"A landscape"
:::

::: bad  
Figure: Bad example - A vague prompt like this gives an ambiguous image
:::

::: greybox
"A snowy mountain landscape at sunset with warm hues in the style of a photograph"
:::

::: good  
Figure: Good example - A detailed and concise description, but not too long. This will provide the AI with specific elements to incorporate, resulting in an accurate image.
:::

::: greybox
"A snowy mountain landscape at sunset... Majestic peaks rise high into the sky, their rugged outlines etched against the fading golden light. Adorned with a pristine layer of glistening snow, they stand as silent sentinels, towering over the vast expanse below. The snow-covered slopes cascade down in gentle curves, inviting adventurers and nature lovers alike. In the foreground, a small creek meanders through the snow-covered landscape, flowing steadily beneath a delicate layer of ice. Over the creek, a footbridge stretches, connecting the two banks. Two travelers cross the bridge, their footprints leaving a mark on the pristine snow. The frozen trees, adorned with icicles, stand like witnesses to the passage of time."

Figure: Bad example - This prompt is too long. It will probably just look like the one above!
