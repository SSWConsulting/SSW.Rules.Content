## Prompting basics

A general prompt might be "an image of a sunset over the ocean," which tells the AI exactly what you're looking for.

A well-structured prompt often has more details, in the format “A {{ TYPE OF PICTURE }} of a {{ MAIN SUBJECT }}, {{ STYLE CUES }}”.

You can add more even more detail to make a descriptive prompt by following this template:

**{{ ADJECTIVE }}, {{ EMOTION }}, {{ SUBJECT }}, {{ STYLE }}, {{ COLOR }}**
