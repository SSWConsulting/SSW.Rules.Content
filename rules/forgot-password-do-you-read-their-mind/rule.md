Unfortunately here is the normal routine to get an email       with your password.

1. You go to a Login form, enter your email and password, 
     and click the 'Login' button.
2. You get a validation message like 'Incorrect Password'.
3. Then you have to click a 'Forgot Password' link to go to 
     another 'Get Password' form, and then they almost always ask 
     you to enter your email again and then click 'Get Password' 
     button.

Question : Why do 99% of the web sites out there, ask you to - Enter you email again (they have already got it) - Then click 'Get Password' (you have already clicked the link 'Forgot Password')
```





```
Answer : Because they are not trying to read your mind.
```



**The goal should be:** 
Be more efficient and user-friendly and save them a step. Please DO NOT bother users to do any more redundant work.

Instead enter their email when they click 'Forgot Password' link.
