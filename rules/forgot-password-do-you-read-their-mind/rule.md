Unfortunately here is the normal routine to get an email       with your password.

1. You go to a Login form, enter your email and password,
     and click the 'Login' button.
2. You get a validation message like 'Incorrect Password'.
3. Then you have to click a 'Forgot Password' link to go to
     another 'Get Password' form, and then they almost always ask
     you to enter your email again and then click 'Get Password'
     button.

**Question**: Why do 99% of the websites out there, ask you to - Enter you email again (they have already got it) - Then click 'Get Password' (you have already clicked the link 'Forgot Password')  
**Answer**: Because they are not trying to read your mind.

**The goal should be:**
Be more efficient and user-friendly and save them a step. Please DO NOT bother users to do any more redundant work.

Instead enter their email when they click 'Forgot Password' link.
