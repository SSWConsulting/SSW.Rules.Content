Although Sharegate migration tool works very well to help you with your SharePoint migration, some manual steps might be necessary to complete the migration. These extra steps include:


<!--endintro-->

* Configuring any custom Search scopes/refinements
* Remove permissions from On-premise Intranet (or turn it to Read-Only)
* Ask users to change their mapped folders
* Communicate about the changes
