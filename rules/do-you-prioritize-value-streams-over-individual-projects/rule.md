You're juggling multiple projects, each with its own set of objectives and deadlines. While each project seems important, you notice that they are not necessarily aligned with the overall business goals. This is where prioritizing value streams over individual projects becomes crucial.

## What Are Value Streams?

Value streams are a series of steps that an organization uses to build solutions that provide a continuous flow of value to a customer. Unlike project-centric approaches, focusing on value streams aligns all activities to deliver the most customer and business value.

### Benefits of Prioritizing Value Streams

- **Alignment with Business Goals**: Value streams ensure that all work is aligned with the strategic objectives of the business.
- **Efficiency**: By focusing on value streams, you eliminate waste and improve the flow of work.
- **Customer-Centric**: This approach ensures that what is being delivered actually provides value to the customer.
