<span class='intro'> Schema is Microdata that helps a search engine read and serve your custom content. The schema markup is in the HTML code of your site. If you’ve ever used rich snippets, you’ll understand exactly what schema is all about.<div><br>When a search engines crawls through your website and find this data, it formats it neatly into a rich snippet that gets displayed in the search results. For example, in a rating rich snippet for a recipe, you'll see a group of stars representing a rating that appears under a websites page title. The number of reviews also shows up beside the stars and the overall rating number. This is just one type of schema; there are many more to explore.</div><div><br>Schema.org provides a list of the most common types of schema markup. You can visit the <a href="https&#58;//schema.org/docs/schemas.html">Organization of Schemas</a> page to see this list. Check out the types that are best suited to your business.<br></div> </span>
