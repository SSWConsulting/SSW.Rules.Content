When you look at the Service Calendar, you want to be able to see, at a glance, who is working on what.



To do this, the subject field of appointments should be as follows:


<!--endintro-->


::: greybox
 **Client [Project] - Name[s]** 
:::





The project name (in parentheses) is optional and only used if there is more than one project happening simultaneously.

You can have 1 or many names, depending on the booking.






::: greybox
Go to ACME Corp
Work onsite for ACME Corp
Mehmet working at ACME Corp

:::



::: bad
Figure: Bad example - all inconsistent and hard to read
:::



::: greybox
ACME Corp - Mehmet
 ACME Corp - Mehmet, Dan
ACME Corp (SharePoint) - Dan
:::




::: good
Figure: Good Examples
:::




The same format should also be used for leave requests ([the same for normal calendar appointments/invitations](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=3a0a1c31-c984-4d3f-b3c8-f071b092a9b7)).



::: greybox
Leave - Mehmet
