Open Graph is a metadata tag that allows you to control what content shows up when a page is shared on social media networks.

<!--endintro-->

It should be placed on the &lt;head&gt; section of your page. The most used properties are:



```
<meta property="og:title" content="Your Custom Title" />
<meta property="og:description" content="Your custom description of the page." />
<meta property="og:image" content="https://www.YourCustomImage.jpg"/>
```




::: bad  
![Figure: Bad example - Shared link has no image and the title was "guessed" by LinkedIn](open-graph-bad.jpg)  
:::


::: good  
![Figure: Good example - Shared link has a nice image and title, both defined via Open Graph tags](opengraph-good.jpg)  
:::

**Note:** For LinkedIn you might need to add the prefix as following:



```
<metaprefix="og: http://ogp.me/ns#" property='og:title' content="Microsoft Azure | SSW Consulting - Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne"/>
```
