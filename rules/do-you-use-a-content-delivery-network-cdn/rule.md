<span class='intro'> <p>​If your site takes too long to load, there is a high chance your users will not wait for it to finish&#160;loading&#160;and abandon viewing it. It is therefore important that we use techniques to make pages&#160;load as quickly as possible. One of these techniques is to use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to reduce the&#160;network&#160;latency for delivering&#160;pages,&#160;images,&#160;javascript and CSS libraries&#160;to&#160;users​.&#160;This results in faster page&#160;load times and a&#160;​better experience for your users.<br></p> </span>

<strong style="color&#58;#333333;">What is a CDN?</strong><br>CDN&#160;is short for a Content Delivery&#160;Network. It&#160;is a system of distributed servers (network) that deliver pages and other Web content to a user, based on the geographic locations of the user, the origin of the webpage and the content delivery server.<div><br><strong style="color&#58;#333333;">Why use a CDN?</strong></div><div><strong style="color&#58;#333333;"></strong>A website may be hosted in a particular region, but have the majority of its users coming from an entirely different region – for example, if your site is&#160;hosted in North America, GTmetrix(A&#160;free tool that analyzes your page's speed performance)&#160;might report fast speeds based on our default test location, but if a good chunk of your users come from China, their speed will not be as fast as you experience it to be.<br>Using a CDN can improve your user’s experience in terms of speed, and as we know – speed matters!​<br>Ensuring a consistent experience for all your users is important.<br>CDNs not only ensure a faster experience to your users, but they also help to prevent site crashes in the event of traffic surges – CDNs help to distribute bandwidth across multiple servers, instead of allowing one server to handle all traffic.​<br></div><div><br></div><div><strong>How to choose a CDN?</strong><br></div><div>When choosing a CDN provider, take into account where your user base is located and which CDN provider support those locations.
