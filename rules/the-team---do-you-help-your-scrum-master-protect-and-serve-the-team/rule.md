Part of the ScrumMaster’s role is to protect the team from distractions so they can deliver on their commitment, to ensure agreed process is followed and to help all roles keep their promises.&#160; 

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <p>It is incumbent on each team member to refuse to do any other work on a Scrum Day of more than 15 minutes.&#160; Requests for work of more than 15 minutes must be referred to the ScrumMaster.&#160; The only exception is for Production Issues that absolutely require the attention of a Team Member and nobody else is available.&#160; In this case, if the ScrumMaster does not respond within 15 minutes, the requestor can insist that the member starts work on the Production Issue.</p>
<p>Any absences by any team member must be negotiated through the ScrumMaster.</p>
<p>Anything to do with process and the official meetings must be through the ScrumMaster.</p>
<p>For details on promises, see the rule <a href="/Standards/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/ContractBetweenMembersOfScrumTeams.aspx">“Do you understand the implied contract (promises) between Members of the Scrum Team?”</a></p>
