We have a rule on [using relevant words on links](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=f19d44f5-5c5b-4cc8-905d-3f7ddb1edf58). How to make sure people will know which words are links and what the links are after printing a page?

<!--endintro-->

As a good practice, you should use CSS to print the URL's next to each link when printing:



```
@media print {
a[href]:after {
content: " (" attr(href) ")";
}
}
```


In specific cases, like on breadcrumbs and logo, you don't want these URL's, so you should override the style:



```
@media print {
.breadcrumba[href]:after {
content: none;
}
```
