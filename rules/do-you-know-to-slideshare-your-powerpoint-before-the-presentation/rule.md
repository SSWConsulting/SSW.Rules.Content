[SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/) is an online archive of presentations and other documents. It is the best way to store your training material for search engines and is easily accessible.

Check out the SlideShare shown above: [Supercharging your Xamarin app! 3 must use libraries](https://www.slideshare.net/ChrisBriggsy/supercharging-your-xamarin-app-3-must-use-libraries)

Follow these steps to ensure you get as much coverage as possible before and after your presentation:

1. Prepare your PowerPoint as normal. Refer to [SSW Rules to Better Presentations](/rules-to-better-powerpoint-presentations)
2. Work on your presentation from SharePoint to allow sharing
3. Get your content [checked by a tester and a designer](/do-you-get-your-ppt-tester-to-do-a-test-please-preferably-a-designer))
4. Before you upload to SlideShare, add two slides:
       1. On the last slide, add a generic SlideShare link such as slideshare.net/YourAccount - E.g. slideshare.net/SSWConsulting/
       2. On the first slide add a note that contains the version. This is so that you can compare easily what version is on SharePoint and what is on SlideShare

   ![Figure: Add the version number on the bottom right corner of your first or second slide](versionnumber.jpg)
5. Upload to SlideShare – Make sure the title **doesn’t** have the version number on it
6. Go to “My uploads” and change the presentation title to have the version number
   ![Figure: Adding the version number to the title (after uploading) won’t affect the URL](version-number-slideshare.jpg)
7. Create a "_OnSlideshare.txt" file with the Slideshare URL and add it to SharePoint on the same folder where the original PPT is
8. Now you can present!
