What is Slideshare? [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/) is an online archive of presentations and other documents. It is the best way to store your training material for search engines and is easily accessible.

Check out the slideshare shown above: '['Supercharging your Xamarin app! 3 must use libraries](http://www.slideshare.net/ChrisBriggsy/supercharging-your-xamarin-app-3-must-use-libraries)"

Follow these steps to ensure you get as much coverage as possible before and after your presentation.

<!--endintro-->

1. Prepare your PowerPoint as normal. Refer to [SSW Rules to Better Presentations.](/rules-to-better-powerpoint-presentations)
2. Work on your presentation from SharePoint to allow sharing.
3. Get your content checked by a tester and a designer (See our Rule: [Do you get someone to do a 'Test Please'?](/do-you-get-your-ppt-tester-to-do-a-test-please-preferably-a-designer))
4. Before you upload to Slideshare, add two slides:
    1. On the last slide, add a generic Slideshare link such as http://www.slideshare.net/YourAccount - E.g. http://www.Slideshare.net/SSWConsulting/
    2. On the first slide add a note that contains the version. This is so that you can compare easily what version is on SharePoint and what is on Slideshare
![](version-number.jpg)**Figure: Add the version number on the bottom right corner of your first or second slide**
5. Upload to Slideshare – Make sure the title  **doesn’t** have the version number on it
6. Go to “My uploads” and change the presentation title to have the version number
![](version-number-slideshare.jpg)**Figure: Adding the version number to the title (after uploading) won’t affect the URL**
7. Create a "\_OnSlideshare.txt" file with the Slideshare URL and add it to SharePoint on the same folder where the original PPT is
8. Now you can present!
