  <p>What is Slideshare? <a shape="rect" href="http&#58;//www.slideshare.net/">Slideshare</a> is an online archive of presentations and other documents.&#160;It is the best way to store your training material for search engines and is easily accessible. Follow these steps to ensure you get as much coverage as possible before and after your presentation.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Prepare your PowerPoint as normal. Refer to <a shape="rect" href="/Communication/RulesToBetterPowerpointPresentations/Pages/default.aspx">SSW Rules to Better Presentations.</a> </li>
    <li>Work on your presentation from SharePoint to allow sharing. </li>
    <li>Get your content checked by a tester and a designer (See our Rule&#58; <a shape="rect" href="/Communication/RulesToBetterPowerpointPresentations/Pages/DoyougetsomeonetodoaTestPlease.aspx">Do you get someone to do a 'Test Please'?</a>) </li>
                            <li>Before you upload to Slideshare, add two slides&#58;
                                <ol>
                                    <li>On the last slide, add a generic Slideshare link such as http&#58;//www.slideshare.net/YourAccount
                                        - eg <a shape="rect" href="http&#58;//www.slideshare.net/SSWConsulting/">
                                            http&#58;//www.Slideshare.net/SSWConsulting/</a> </li>
                                    <li>On the first slide add a note that contains the version. This is so that you can compare easily what version is on SharePoint and what is on Slideshare </li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>    <li>Rename your PowerPoint to include the version number. For example, if the file in SharePoint is called “SharePoint-Jonah-Lomu-of-CMS.pptx” it will be renamed to “SharePoint-Jonah-Lomu-of-CMS-ver1-9.pptx” </li>
    <li>Upload to Slideshare </li>
    <li>Don’t forget to add a “_OnSlideshare.txt” in SharePoint that contains the url </li>
    <li>Now you can present! </li>
</ol>
