  <p>Make sure you follow these steps when preparing your presentation to ensure your work is of the highest quality... and don't forget to archive your presentation on Slideshare!</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Prepare your PowerPoint </li>
    <li>Put it in SharePoint for the versioning </li>
    <li>Get it tested by a Tester (for the content) </li>
    <li>Get it tested by a Designer (so it looks good) </li>
    <li>Add a generic Slideshare link to the last slide </li>
    <li>Add the version number on the first page (this will help you later know what version is on slideshare) </li>
    <li>Check the name of the ppt eg. SharePoint-Jonah-Lomu-of-CMS_Adam-Cogan_V1-0.pptx </li>
    <li>Upload to Slideshare<br>
    Eg. <a shape="rect" href="http&#58;//www.slideshare.net/CraigBailey/sharepoint-as-a-web-cms">http&#58;//www.slideshare.net/CraigBailey/sharepoint-as-a-web-cms</a> <img title="You are now leaving SSW" src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/images/external.gif" /> </li>
    <li>In sharepoint add a _OnSlideShare.txt with the url inside it </li>
    <li>Now you are ready to present </li>
</ol>
