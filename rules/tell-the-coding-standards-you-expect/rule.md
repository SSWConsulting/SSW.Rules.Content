The code within your solution should be consistent. (We all know that)

In an open source project the easy way to ensure that all developers share and are aware of the expectations is to include and ENGINEERING-GUIDELINES.md markdown file that includes important technical considerations like:

* Copyright header requirements
* Approved external dependencies
* Coding guidelines and standards
* Source control requirements
* Branching strategy
* Solution and project folder structure and naming
* Unit testing requirements
