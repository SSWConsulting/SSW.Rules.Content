Most people do not like conflict, and so some people may shy away from dealing with a potentially uncomfortable situation, rather than addressing the problem.

When someone brings to your attention that they are not happy with something, it's important to address it so that it doesn't happen again in the future. 

<!--endintro-->

### Example Scenario - missing a deadline

Consider a scenario where your boss tells you they are unhappy that you missed a deadline, but you thought there were good reasons for missing it. Don't get bogged down in the justification for why it happened. Instead, acknowledge what happened, and drop everything (within reason) to prioritise this work until it's done.

Do not ignore the problem (by continuing business as usual) as it will only escalate, fix it now (by prioritising this work)!

### Common Symptoms

Some consequences of unsolved problems with clients are:

* Client dissatisfaction and loss of trust
* Unpaid invoices
* Cancelled bookings

If you notice the above, alert your management ASAP.

### Tips

1. Being Chased - If someone has followed you up repeatedly, get back to them as soon as possible with a response as it shows you care.
2. Communicating Progress - If you are not able to fix the problem immediately, let the person know how long the issue will likely take to fix.
3. [Fix bugs first](https://ssw.com.au/rules/management-do-you-fix-bugs-first/) - they become more expensive and complex over time.
6. [Make client complaints a positive experience](https://ssw.com.au/rules/make-complaints-a-positive-experience/) - retain customer loyalty and potentially gain new customers.
7. Avoid bad blood - If the conflict was unpleasant, it's often a good idea to offer an olive branch after the fact by sending a quick message later on to clear the air.

### When to push back

* One-off task - most of the time, if you're unhappy with some work you've been given, but it's a one-off task, don't stress the small stuff, and just get it done.

* Recurring task - however, if it's something you're being asked to do repeatedly, and you're unhappy with it, still do the task, but make sure you clearly communicate any missgivings. Consider sending a "[For the record email](https://ssw.com.au/rules/for-the-record/)"
