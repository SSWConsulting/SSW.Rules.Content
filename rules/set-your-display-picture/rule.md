In person conversations are much better than chats over the phone. Skype or Teams calls with video cams are great, but you wonâ€™t do that all the time for bandwidth and processing power reasons. The next best thing is to have a great professional picture of yourself.

<!--endintro-->

- Avoid using a built-in image
- Ideally, have a photo that shows head and top of shoulders close up. Not too far away
- Your face must not be obstructed with other objects or excessive head cover (e.g. ski mask)
- Not blurred, pixelated, washed out or over-exposed image. You should be recognizable in your high quality picture
- An actual photo of yourself. Not a cartoon, objects or family member(s)
