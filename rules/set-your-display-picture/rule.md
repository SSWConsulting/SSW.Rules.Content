While personal conversations are often better than chat, instant messaging is a necessary part of modern communication. To make the experience more human and professional, use a clear, nice photo of yourself as your display picture.

* Avoid using a built-in image
* Have a photo that shows head and top of shoulders close up. Not too far away
* Face must not be obstructed with other objects or excessive head cover (e.g. ski mask)
* Not blurred, pixelated, washed out or over-exposed image. You should be recognizable in your high-quality picture
* An actual photo of yourself. No cartoons, objects or family members
