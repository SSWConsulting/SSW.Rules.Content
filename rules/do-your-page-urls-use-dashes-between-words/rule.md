<p>
                    The text of a URL should make sense and relate to the content of the relevant page.
                    Apart from helping with Google Juice users frequently read URL's.
                <br></p><p>
                    There are a few options for how you format the text of a URL. The following suggestions
                    are in preference order&#58;

               The caveat here is that it will only work if the URL is in the clear on the page.</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">
