<span class='intro'> <p>
                    The text of a URL should make sense and relate to the content of the relevant page.
                    Apart from helping with Google Juice users frequently read URL's.
                <br></p><p>
                    There are a few options for how you format the text of a URL. The following suggestions
                    are in preference order&#58;
                </p> </span>

<ol><li>Dashes between words&#58;

      <b>RulesToBetterWebsiteLayouts.aspx</b></li><li>Upper case for appropriate words&#58; 
      <b>RulestoBetterWebsiteLayouts.aspx</b></li><li>Underscores between words&#58;

               The caveat here is that it will only work if the URL is in the clear on the page.</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">
                <b>Note&#58; </b>This could only be done with certain links as others are postbacks as well.
