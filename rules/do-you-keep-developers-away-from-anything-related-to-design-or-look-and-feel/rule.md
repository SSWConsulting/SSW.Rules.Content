<span class='intro'> <p><span style="color&#58;#000000;font-family&#58;verdana, sans-serif;font-size&#58;12px;line-height&#58;16.8px;"></span>Developers should never do design work. A bad design can be dangerous for the project. It's the web designer’s responsibility to create the overall look and feel of the website and define anything related to layout, typography, color selection, branding and overall consistency. The designer is also responsible for any image processing, web optimization and browser/platform testing of the website.​</p> </span>
