Timesheets are essential as they are required to bill clients or to document the work that is done, and record progress against projects.Â Making sure that timesheets are in on time help keep things running smoothly and prevent major gaps in reporting, billing, or client value.

See [Rules to Better Timesheets](/rules-to-better-timesheets).
