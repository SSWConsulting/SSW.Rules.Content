If you use the DataGridView control which is read only, you had better set row select mode as "FullRowSelect". If the data cannot be modified we can let users select the whole row instead of one column.

What's the next step? It's even better if you enable multiple row selection and copying, see [Do your List Views support multiple selection and copying](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterWindowsForms.aspx#ListView) on [Rules to Better Windows Forms Applications](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterWindowsForms.aspx).
