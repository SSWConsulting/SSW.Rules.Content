How do you want customers to send you feedback? Phone calls? Emails? A website?
There are a plenty of web applications to choose from, but one that is a clear winner.

<!--endintro-->

In the past we had a couple of main options:

* [UserVoice](https://www.uservoice.com/)
* [UserEcho](https://userecho.com/)

[UserVoice](https://www.uservoice.com/) was as popular platform to collect, manage, and prioritize user feedback. It has a voting and tickets system out of the box.

Many software houses used this for their products Eg. SSW CodeAuditor, SSW LinkAuditor, etc

![Figure: Google Trends shows that UserVoice and UserEcho are declining in populatrity, while GitHub Discussions is slowly but surely climbing.](google-trends-ghdiscussions-uservoice-userecho.png)
