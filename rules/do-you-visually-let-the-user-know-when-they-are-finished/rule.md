When a user reaches the last page of a wizard, a visual indication should be provided                     so that they know that the process has finished. We use a finish flag to do this.

<!--endintro-->
<dl class="badImage">&lt;dt&gt; 
      <img alt="ssw SQL Auditor - Results" src="../../assets/BadFinishedPage.gif" style="margin:5px;width:550px;">
   &lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: Bad Example - This is the last page of the wizard but it is not obvious because the finish flag is small and the "Next" button still enabled</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage">&lt;dt&gt; 
      <img border="0" alt="SSW Link Auditor - Finished" src="../../assets/GoodFlagImage.png" style="margin:5px;width:640px;">
   &lt;/dt&gt;<dd> Figure: Good Example - Good quality Finish flag on the last page of a wizard.</dd></dl>
