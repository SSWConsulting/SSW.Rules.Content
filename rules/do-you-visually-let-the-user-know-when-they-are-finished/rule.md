<span class='intro'> <p>When a user reaches the last page of a wizard, a visual indication should be provided
                    so that they know that the process has finished. We use a finish flag to do this.</p> </span>

   </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Bad Example - This is the last page of the wizard but it is not obvious because the finish flag is small and the &quot;Next&quot; button still enabled</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt>
