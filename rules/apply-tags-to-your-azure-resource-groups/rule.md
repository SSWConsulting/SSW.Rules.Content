<p>To help maintain order and control in your Azure environment, applying tags to resources and resources groups is the way to go.<br></p><p>Azure has the Tag feature, which allows you to apply different Tag Names and values to Resources and Resource Groups:​<br></p>

<p>You can leverage this feature to organize your resources in a logical way, not relying in the names only. E.g.<br></p><ul><li><b>Owner tag:</b> You can specify who owns that resource</li><li><b>Environment tag: </b>You can specify which environment that resource is in</li></ul><p><b>Tip:</b> Do not forget to have a strong naming convention document stating how those tags and resources should be named. You can use this Microsoft guide as a starter point:
