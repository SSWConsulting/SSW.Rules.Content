<span class='intro'> <p>So you started your site with simple navigation but then you find 
yourself a few years later with site navigation that is saturated with 
links and everything looks messy.<br></p><p>Mega menu allows you to present your links in groups 
and make use of typography, icons and supporting images to explain 
user's choices.</p> </span>

<p>By dividing site navigation into groups users will have better view of your site's structure at a glance and thus presenting them with meaningful choices. You can also group key pages together and give them emphasis.</p><p>Of course, don't use a mega dropdown menu just because you can. Turning your normal navigation into mega-menu whilst keeping it as one continuous level is generally a no-no. in the same manner, just because mega-menus have room, doesn't mean you should overload them.</p><dl class="badImage"><dt> <img alt="long dropdown menu" src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/SSW/Standards/Rules/Images/longmenu.jpg" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;167px;" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Bad Example - Long drop down menu requires scrolling and difficult to see at a glance.<br></dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt> <img alt="mega menu" src="megamenu.jpg" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good Example - Links are grouped into distinct category</dd></dl> <dl class="image"> <dt> â€‹<img src="mobilemenu.jpg" alt="mobilemenu.jpg" style="margin&#58;0px;width&#58;500px;height&#58;391px;" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Bear in mind that mobile menus are limited</dd></dl>
