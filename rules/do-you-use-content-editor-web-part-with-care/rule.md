However, there is a scary hidden trap!

So what’s bad with the Content Editor Web Part?<br>
<ul>
    <li>The content in a content editor web part is not version controlled. </li>
    <li>If an editor accidentally overwrites a previous copy – there’s no way to go back. </li>
    <li>If an editor accidentally deletes a Content Editor Web Part – the content in it is lost. </li>
    <li>Data loss is always bad – and Content Editor Web Part gives you many different ways you can easily lose data... you need tread carefully and know the risks! </li>
</ul>
<br>
The best practice is&#58; <br>
<ol>
    <li>Do your content editing in the Content Editor Web Part, or in SharePoint Designer.</li>
    <li>Click the Source Editor button afterwards to get the&#160;raw html view. </li>
    <li>Copy and save this to a plain HTML file, and save the file in the page library (which is version controlled). </li>
    <li>In the Content Editor Web Part – link to the HTML page’s URL.<br>
    a.If the text is very tiny – may be just a big heading, you may not want to do this.<br>
    b.Using Content Link is also another way you can re-use the same text in different web pages and update them in one place – very good for big banners. </li>
</ol>
