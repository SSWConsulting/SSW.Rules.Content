<span class='intro'> 
  <p>It is a good idea to run a pre-migration check on the SharePoint 2007 before starting the migration process.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Check you have followed <span style="text-decoration&#58;underline;"><a href="/Pages/Do-you-add-stsadm-to-environmental-variables.aspx"><span style="text-decoration&#58;underline;">Do you add stsadm to the environmental variables?</span></a></span> </li>
    <li>Open up <b>cmd</b> with Administrator privileges</li>
    <li>Run the following command&#58; <b>stsadm –o preupgradecheck<br>
    <br>
    </b><img alt="" src="preupgradecheck.png" />&#160;<b><br>
    <font class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal" size="+0">Figure 3 - Check the pre-migration report. The only thing that is allowed to fail is “FeatureInfo”. This is because a custom feature won’t migrate and developers need to create a build targeted for SharePoint 2010</font></b></li>
    <li>Save the HTML file that was generated and email it to your companies SharePoint Master. (Don’t print it as its very large)</li>
    <li>Have the <span style="text-decoration&#58;underline;"><a href="/Pages/Do-you-have-a-SharePoint-Master.aspx"><span style="text-decoration&#58;underline;">SharePoint Master</span></a></span> sign off on the pre-migration check and inform you if there are any site collections or content sources that are no longer needed and can be ignored for migration</li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
 </span>
