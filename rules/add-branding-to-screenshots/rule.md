You can communicate better by using screenshots with balloons and other visual elements (arrows, shapes, and highlights) instead of only text. [Read the benefits of using screenshots](/screenshots-do-you-use-balloons-instead-of-a-wall-of-text).

We recommend you define a standard style for your visual elements by changing the default colors and shapes according to your branding.
