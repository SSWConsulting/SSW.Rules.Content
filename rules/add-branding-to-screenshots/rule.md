It is great when people use screenshots. You can communicate better by using screenshots with balloons and other visual elements (arrows, shapes, and highlights) instead of only text. [Read the benefits of using screenshots](/screenshots-do-you-use-balloons-instead-of-a-wall-of-text).

<!--endintro-->

We recommend you **define a standard style for your visual elements by changing the default colors and shapes according to your branding**.

See some examples of different visual elements under same branding:

![Figure: Or do you like the red box?](screenshot2.png)

![Figure: Or do you like the yellow highlight?](screenshot3.png)
