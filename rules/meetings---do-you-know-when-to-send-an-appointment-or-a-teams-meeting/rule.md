Sending appointments from Teams feels less natural than from Outlook but there are some great benefits:

* Appointment -  You don’t need to remember everyone’s name - The whole team is invited
* Appointment - In the appointment, it auto-generates a link so that everyone goes to the right place to attend
* Visibility - It shows up in Teams Calendar
* Visibility - It appears in the Teams chat (for the channel that was invited)
* Visibility – When the appointment is beginning the app pops up with a button to “Join”
* History - If you decide to record the meeting, the link to the recording shows up in the chat history as well







**Important:** Although the meeting app works great to organize Teamwork such as Scrum meetings or other client meetings, it is not very suitable for more global events such as a retreat or a conference. At SSW we use Microsoft Outlook appointments in those instances.

            <br>
         &lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: Bad Example - This appointment was created using Outlook using Zoom - the team members needed to be added to the appointment individually and there are too many options on how to join the meeting.<br></dd></dl>

<dl class="goodImage">&lt;dt&gt;
      <img src="team meetings - appointment from teams.jpg" alt="teams meeting - invitation link.jpg" style="width:750px;">
   &lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: Good Example - I know this appointment was created in Microsoft Teams since it was created on behalf of the team (see sender) and at the bottom it has a link so that people can click and join the correct meeting (even without Teams installed)<br></dd></dl>

   &lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dt&gt;To setup a Teams meeting, simply navigate to "Calendar" and then either "Meet Now" or "New Meeting".<br>&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dt&gt;

You can select a Channel to meet in and by doing so, members of the Team in which this channel lives will see a Channel activity that you can click to directly jump in the meeting.

Microsoft Teams will also send out an email invitation email for the meeting - this is especially useful when inviting people outside your organization.
