<dl class="image"><dt>​ <img src="/PublishingImages/finishing-a-feature-with-world-class-flow.jpg" alt="" />  </dt><dd>Note&#58; This rule applies&#160;to git. For branching advice in TFVC, see&#160;<a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=cd330379-4568-45fa-bd68-7229044697b7">Do you know when to branch in TFVC?</a></dd></dl><p>The best way to handle continuous development and deployment is following <a href="https&#58;//guides.github.com/introduction/flow/">GitHub Flow</a>. The basic idea is to always deploy from <strong> master</strong>, and to create a feature branch for every feature. When the feature is complete, it is merged back to master via a pull request, which provides a trigger for other developers to build.</p><p>Using this strategy, <strong> master </strong>is always production-ready and deployable.</p>

<p> <b>a) Create a &quot;feature branch&quot; for every&#160;PBI</b></p><p>When starting a PBI from the task board, create a branch from <b> master</b> with a&#160;descriptive name for that feature.</p><dl class="badImage"><dt> <img alt="git branch start-stuff" src="/PublishingImages/BadBranchName.png" data-pin-nopin="true" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Bad example - Branch name is not descriptive</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt> <img alt="git branch create-basic-web-application" src="/PublishingImages/GoodBranchName.png" data-pin-nopin="true" /> </dt><dd> Figure&#58; Good Example - Branch name describes the intent of the change</dd></dl><p>
   <strong>It is critical that this branch always comes off master, not another feature branch. Master is the only branch that is mandated to be in a deployable state, so any other option is unsafe.</strong></p><p>Obviously, we're creating a lot of branches and merging a lot under this strategy - and that's ok. &#160;Be sure to keep your PBIs small (as per&#160;<a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=2e446681-6eff-4cec-b955-e530edc4cdc8">do you break large tasks into smaller tasks</a>), and you will not have much merge pain.</p><p>The benefit of creating feature branches is to reduce the number of conflicts and churn of unfinished code during development of a feature. &#160;It allows features to be developed independently of each other and reduces the amount of expensive &quot;pull latest from the server, and rebuild everything&quot; operations, as well as greatly limiting the impact of commits with unfinished code.</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">
   <b>b) Code away and complete the PBI</b><br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">
   <b>c) Create a commit - it will contain your changed files on your local PC&#160;</b></p><p>While working, commit frequently to this branch with nice, descriptive messages. For example, &quot;Added a field to hold the product category to our timesheet read model&quot; and &quot;added a column to the timesheet summary UI for the product category&quot;.</p><dl class="badImage"><dt> <img alt="git commit -m &quot;Started report change&quot;" src="/PublishingImages/BadCommitMessage.png" data-pin-nopin="true" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Bad Example - Commit message does not describe what was changed</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt> <img alt="GoodCommitMessage.png" src="/SiteAssets/do-you-know-when-to-branch-in-git/GoodCommitMessage.png" data-pin-nopin="true" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good Example - Commit message describes exactly what was changed.&#160;<br></dd></dl><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">
   <b>d) Push your changes to your remote Feature Branch </b></p><h3>2) Open a pull request (to merge from your current branch to the master)<br></h3><p>When the change is complete, or when you want feedback on anything, open a pull request to merge the branch back to <strong> master</strong>. The pull request is more than just a request to merge, it is a request to have someone review the code and architecture, and to discuss any issues. &#160;Resolve these issues with more commits in the branch before continuing.</p><p>Tip&#58; A best practice is to have another developer review your work and then approve.<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">It is easy to chalk this step up as busy-work, but it is one of the most valuable parts of the strategy<br></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">#assumption<br></h3><p>Deploy the changes to a staging environment. &#160;This allows the features to be tested before being merged to <strong>master</strong>.</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-InfoBox">Some prefer to move this step&#160;to after the merge, especially when using a release management tool like VSTS Release or Octopus Deploy (see <a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=e2608875-5b0b-4215-bee8-8ffd966dc972">Do you use the best deployment tool</a>). &#160;If you decide to go this route, remember that <strong>master</strong> should remain deployable and production ready at all times and that all branches come from <b> master</b>. &#160;If skipping this step,&#160;ensure that you have CI on your feature&#160;branch to ensure that your branch compiles and passes all tests before merging. <br></p><h3>3) Merge and Deploy (to master)<br></h3><p>Once everyone is happy and everything is tested, complete the pull request, which will merge back to <strong> master</strong>. Ensure you are not using the &quot;Fast Forward&quot; merge option (git), or details about the branch will be lost - it will appear as though all work was done in <strong>master</strong>. Being able to see the feature branches in the git log is very useful.&#160;</p><dl class="goodImage"><dt> <img alt="GoodGitHistory.png" src="/SiteAssets/do-you-know-when-to-branch-in-git/GoodGitHistory.png" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good Example - Each change is well described, small&#160;and in its own feature branch.</dd><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​​​<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">After you completed the pull request, make sure you also delete the branch that you made the pull request of.<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Otherwise, you can do it before you complete the pull request by ticking delete branch option.<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P"><img src="/SiteAssets/do-you-know-when-to-branch-in-git/delete%20branch%20in%20devops.png" alt="delete branch in devops.png" style="margin&#58;5px;" />&#160;</p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">​​Figure&#58; Good Example - Automatically delete the branch after the pull request completion in Azure Devops<br></dd><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​​​​​<img src="/SiteAssets/do-you-know-when-to-branch-in-git/github%20settings.png" alt="github settings.png" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;808px;" /></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">​​Figure&#58; Good Example - Set the whole project to auto-delete branch after merging in GitHub<br></dd><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​<br><br></p></dl><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">Once merged, <b> master</b> should immediately and automatically be deployed (in a perfect world,&#160;to production).</p>
