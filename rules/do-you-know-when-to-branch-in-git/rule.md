The basic idea is to always deploy from <strong> master</strong>, and to create a feature branch for every feature. When the feature is complete, it is merged back to master via a pull request, which provides a trigger for other developers to build.</p><p>Using this strategy, <strong> master </strong>is always production-ready and deployable.</p> </span>

      <strong>It is critical that this branch always comes off master, not another feature branch. Master is the only branch that is mandated to be in a deployable state, so any other option is unsafe.</strong></p><p>Obviously, we're creating a lot of branches and merging a lot under this strategy - and that's ok. &#160;Be sure to keep your PBIs small (as per&#160;<a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=2e446681-6eff-4cec-b955-e530edc4cdc8">do you break large tasks into smaller tasks</a>), and you will not have much merge pain.</p><p>The benefit of creating feature branches is to reduce the amount of conflicts and churn of unfinished code during development of a feature. &#160;It allows features to be development independently of each other, and reduces the amount of expensive &quot;pull latest from server, and rebuild everything&quot; operations, as well as greatly limiting the impact of commits with unfinished code.</p><p><span style="color&#58;#ff0000;">b</span><strong style="color&#58;#ff0000;"><span style="color&#58;#ff0000;">) Code away and complete the PBI</span></strong><br></p><h3><span style="font-size&#58;13px;">c) Create a commit - it will contain your changed files on your local PC&#160;</span></h3><p>While working, commit frequently to this branch with nice, descriptive messages. For example, &quot;Added a field to hold the product category to our timesheet read model&quot; and &quot;added a column to the timesheet summary UI for the product category&quot;.</p><dl class="badImage"><dt> <img alt="git commit -m &quot;Started report change&quot;" src="/PublishingImages/BadCommitMessage.png" data-pin-nopin="true" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Bad Example - Commit message does not describe what was changed</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt> <img alt="GoodCommitMessage.png" src="/SiteAssets/do-you-know-when-to-branch-in-git/GoodCommitMessage.png" data-pin-nopin="true" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good Example - Commit message describes exactly what was changed.&#160;<br></dd></dl><h3><span style="font-size&#58;13px;">d) Push your changes to your remote Feature Branch</span></h3><p><br>&#160;</p><h3>2) Open a pull request (to merge from your current branch to the master).<br><br></h3><p>When the change is complete, or when you want feedback on anything, open a pull request to merge the branch back to <strong> master</strong>. The pull request is more than just a request to merge, it is a request to have someone review the code and architecture, and to discuss any issues. &#160;Resolve these issues with more commits in the branch before continuing.</p><p>Tip&#58; A best practice is to have another developer review your work and then approve.<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">It is easy to chalk this step up as busy-work, but it is one of the most valuable parts of the strategy<br></p><h3>#assumption<br></h3><p>Deploy the changes to a staging environment. &#160;This allows the features to be tested before being merged to <strong>master</strong>.</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-InfoBox">Some prefer to move this step&#160;to after the merge , especially when using a release management tool like VSTS Release or Octopus Deploy (see <a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=e2608875-5b0b-4215-bee8-8ffd966dc972">Do you use the best deployment tool</a>). &#160;If you decide to go this route, remember that <strong>master</strong> should remain deployable and production ready at all times, and that all branches come from <b>master</b>. &#160;If skipping this step,&#160;ensure that you have CI on your feature&#160;branch to ensure that your branch compiles and passes all tests before merging.​<br></p><h3>3) Merge and Deploy (to master)<br></h3><p>Once everyone is happy and everything is tested, complete the pull request, which will merge back to <strong> master</strong>. Ensure you are not using the &quot;Fast Forward&quot; merge option (git), or details about the branch will be lost - it will appear as though all work was done in <strong>master</strong>. Being able to see the feature branches in the git log is very useful.&#160;</p><dl class="goodImage"><dt> <img alt="GoodGitHistory.png" src="/SiteAssets/do-you-know-when-to-branch-in-git/GoodGitHistory.png" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good Example - Each change is well described, small&#160;and in its own feature branch. </dd></dl><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">Once merged, <b>master</b> should immediately and automatically be deployed (in a perfect world,&#160;to production) .</p>
