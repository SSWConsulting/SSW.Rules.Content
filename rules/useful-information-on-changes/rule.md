When creating a Pull Request with your changes, it is important to have a good description that will help the reviewer to understand what was done.

Leaving the description blank is common and not helpful. There are also cases where people overexplain. **You should try to include just the right amount of information.**

Try to make generic comments that objectively summarize your changes. This way the reviewer will know what to expect and confirm the changes by looking at the file diffs.

### Many small changes

You should summarize by saying: _“Improved readability”_ OR _“Fixed typos and grammar”_

### Big and complex changes

You should include a demonstration of the change. E.g. A [screenshot](/screenshots-avoid-walls-of-text) to show text/UI changes, or a [Done video](/record-a-quick-and-dirty-done-video) to demo functionality changes.
