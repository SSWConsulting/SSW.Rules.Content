When a team member leaves (resignation, contract end, internal move, or offboarding initiated by the company) it's respectful and valuable to give them clear, balanced feedback. A short, structured process helps them grow and leaves the door open for future collaboration. **Just as importantly, it shines a light on where the *team* and its onboarding/offboarding processes can improve (e.g. setup friction, missing documentation, slow access).** Treat the departing person as a mirror reflecting your system quality.

## Why have an offboarding feedback session?

* Gives the leaver actionable insights (what to keep doing, what to improve)
* Reinforces a culture of transparency and continuous improvement
* Avoids vague or emotional exit conversations – replaces them with prepared facts
* Helps the remaining team reflect and reset

::: info
**Tip:** Treat offboarding feedback like a mini performance review – focused, factual, and future-oriented.
:::

## Timing

Run the internal prep within 1 business day of formal notice. Deliver the feedback (email + call) no later than 2 business days before their final working day.

## Preparation (Internal Only)

1. Manager books a 20–30 min internal huddle (no leaver present)
2. Ask: "What did <Name> do well?" – collect positives first
3. Then: "Where could <Name> have improved?" – focus on behaviours, outcomes, and patterns
4. Seniors refine wording into neutral, specific, 1‑line bullets
5. Group into 2 sections: "Strengths" and "Opportunities to Improve"
6. Sanity check: Is every item:
   * Specific (observable, not personality labels)
   * Balanced (not all negative)
   * Actionable (they can influence it)

7. Quick team retro (2–3 mins): "What could *we* have done better to support <Name>?" Capture friction points (e.g. slow environment setup, unclear onboarding docs, delayed access requests) into action items.

::: info
**Tip:** Keep the leaver-focused feedback separate from team improvement actions – both are valuable, but they serve different audiences.
:::

::: warning
**Warning:** Exclude anything hearsay-based, confidential (client HR issues), or emotionally charged.
:::

## Delivering the feedback

The delivery has 2 parts:

1. Email (sent shortly before the call) – ensures they can read and absorb
2. Short call (15–20 mins) with Manager + 1–2 Seniors – discusses clarification and next steps

Sequence:

* Send the email (cc: Manager + Seniors)
* Join the call – start with thanks, then walk through strengths first
* Invite questions; don't debate – acknowledge and move on
* Close positively: "We appreciate your contributions and hope this helps you in your next role."

## Suggested email template

Subject: Thank you and feedback – <Name>'s time with <Team/Project>

Hi <Name>,

Thanks for the work you've done on <Project/Client>. As part of our offboarding process we've compiled balanced feedback to support your ongoing growth.

**Strengths**
* <Bullet 1>
* <Bullet 2>

**Opportunities to Improve**
* <Bullet 1>
* <Bullet 2>

If you'd like a brief follow‑up chat after your start in the next role, reach out any time.

All the best,
<Manager Name>
<Title>

::: info
**Tip:** Keep the email concise – elaboration happens in the call.

## Example 1‑liner feedback points

(Replace with team-specific items – keep neutral and factual.)

**Strengths**
* Proactively picked up unassigned bugs without prompting
* Built strong rapport with the client product owner
* Documented deployment steps clearly in the runbook

**Opportunities to Improve**
* Standups often ran long – answers sometimes included unnecessary detail
* Pull Requests occasionally lacked context in the description
* Missed 2 sprint retros – need more consistent participation in team ceremonies
* Estimates sometimes optimistic – consider padding for unknown integration work

## Team improvement actions (internal)

Offboarding isn’t only about the person leaving – it’s a chance to spot where the team or onboarding process fell short.

During the internal huddle, list any friction the leaver experienced and turn each into a concrete improvement (a PBI or task). Aim for at least one improvement item.

**Examples**
* Dev environment setup required 3 days – create a self-serve onboarding checklist and automate script
* Access to logging tools took a week – streamline the access request via an internal form
* Onboarding docs missed API version dependencies – update the runbook and add a validation step
* No scheduled pairing in first sprint – add a pairing rota for new starters
* Unclear code style expectations – link coding standards in the onboarding email

**Action pattern**
Friction → Root cause → Improvement task → Owner → Due date

::: ok
Figure: Good example – Turning setup pain into a tracked improvement task avoids repeating the problem for the next hire
:::

::: warning
**Warning:** Don’t include team shortcomings in the leaver’s email – keep the tone focused on their growth, not internal issues.

## Do / Don't

| Do | Don't |
| --- | --- |
| Lead with positives | Surprise them with new criticism in the call |
| Use "You did X" not personality labels | Use vague terms like "bad attitude" |
| Focus on behaviours and outcomes | Include gossip or third‑hand complaints |
| Keep bullets short and scannable | Send walls of text |
| Offer a future support option | Make promises you can't keep |

## Ownership

* Manager: Schedules huddle + sends email
* Seniors: Curate and phrase feedback
* Team: Contributes raw points

## Quality checklist before sending

* Balanced (≥1 strength for every improvement area)
* No confidential or HR-only content
* No unexplained acronyms
* Bullets ≤ 20 words each
* Tone: Professional, respectful, future-focused

## Common mistakes to avoid

* Waiting until the last day – rushed and low impact
* Only verbal feedback – easily forgotten
* Emotional venting – erodes trust
* Being overly generic – "communication" without examples

## FAQ

**Q: What if there's serious misconduct?**
Handle via HR – keep this process for professional growth feedback only.

**Q: What if they disagree?**
Acknowledge their view: "Thanks – we'll note that." Do not debate point-by-point.

**Q: Do we offboard internal transfers?**
Yes – still provide feedback; it helps their next team.

**Note:** A great offboarding experience increases the chance of future re-engagement or referrals.
