<p>Clients love Done Videos. Done V​ideos offer transparency, visibility, testing, and early releasing of a feature they might otherwise have to wait weeks or months to see released. The video&#160;lets them see the new feature and enables early feedback, which is beneficial to&#160;both the developer and the client.&#160;<br></p><p>The best way to demonstrate that a new piece of functionality is working is to record yourself using it successfully. this works as both a demo, as well as a training aid if they need to reference it again later.​​<br><br></p><div class="ms-rtestate-read ms-rte-embedcode ms-rte-embedil ms-rtestate-notify">
