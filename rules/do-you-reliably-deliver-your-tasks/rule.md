Some tasks are either time-critical or you give a promise to do them promptly. It's very important that these tasks are given a high priority.

If you're not going to be able to deliver a task on-time, you should let the appropriate people know right away.

You could use your Inbox as a priority list by [sending yourself emails](/send-to-myself-emails) with an estimate and the priority. Remember to Cc others who should know about the task, so that they could easily know what is going on and give advice/feedback.
