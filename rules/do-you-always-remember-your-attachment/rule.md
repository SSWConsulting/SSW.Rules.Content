When you refer to an attachment in your email, don't forget to include the attachment. I always attach the files first before I write my message. 

<!--endintro-->


We have a program called [SSW LookOut! for Outlook](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/LookOut/) to check for this rule. 

![SSW LookOut](../../assets/ContactorAttached.gif)! for Outlook automatically warns you if you have forgotten to include your attachments.**
