<span class='intro'> 
  <br>
When you refer to an attachment in your email, don't forget to include the attachment. I always attach the files first before I write my message. <br>
 </span>


  <br>
  <div class="ms-rteCustom-YellowBorderBox">We have a program called <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/LookOut/">SSW LookOut! for Outlook</a> to check for this rule. <br>
<img class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" alt="Contact or attached" src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/ContactorAttached.gif" /> <span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; SSW LookOut! for Outlook automatically warns you if you have forgotten to include your attachments. </span></div>
