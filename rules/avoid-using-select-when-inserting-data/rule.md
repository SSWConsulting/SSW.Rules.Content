Using a statement like "INSERT tableName SELECT \* FROM otherTable", makes your stored procedures vulnerable to failure. Once either of the two tables change, your stored procedure won't work. Not only that, when the inserting table has an identity column, such a statement will cause an error - "An explicit value for the identity column in table ParaRight can only be specified when a column list is used and IDENTITY\_INSERT is ON."

```
USE [ParaGreg]
GO
/****** Object: StoredProcedure [dbo].[procMove] Script Date: 08/08/2008 12:18:33 ******/
SET ANSI_NULLS ON
GO
SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON
GO
ALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[procMove]
@id AS Char,
@direction AS INT
AS
IF @direction = 0
BEGIN
 INSERT INTO ParaRight
 SELECT * FROM ParaLeft
 WHERE ParaID = @id
 DELETE FROM ParaLeft
 WHERE ParaID = @id
END
ELSE IF @direction = 1
BEGIN
 INSERT INTO ParaLeft
 SELECT * FROM ParaRight
 WHERE ParaID = @id
 DELETE FROM ParaRight
 WHERE ParaID = @id
END
```
