This rule is a variation of the popular rule [Do you send "As Per Our Conversation" emails?](/as-per-our-conversation-emails)

The most dangerous time in a task's life cycle is in a handover. This is the most likely time for a misunderstanding to occur leading to a task getting lost and not being completed.

<!--endintro-->
 Always make sure you clearly reallocate a task with an email to the person who will complete the task like the good example below: 
 
::: email-template  
|          |     |
| -------- | --- |
| To:      | Bob |
| Cc:      | Sergei |
| Subject: | RE: Northwind app |  
::: email-content  

### Hi Bob,

I already talked with Sergei, he will handle it.
