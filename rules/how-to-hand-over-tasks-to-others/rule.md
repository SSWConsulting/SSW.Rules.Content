The most dangerous time in a task's life cycle is in handover. This is the most likely time for a misunderstanding to occur leading to a task getting lost and not being completed.<br>

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
Always make sure you clearly reallocate a task with an email like the good example below&#58; <br>
