This rule is a variation of the popular rule [Do you send "As Per Our Conversation" emails?](/as-per-our-conversation-emails)

The most dangerous time in a task's life cycle is in a handover. This is the most likely time for a misunderstanding to occur leading to a task getting lost and not being completed.

<!--endintro-->
 Always make sure you clearly reallocate a task with an email to the person who will complete the task like the good example below: 
 
::: email-template  
|          |     |
| -------- | --- |
| To:      | Bob |
| Cc:      | Sergei |
| Subject: | RE: Northwind app |  
::: email-content  

### Hi Bob,

I already talked with Sergei, he will handle it.

If you are handing over an employee responsibility, if you use an intranet, you should always include a link to the employee responsibility and then copy the important stuff into an email as an 'as per our conversation.'

::: email-content  

### Hi Sergei,

As per our conversation this responsibility is now yours: [SSW.Admin - Scheduling .NET User Groups handover](https://sswcom.sharepoint.com/Lists/ProductManagers/DispForm.aspx?ID=728&Source=https%3A%2F%2Fsswcom%2Esharepoint%2Ecom%2FLists%2FProductManagers%2FGroupByEmployeeName%2Easpx%3Fviewid%3D92c9dd60%252D2154%252D49f9%252Dba56%252D3a6dd7e80560%26useFiltersInViewXml%3D1%26FilterField1%3DProduct%255Fx0020%255FManager%26FilterValue1%3DPenny%2520Walker%2520%255BSSW%255D%26FilterType1%3DUser%26FilterOp1%3DIn&ContentTypeId=0x0100F16D27136EE9EE498512BE316A398840&RootFolder=%2FLists%2FProductManagers) (Pasted below)

As discussed, you need to:
	
* ​​​Always have a few months' worth of user groups scheduled ahead of time.

* NB: Check if user group dates fall on a public holiday. If they do, contact venue (Canberra user group) or check SSW Chapel (Sydney user group) to reschedule to the next available week day. 

Regards,
Andy
