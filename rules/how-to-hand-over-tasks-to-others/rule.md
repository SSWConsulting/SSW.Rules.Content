This rule is a variation of the popular rule [Do you send "As Per Our Conversation" emails?](/as-per-our-conversation-emails)

The most dangerous time in a task's life cycle is in a handover. This is the most likely time for a misunderstanding to occur leading to a task getting lost and not being completed.

<!--endintro-->
 Always make sure you clearly reallocate a task with an email to the person who will complete the task like the good example below: 
 
::: email-template  
|          |     |
| -------- | --- |
| To:      | Bob |
| Cc:      | Sergei |
| Subject: | RE: Northwind app |  
::: email-content  

### Hi Bob,

I already talked with Sergei, he will handle it.

To: Andy
Subject: Northwind app

### Hi Andy,

As per our conversation yesterday about Northwind app, it keeps crashing when I do a search under 'Company',

If you are handing over an employee responsibility, if you use an intranet, you should always include a link to the employee responsibility and then copy the important stuff into an email as an 'as per our conversation.'

::: email-template  
|          |     |
| -------- | --- |
| To:      | Sergei |
| Cc:      | Bob |
| Subject: | RE: SSW.Admin - Scheduling .NET User Groups handover |  
::: email-content  

### Hi Sergei,

As per our conversation this responsibility is now yours: <Embedded Link to SSW.Admin - Scheduling .NET User Groups handover> (Pasted below)

As discussed, you need to:
	
* Always have a few months' worth of user groups scheduled ahead of time.

* NB: Check if user group dates fall on a public holiday. If they do, contact venue (Canberra user group) or check SSW Chapel (Sydney user group) to reschedule to the next available week day. 

Regards,
Andy
