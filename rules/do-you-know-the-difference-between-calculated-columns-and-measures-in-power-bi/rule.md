When you run into a wall in Power BI and feel like you've exhausted the out of the box functionality, that when it's time to investigate what a bit of DAX can do for you. 

<!--endintro-->

There are 2 different things you can do with DAX, create a Measure or a Calculated Column.

Calculated columns:

* Stored in the database
* Often used to filter/group data




Measures:



* Computed on aggregates of values
* Computed at query time
* Often used to give a numerical metric







```
GroupingColumn = if(value<x, small, if(value<y, medium, large))
```
