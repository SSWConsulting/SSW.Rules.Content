Recording a video is time-consuming... scripting, filming, editing, and reviewing all take effort. The biggest waste happens when you record **before** verifying the accuracy of your content.  

Before hitting record, a quick **content check** can save hours of rework and help you get it right the first time.

## The problem

You’ve recorded a video, and once it’s ready for edit, someone notices inaccurate content, missing context, or off-brand messaging. Now you need to re-record... wasting time and effort.

## The solution

Before you hit record, ask for a content check with a **Subject Matter Expert (SME)** or the **TV/Production Team**.

Think of it as the “[Checked by xxx](/checked-by-xxx/)” rule for your video content.

### Steps for a public video recording

1. **Prepare yourself**  

   * Write your talking points, slides, or short script
   * Know the key message you want to deliver

2. **Get a content check and ask for feedback**  

   * Send your draft or slides
   * Let the reviewer mark it as **Checked by {{ NAME }}**

    * If it’s a **technical/development topic**, get a **Dev SME** to review
    * If it’s a **production, marketing, or client-facing topic**, get a **TV/Production Team** member

    **Note:** Sometimes, it’s both!

3. **(Optional) Perform presentation/video in full over a call or in person**  

   * Setup a time with them to perform your presentation/video in full over a call or in person. This way, you're getting rapid feedback in a 1 on 1 way. Saving you loads of time later down the line.

4. **Apply suggestions**  

   * Update your outline before filming
   * You’ve passed the content check ✅

5. **Record with confidence**  

   * Hit "Record" and share your wonderful knowledge
