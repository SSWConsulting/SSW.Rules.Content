<span class='intro'> <p>​
                    Each team member has their own set of skills. There is no use hiding those skills
                    &quot;under a bushel&quot;. If you can at least share one idea a week the team's shared knowledge
                    increases. This has many positive spin-offs, for example, the teams don't become
                    reliant upon one individual, and when your idea is adopted your confidence increases
                    allowing you to make more contributions in the future. Importantly, it's not only
                    management that should contribute this way. Everyone has something to share.</p> </span>

                    As an example, if you have a handy tip, send an email to your team or add it
                    to the KB.
