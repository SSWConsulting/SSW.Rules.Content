Sometimes it's difficult for product owners to gauge how bad a problem really is just from words, especially if they're not technical. 

A product owner usually has many things going on at any given time and can sometimes struggle to understand the severity of a problem or see it at it's core.

Luckily, there are a few things we can do to help demonstrate these issues.

- **Visually demonstrate the problem** - Showing the problem visually can help demonstrate how bad a problem is and how it could affect clients or users.
- **Ask for the product owners undivided attention** - Sometimes a product owner has something else going on in their mind and is not putting the required thought and attention into the problem. Asking for the product owners full attention and letting them know it's important can help them recontextualize and focus more on the issue.
