<span class='intro'> ​Scrum processes are&#160;useful&#160;for more than just software development - it’s a great tool for organizing and optimizing all kinds of work, from presentations to meetings to events, sales, and more. The guys at SSW jokingly say, &quot;you can't eat dinner with Adam Cogan without a retro about the meal&quot;.<div><br></div><div>You should get into the practice of having a retro for most tasks. It’s a great way to get feedback while it’s still fresh in people’s minds, and it lets you know what you need to change to be even more successful next time.<br></div><div><br></div> </span>

<h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Get it in their mind at the kick-off​<br></h3><p>Let everyone know from the start that we do a “retro”, and what it entails (see the rule,&#160;<a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=4f02d28d-5375-4530-abcb-0b541683bcbc">Do you know what happens during a Sprint Retrospective Meeting?</a>). This way, they will know to be mindful during the event/task/presentation and maybe even take notes.<br>Then at the end, remind people, “In the spirit of Scrum, let’s do a retro.”<br>&#160;<br></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">The 3 questions​</h3><p>Start with “What went well?” - everyone must say one thing.<br>Then move onto, “What didn’t go so well?” This part can be painful but it’s important - we need to know these things so that we can make improvements.<br>Finally, we ask, “What could we do differently next time?”<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox"><b>Adam&#58;</b> How was the presentation?<br><b>Eddie&#58;</b> Yeah, it was alright.</p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad">Bad example&#58; This line of questioning doesn’t provide useful feedback​<br></dd><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox"><b>Adam&#58;</b> What went well with your presentation?<br><b>Eddie&#58; </b>People seemed to really relate to the case studies I presented.<br><b>Adam&#58; </b>What didn’t go so well?<br><b>Eddie&#58; </b>My demo didn’t work. That was really embarrassing.<br><b>Adam&#58;</b> What would you do differently next time?<br><b>Eddie&#58;</b> I’d definitely get there a bit earlier so I’d have time to troubleshoot that pesky demo on their wifi! That would also give me extra time to talk to the audience so I could find out what problems they’re hoping to solve with my session - it’s a good way to get more case studies!</p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Good example&#58; The 3 magic questions got a lot more detail and the beginnings of a plan for next time​<br><br></dd>
