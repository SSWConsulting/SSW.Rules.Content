<span class='intro'> <p>​
                    Every website out there has a page which displays the results of a search. I am
                    amazed that no standard has been adopted throughout the Web as nearly every site
                    seems to have a different way of displaying data.</p> </span>

<p>
                    However, Google is a very good example for displaying search results. Their result
                    pages are clear and efficient, especially for a large result set.
                </p><dl class="image"><dt>
                        <img src="/WebSites/RulesToBetterWebsitesLayout/PublishingImages/results-ssw.jpg" alt="Google result" /></dt><dd>
                        Figure&#58; Good example – adopt <a href="http&#58;//www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=ssw&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=">Google's search result layout</a>  </dd></dl><p>                    
                So adopt Google's search result layout and it will give new and regular users a better navigation experience.
                Here's our standard layout for our search function.
                </p><p>Want the 'Google grid'? Then follow these rules to help users to navigate&#58;
                    </p><ol><li>Filters at the top (if more than one search parameter,then add a &quot;search&quot; button)</li><li>The number of results found + how many seconds the search took to execute</li><li>A statement that explains the criteria that you used for searching (or keep the criteria in the text box like google does)</li><li>The number of pages found (hyperlinks centered in the middle), and these hyperlinks
                        should be shown on the footer of the page only.</li></ol><dl class="image"><dt>
                        <img src="/WebSites/RulesToBetterWebsitesLayout/PublishingImages/results-filter.jpg" alt="Result Pages" /></dt><dd>
                        Figure&#58; The header of <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Products/ProdCategoryList.aspx">SSW results screen
                        </a>- filter, number of results found, search criteria and time taken</dd></dl><dl class="image"><dt>
                        <img src="/WebSites/RulesToBetterWebsitesLayout/PublishingImages/results-pagination.jpg" alt="Result Pages" /></dt><dd>
                        Figure&#58; Good example - The footer of <a href="/ssw/Products/ProdCategory.aspx?CategoryID=CODAUD">SSW product order listing page</a>
                        has the hyperlinks for pages 1 to 10 centered</dd></dl><dl class="image"><dt>

                        Figure&#58; Google's classic search results</dd></dl>
