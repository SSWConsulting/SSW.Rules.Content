Do you know how to run effective meetings?

<!--endintro-->

1. Work out if a meeting is even necessary. Some things are just not a good use of group time. E.g. feedback on a doc is probably better done offline. On the flip side, if something is sensitive and requires a lot of back and forth, that is a great use for a meeting.
2. Ensure only the Key people are invited to the meeting - meetings are resource intensive and take up a lot of time. Look at it like this, if you have 5 people in a 1-hour meeting that is a waste of time, you haven’t lost 1-hour, you’ve lost 5-man hours. Where you can, only invite delegates.
3. Set an objective and the agenda for the meeting. Be clear what you would like to achieve and communicate that. You don’t have to do a written agenda for short meeting, but anything 1-hour or over an agenda is essential and it should be sent before the meeting for people to see.
4. The Meeting starts the minute the invite is sent, not when it physically starts. For example if you need feedback on a large document, you can give people advanced warning that you will be taking their feedback during the meeting, and they need to review it ahead of time.
5. “Prewire” meetings with important topics. To get alignment or collaboration on something sensitive , you don’t want surprises. Try to do a check-in or have a corridor conversation beforehand to preview the topic and get their thoughts on it.
6. Actively Manage your meetings. Event with an agenda, you need to make sure you stay on track. Obviously you don’t want to break flow, but you also don’t want to diverge from your important topics. Capture it, and park it for another discussion. It’s ok to politely interrupt and redirect the conversation.
7. Agree on the next steps that need to be taken and document them. Send a summary and list the action items. For Scrum Teams, this should go into a backlog. It makes the meeting actionable and productive.
