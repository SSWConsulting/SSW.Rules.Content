Meetings can be good for the few and unproductive for the many.

A meeting can be useful  if it meets these three criteria: 

<!--endintro-->

* [You know what you're going to do in it](/share-the-agenda)
* [You do the thing](/stick-to-the-agenda-and-complete-the-meetings-goal)
* At the end, somebody [emails the summary reports out](/share-the-action-items-that-came-up):  
  _‘OK, we’re all going to do these things going forward.’_
