Meetings are not necessarily traps to lure the work force into complacency while enabling managers to appear busy. 

A meeting can be useful (or even good) if it meets these three criteria: 
* You know what you’re going to do in it (link)
* You do the thing (link)
* At the end, somebody reports out: ‘OK, we’re all going to do these things going forward.’ (link)
