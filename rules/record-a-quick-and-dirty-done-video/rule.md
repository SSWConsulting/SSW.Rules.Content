When you've finished a PBI you should record a video to send to your Product Owner and anyone else that is interested. A 'Done' video is much better than a screenshot because you are proving the PBI workflow actually works. Even better, this video can double as documentation or release notes for your users.

<!--endintro-->

When deciding whether a PBI might be a good contender to record a done video for, consider these factors:

1. Is it a key piece of functionality that has high business value?
2. Would it be difficult to quickly demo in the Sprint Review without a video?
3. Is it UI heavy? i.e. would the video be compelling?

**Choosing software to record your screen and camera together:**

* Remote recordings: Zoom, or Microsoft Teams via NDI 
* Basic recordings: Snagit, Loom
* Advanced recordings: Camtasia

**Tip:** [Camtasia 2021](https://www.techsmith.com/camtasia-2021-press-release.html) is recommended because it vastly improves upon 2018 and 2019. 

**Tip:** Both Zoom and Microsoft Teams are Cloud services, so consider whether an option such as Camtasia that records locally is more appropriate.

**Choosing software to edit your video:**

* Basic editing: Camtasia
* Advanced editing: Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut, DaVinci Resolve

Here's a quick video describing how to record and edit a quick done video. (Notice how it itself is also in the done video format?)

**Figure: How to make a 'Done Video'.** 

### For a great 'Done Video' here are the key things to remember:

* Introduce the video - start with “Hi everyone, today I would like to show you xxxx”.
* Show the pain - don't just demonstrate your new feature, start by showing the problem you are solving and why you needed to add the feature.
* Record it in one take - it doesn't matter if you stuff up or something goes wrong, treat it like you're having a conversation with them in the room. If it's super bad, just start again.
* Make it quick and easy - if you spend too much time, you will be less likely to want to do it again in the future.
* Be quick and concise - you don't want to waste other peoples' time either!
* Use a clean browser - hide visible bookmark bars, browser tabs, add-in icons, and taskbar items to make it easier to view. 

  * **Tip:** In Chrome you can use the "guest" profile to open a clean window with no history or cookies.
* Set your screen resolution to 1080p (1920x1080) - higher resolutions (e.g. 4k/3840x2160) will scale down graphic elements and make it harder to view.                  
* Zoom in to 125% in your browser - as per: [Do you make sure your screen recordings are easy to view?](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/easy-to-view-screen-recordings)
* Record both your screen and webcam - PC and Mac can both use Camtasia (2021 version recommended). For Mac you can use Quicktime, but it’s not as flexible. Zoom and Teams record both by default.

  * **Tip:** If you're using Zoom, turn on HD recording (720p or 1080p depending on your plan) in Settings | Video | Camera | HD.
* Don't edit the video - your introduction and closing should have your webcam on full-screen, and the rest of the video should be your screen with your webcam in the corner (also called a picture-in-picture, or PiP).

  * **Tip:** If you are using Zoom you do not need to edit the video. Zoom includes your face automatically in the screen capture. Awesome!
* [Check your audio devices](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/record-better-audio) - if you have multiple microphones (e.g. headphone/mic set, webcam mic, inbuilt mic, etc.) do a test recording to see which is the best quality.

  * **Tip:** You can use the default Voice Recorder app on either Windows or Mac to quickly record audio.
* Audio needs to be clear and not distracting - if there are lots of background noises it will prevent audiences from focusing on you, as per: [Do you record better audio?](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/record-better-audio)
* Interact with your webcam like it's a person - look into the camera and smile when doing your introduction and closing for the video!

**Tip:** Some offices have a professional setup:

  E.g. SSW have the **Marantz Turret** hardware and desktop recording kit. The Turret is an ideal device to record these videos as it has a professional podcasting microphone, built-in light and good quality High Definition video camera.

### Tip #2: Camtasia - Fix the audio before making any cuts to the video

After recording your video, you need to do some basic sound processing to make the audio awesome.

* In the Timeline, select the clip with the audio
* On the top left panel, click ‘Audio Effects’ and drag the ‘Levelling’ effect onto your clip
* On the timeline, move the new audio meter up just until the audio waveform is about to hit the top
* Listen and adjust as necessary

### Tip #3: Camtasia 9 - Fade-out and fade-in the video track of your face

1. With the video track of your face selected, click on  **Animations (1)** . Track 3 in the image below.
2. Select the  **No Opacity (2)** animation effect for the fade-out.
3. **Drag and drop the No Opacity effect (3)** to the point in the track where you want to fade-out. Adjust the start and end point of the fade using the handles on the animation arrow.
4. Select the  **Full Opacity (4)** animation effect for fade-in.
5. **Drag and drop the Full Opacity effect (5)** to the point in the track where you want to fade-in. Adjust the start  and end point of the fade using the handles on the animation arrow.
