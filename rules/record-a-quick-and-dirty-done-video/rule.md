When you've finished a PBI you should record a video to send to your Product Owner and anyone else that is interested. A 'Done' video is much better than a screenshot because you are proving the PBI workflow actually works. Even better, this video can double as documentation or release notes for your users.

<!--endintro-->

When deciding whether a PBI might be a good contender to record a Done video for, consider these factors:

1. Is it a key piece of functionality that has high business value?
2. Would it be difficult to quickly demo in the Sprint Review without a video?
3. Is it UI heavy? i.e. Would the video be compelling?

**Choosing software to record your screen and camera together:**

* Remote recordings: [Zoom](https://zoom.us), [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-teams) via [NDI](https://www.ndi.tv),  [StreamYard](https://streamyard.com) (advanced)
* Basic recordings: [Snagit](https://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.html), [Loom](https://www.loom.com),
* Advanced recordings: [Clipchamp](https://clipchamp.com/en/), [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com), [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/store/camtasia),

**Tip #1:** Clipchamp is recommended because it is easy to use both for recording and editing, completely free, and offer direct uploads to YouTube.

**Tip #2:** Zoom, and Microsoft Teams are cloud-based services, so consider whether an option such as Snagit, Loom or Clipchamp that records locally is more appropriate. **If you record with Zoom, post-production editing will be required**. 


**Choosing software to edit your video:**

* Basic editing: Video Editor (for Windows), iMovie (for Mac)
* Advanced editing: Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut, DaVinci Resolve

#### Tip #2: Camtasia - Fix the audio before making any cuts to the video

After recording your video, you need to do some basic sound processing to make the audio awesome.

* In the Timeline, select the clip with the audio
* On the top left panel, click ‘Audio Effects’ and drag the ‘Levelling’ effect onto your clip
* On the timeline, move the new audio meter up just until the audio waveform is about to hit the top
* Listen and adjust as necessary
