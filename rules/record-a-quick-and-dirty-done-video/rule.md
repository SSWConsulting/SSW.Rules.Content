When you've finished a PBI you should record a video to send to your Product Owner and anyone else that is interested. A 'Done' video is much better than a screenshot because you are proving the PBI workflow actually works. Even better, this video can double as documentation or release notes for your users.

<!--endintro-->

When deciding whether a PBI might be a good contender to record a Done Video for, consider these factors:

1. Is it a key piece of functionality that has high business value?
2. Would it be difficult to quickly demo in the Sprint Review without a video?
3. Is it UI heavy? i.e. Would the video be compelling?

**Choosing software to record your screen and camera together:**

Check out SSW Rule [Do you know how to record your screen?](/recording-screen) for the best options.

**Choosing software to edit your video:**

* Basic editing: Clipchamp, Video Editor (for Windows), iMovie (for Mac)
* Advanced editing: Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut, DaVinci Resolve

### For a quick and dirty 'Done Video'

Your done videos should follow the following format

1. **Intro**
   * Fade in to a medium close up shot of yourself
   * Start with a smile the camera for 2 seconds before speaking
   * Briefly introduce yourself e.g. first name, role, "from SSW"
2. **Post-intro**
    * Transition into a screen share with the solution you've created on screen, moving your portrait shot to the bottom right corner of the screen
    * Provide an overview of the PBI you are going to discuss, remembering to zoom out before showing code samples or demos (see rule - [Do you zoom out then in](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/zooming-in-and-out/))
    * You should start with the tabs you are planning to use open
2. **Show the Pain**
   * Explain the problem you or the stakeholder was having before you finished your work
   * Show a example of where this issue occurred
3. **Demo the solution**
   * Provide a working example of your code
   * You should try to demo the code with a realistic use case rather than showing the code itself
   * Harken back to the pain you alluded to earlier to remind the audience you've solved the problem
4. **Outro**
   * Transition back into a medium close up shot of yourself
   * Provide a brief summary of what you discussed in the video
   * Use a signature to bid farewell to the audience (e.g. you could say "This is Bob Northwind signing off")
   * Hold eye contact and a smile to the camera for 2 seconds before the video ends
