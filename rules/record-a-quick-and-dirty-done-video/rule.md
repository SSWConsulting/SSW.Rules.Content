When you've finished a PBI you should record a video to send to your Product Owner and anyone else that is interested. A 'Done' video is much better than a screenshot because you are proving the PBI workflow actually works. Even better, this video can double as documentation or release notes for your users.

<!--endintro-->

When deciding whether a PBI might be a good contender to record a Done video for, consider these factors:

1. Is it a key piece of functionality that has high business value?
2. Would it be difficult to quickly demo in the Sprint Review without a video?
3. Is it UI heavy? i.e. Would the video be compelling?

**Choosing software to record your screen and camera together:**

* Remote recordings: [Zoom](https://zoom.us), [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-teams) via [NDI](https://www.ndi.tv),  [StreamYard](https://streamyard.com) (advanced)
* Basic recordings: [Snagit](https://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.html), [Loom](https://www.loom.com)
* Advanced recordings: [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com), [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/store/camtasia),

**Tip #1:** Zoom, and Microsoft Teams are cloud based services, so consider whether an option such as Snagit or Loom that records locally is more appropriate. **If you record with Zoom, post-production editing will be required**. 

**Tip #2:** OBS is recommended because it is open-source and completely free. 

**Choosing software to edit your video:**

* Basic editing: Video Editor (for Windows), iMovie (for Mac)
* Advanced editing: Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut, DaVinci Resolve

**Video: Make a Quick and Dirty "Done" video in Camtasia (2 min)** 

### For a great 'Done Video' here are the key things to remember:

* Make sure that what you record is generic enough for the world - Watch some [SugarLearning "Done" videos](https://www.youtube.com/@sswsugarlearning500/videos) to get an idea of what it should look like
* Get ready - Prepare yourself and plan what you are going to say. Remember to always give context. Open the browser tabs you are going to show beforehand 
* Introduce the video - Start with "Hi everyone, today I would like to show you..." - Watch the first & last 10 secs of [SugarLearning - Public Search Function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jrrrfcPJEc) to get an idea of what it should look like

  **Note:** Say the same thing again at the end of the video as a summary. E.g. *"Today, I showed you..."*
* Show the pain - Don't just demonstrate your new feature, start by showing the problem you are solving and why you needed to add the feature
* Record it in one take - It doesn't matter if you stuff up or something goes wrong, treat it like you're having a conversation with them in the room. If it's super bad, just start again
* Make it quick and easy - If you spend too much time, you will be less likely to want to do it again in the future
* Be quick and concise - You don't want to waste other people's time either!
* Give people an idea of where to look - E.g. *"I am going to go to the top of the screen... and I’ll hit refresh a number of times"*
* Browser - Use a clean browser - Hide visible bookmark bars, browser tabs, add-in icons, and taskbar items to make it easier to view
    **Tip:** In Chrome you can use the "guest" profile to open a clean window with no history or cookies
* Browser - Zoom in to 125% in your browser - as per: [Do you make sure your screen recordings are easy to view?](/easy-to-view-screen-recordings)
* IDE - Hide any windows not needed in the video (Output, Terminal...)
* Explaining - Make sure you start at a macro zoom level and slowly zoom in as per the rule [Explaining Problems - Do you zoom in and out?](/zooming-in-and-out)
* Set your screen resolution to 1080p (1920x1080) - Higher resolutions (e.g. 4k/3840x2160) will scale down graphic elements and make it harder to view                  
* Record both your screen and webcam - PC and Mac can both use Camtasia (2021 version recommended). For Mac you can use Quicktime, but it’s not as flexible. Zoom and Teams record both by default\
    **Tip:** If you're using Zoom, turn on HD recording (720p or 1080p depending on your plan) in Settings | Video | Camera | HD
* Don't edit the video - Your introduction and closing should have your webcam on full-screen, and the rest of the video should be your screen with your webcam in the corner (also called a picture-in-picture, or PiP)\
    **Tip:** If you are using Zoom you do not need to edit the video. Zoom includes your face automatically in the screen capture. Awesome!
* Check your audio devices - If you have multiple microphones (e.g. headphone/mic set, webcam mic, inbuilt mic, etc.) do a test recording to see which is the best quality\
    **Tip:** You can use the default Voice Recorder app on either Windows or Mac to quickly record audio
* Audio needs to be clear and not distracting - If there are lots of background noises it will prevent audiences from focusing on you. Check [Do you record better audio?](/record-better-audio)
* Interact with your webcam like it's a person - Look into the camera and smile when doing your introduction and closing for the video!

::: info
Some offices have a professional setup.

E.g. SSW have the **Marantz Turret** hardware and desktop recording kit. The Turret is an ideal device to record these videos as it has a professional podcasting microphone, built-in light and good quality High Definition video camera.

**Video: SSW TimePRO - Power BI Ad-Hoc Reporting (4 min)** 

#### Tip #2: Camtasia - Fix the audio before making any cuts to the video

After recording your video, you need to do some basic sound processing to make the audio awesome.

* In the Timeline, select the clip with the audio
* On the top left panel, click ‘Audio Effects’ and drag the ‘Levelling’ effect onto your clip
* On the timeline, move the new audio meter up just until the audio waveform is about to hit the top
* Listen and adjust as necessary

1. With the video track of your face selected, click on **Animations (1)**. Track 3 in the image below.
2. Select the  **No Opacity (2)** animation effect for the fade-out.

4. Select the  **Full Opacity (4)** animation effect for fade-in.
5. **Drag and drop the Full Opacity effect (5)** to the point in the track where you want to fade-in. Adjust the start and end point of the fade using the handles on the animation arrow.
