When you've finished a PBI you should record a video to send to your Product Owner and anyone else that is interested. A 'Done' video is much better than a screenshot because you are proving the PBI workflow actually works. Even better, this video can double as documentation or release notes for your users.

<!--endintro-->

When deciding whether a PBI might be a good contender to record a done video for, consider these factors:

1. Is it a key piece of functionality that has high business value?
2. Would it be difficult to quickly demo in the Sprint Review without a video?
3. Is it UI heavy? i.e. would the video be compelling?

When deciding on the software:

1. Solo "Done Video" – Camtasia
2. Remote person – Zoom or Teams (bitrate is low – the sound is not as good as Camtasia)
3. Edit the Video – Camtasia or Adobe Premiere Pro


Here's a quick video describing how to record and edit a quick done video. (Notice how it itself is also in the done video format?)

**For a great 'Done Video' here are the key things to remember:
** 

* Start with “Hi everyone, today I would like to show you xxxx”
* Don't just demonstrate your new feature, start by showing the problem you are solving and the pain of why you needed to add the feature
* Record it in one take. It doesn't matter if you stuff up or something goes wrong, treat it like you're having a conversation with them in the room. If it's super bad, just start again.
* It's supposed to be quick and easy to make. If you spend too much time, you will be less likely to want to do it again in the future.
* Be quick and concise, you don't want to waste other peoples' time either!
* In your browser, remember to hide visible bookmark bars, browser tabs, add-in icons, and taskbar items to make it easier to view. 
                  
See Rule: [Do you make sure your screen recordings are easy to view?](/easy-to-view-screen-recordings)
* In your browser, such as Chrome then you should first zoom to 125% ideally. 
                  
See Rule: [Do you always zoom in when using a projector?](/meetings-do-you-always-zoom-in-when-using-a-projector) (or in this case before the recording a 'Done' video)
* Set your screen resolution to 1080p (1920x1080).
* Use Camtasia to record your screen and webcam (PC and Mac). For Mac you can use Quicktime but it’s not as flexible.
* Don't edit the video, Don't edit the video, just include your face at the beginning and end, using the fading functionality.
**Tip:** If you are using Zoom you do not need to edit the video. Zoom includes your face automatically in the screen capture. Awesome!
* Do not use headphone and mic combo sets as these are not as good as your webcam's microphone
* **Remember** : smile at the beginning and end of the video!
    
    **Tip:** Some offices have a professional setup.
E.g. SSW have the                  **Marantz Turret** hardware and desktop recording kit. The Turret is an ideal device to record these videos as it has a professional podcasting microphone, built-in light and good quality High Definition video camera.

### Tip: Fix the audio before making any cuts to the video

    After recording your video, you need to do some basic sound processing to make the audio awesome.
    * In the Timeline, select the clip with the audio
    * On the top left panel, click ‘Audio Effects’ and drag the ‘Levelling’ effect onto your clip
    * On the timeline, move the new audio meter up just until the audio waveform is about to hit the top
    * Listen and adjust as necessary
