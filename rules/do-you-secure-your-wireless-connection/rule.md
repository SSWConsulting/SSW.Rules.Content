<span class='intro'> <p>Wireless networks are everywhere now. You can't drive down the street without finding a network which is&#160;insecure. However, in an office&#160;environment, there is a lot more to lose than a bit of bandwidth. It is vital that wireless is kept secure.​<br><br></p> </span>

<p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">WEP, No SSID broadcast, allowed MAC addresses are all OK but these are more home security.</p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad">Figure&#58; Bad example - the above settings are not suitable for a company's wireless access point<br></dd><div> 
   <br> 
</div><p>For the office, you need something a bit more robust and not requiring much management overhead. <br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">It is recommended to use Radius authentication to integrate with your Active Directory.<br></p><div><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Figure&#58; Good example - configure your wireless access point to authenticate against AD</dd><p>This article explains how to setup your wireless AP to use WPA2-enterprise. WPA2-Enterprise verifies network users (AD a/c's) through a server (Domain Controller).</p><p>The recommended method of authentication is PEAP (Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol), which authenticates wireless LAN clients using only server-side digital certificates (In our case we used an AD CA) by creating an encrypted SSL/TLS tunnel between the client and the authentication server. The tunnel then protects the subsequent user authentication exchange. <br></p><h4>Requirements&#58;</h4><ul><li>802.1X-capable 802.11 wireless access points (APs)</li><li>Active Directory with group policy</li><li>Network Policy Server (NPS) servers</li><li>Active Directory Certificate Services based PKI for Server certificates for NPS computer/s and your wireless PC's</li></ul><h4>Assumptions&#58;</h4><p>This document assumes you have some knowledge of how to configure your wireless access points and install server roles.
