When your team has completed a release successfully, they should be rewarded with a morale boosting event such as lunch, dinner, the movies or bowling, so long as you can meet the following conditions:  

<!--endintro-->

1. Budget - the release must be completed within the budget allocated
2. Scope - no more than 50% reduction in work item hours
3. Quality - must pass test please and get a mark of 7/10 or above from the client
4. Time - the release cannot be delivered 50% over time e.g. if the planned finish date was 14 days (two weeks) after the start, then the release must be delivered less than 21 days after the start date
5. Release debrief - sent to the client and completed and a review of "Rules to better project management" by the project manager
