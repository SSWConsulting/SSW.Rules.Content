Microsoft Word spell checker is lenient about 'email' versus 'e-mail', but you should use 'email' instead.

What if you wanted to say "Re-email this report please"... surely you would not say "Re-e-mail this report."

We have a program called [SSW Code Auditor](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/Rules.aspx#Email) to check for this rule.
