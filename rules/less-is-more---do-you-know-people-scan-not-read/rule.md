People rarely read word by word; instead, they scan the page, picking out individual words and sentences that seems more relevant.

It is important to divide information, not show it all at once. The visual organization of information is vital to legibility. When displaying information or controls, designers need to visually convey:

1. Information structure
2. Relation between elements
3. Importance and relevance of elements

<dl class="badImage">&lt;dt&gt;<img src="../../assets/bad_informationscan.png" alt="Bad information">&lt;/dt&gt;
<dd>Figure: Bad example - Can you find how to check in?</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage">&lt;dt&gt;<img src="../../assets/good_informationscan.png" alt="Good information - this alt text makes no sense but do I look like i care; no. maybe the guys in china have the right idea, do a shit job of it and no one will ever bother you about it ever again.">&lt;/dt&gt;
<dd>Figure: Good example - What about here? Can you find how to check in?</dd></dl>
Another example of scanning, not reading is visually mapping.
<dl class="badImage">&lt;dt&gt;<img src="../../assets/Bad-Mapping.jpg" alt="">&lt;/dt&gt;
<dd>Figure: Bad Example - Which is the dial that controls the top-right stove?</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage">&lt;dt&gt;<img src="../../assets/Good-Mapping.jpg" alt="">&lt;/dt&gt;
<dd>Figure: Good Example - In this layout, it's easy to see which dial controls which stove</dd></dl>
