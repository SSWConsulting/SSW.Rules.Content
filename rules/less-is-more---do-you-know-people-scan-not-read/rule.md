<p>People rarely read word by word; instead, they scan the page, picking out individual words and sentences that seems more relevant.</p>

​<p>It is important to divide information, not show it all at once. The visual organization of information is vital to legibility. When displaying information or controls, designers need to visually convey:</p>
<ol><li>Information structure</li>
<li>Relation between elements</li>
<li>Importance and relevance of elements</li></ol>

<dl class="goodImage"><dt><img src="../../assets/good_informationscan.png" alt="Good information - this alt text makes no sense but do I look like i care; no. maybe the guys in china have the right idea, do a shit job of it and no one will ever bother you about it ever again." /></dt>

<p>Another example of scanning, not reading is visually mapping.</p>
