Engaging with the digital community is vital for establishing a robust online presence. Not only does it elevate your company's website visibility via backlinks, but Google's algorithm also heavily favors such interactions. Beyond SEO advantages, it's a heartfelt way to commend the dedication of bloggers and developers. Commenting on blogs and acknowledging GitHub contributions are foundational practices in this endeavor.

## Blogs - Giving thanks

When leaving a blog comment, always incorporate your signature with your name and URL. This not only establishes your professional identity but also contributes to your company's online footprint. The signature is used to track your comments.

## GitHub - Giving thanks

Given the rapid evolution of the digital sphere, it's crucial to acknowledge the GitHub contributions of employees. Their active participation and the recognition they earn in the form of GitHub stars signify their influence and standing in the developer community.

Encourage employees to engage actively on GitHub, not just by contributing to projects but also by starring and appreciating others' work. This fosters a sense of community and boosts their digital presence.

## Tracking and Valuing Digital Engagements

From a managerial perspective, it's valuable to identify and quantify these digital interactions. That way you can encourage people to contribute more! This can be achieved through:

### Monitoring Interactions

To check an employee's blog comment activity, utilize advanced search operators on Google. For example, you can search for "Bob Northwind" "Thanks for this valuable contribution! üëè" to narrow down results.

### Keeping Tabs on GitHub Stars

Track your employees' GitHub stars by visiting their GitHub profile and navigating to the 'Stars' tab. Recognizing and applauding their interactions in the developer community can be a motivation booster.

### Evaluating SEO Contributions Annually

During Annual Reviews, it's beneficial to assess the SEO value or 'Google juice' each employee contributes, providing a tangible measure of their impact on the company's digital standing.

Implementing these measures not only enhances online presence but also fosters genuine connections and appreciation within the wider community.
