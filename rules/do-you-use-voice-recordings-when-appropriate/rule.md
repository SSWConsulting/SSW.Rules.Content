Sometimes it is quicker to explain something verbally than it is to write a comprehensive email. This is particularly true when explaining an idea or concept relating to a product, and you need to go backwards and forwards many times to clarify details. 

If you can't easily speak directly with someone, due to schedule, travel, or time zone constraints try sending a voice recording instead.

Sending videos or voice recordings can be thought of as a slow paced conversation. There are many benefits to sending voice messages instead of email when iterating over concepts and ideas.

## Advantages of Using Videos or Voice Recordings:

1. Personal Touch - They convey emotion and emphasis more naturally, making communication feel more personal
2. Reviewable Content - Recipients can replay recordings to ensure they understand the message, which is valuable for non-native speakers
3. Efficiency - Quick recordings can streamline communication, reducing the need for multiple lengthy emails
