Writing CSS is easy. Writing a lot of CSS can become unwieldy and unmanageable. Using CSS pre-processors like LESS or SCSS helps you segment and organize your CSS logically and compiles down to regular CSS so there are extra steps to get up and running.

<!--endintro-->

The key advantage of using CSS pre-processors is nested selectors. Instead line after line of specific CSS selectors you can nest them and they will compile down for you. Check out this example:


::: bad  
![Bad Example: Using regular CSS, you repeat yourself a lot](RulesLESS - css.png)  
:::


::: good  
![Good Example: Using LESS, we can structure our CSS better](RulesLESS - less.png)  
:::

The pre-processed CSS then compiles to the regular CSS shown above.

We recommend using SCSS for its slightly more robust language scripting, however, the [differences between LESS and SCSS are minor](https://css-tricks.com/sass-vs-less/).
