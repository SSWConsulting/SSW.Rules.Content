<p>​​You should always set your working hours in your outlook calendar so others knows when you are working, this will help us to do resource scheduling.  This is especially important for people who are not working as full time, e.g. part-time, contractors etc.<br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>You can find this setting in File | Options | Calendar Options, it looks like below&#58;</p>
              <dl class="image">
               <dt><img alt="Choose your working hours" src="/PublishingImages/CalendarOptions.jpg" style="width&#58;550px;" /></dt>
               <dd>Figure&#58; Outlook Calendar options for working hours settings</dd>
               </dl>
            
            <p>
            Once you set&#160;this&#160;up, you will be able to see the&#160;grey area in &quot;Scheduling assistant&quot; so you know what's the best time to book that person.</p>
               <dl class="image">
               <dt><img alt="You can see the working hours in Scheduling Assistant." src="/PublishingImages/SchedulingAssistant.jpg" style="width&#58;550px;" /></dt>
               <dd>Figure&#58; Working hours will be shown in Scheduling Assistant</dd><dd><br></dd><dd><img src="/PublishingImages/CRM%20work%20hours.jpg" alt="CRM work hours.jpg" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;808px;" /></dd><dd></dd><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​​​​​​​​​​<strong>Figure&#58; In CRM, go to your User Profile | click the arrow to the right of your name in the breadcrumb | select work hours</strong><br></p><br>
               </dl>
