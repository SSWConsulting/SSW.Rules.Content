Comments can be useful for documenting code but should be used properly. Some developers like seeing lots of code comments and some don't.

<!--endintro-->

Some tips for including comments in your code are:

1. Comments aren't always the solution.  Sometimes it's better to refactor the comments into the actual method name. If your method needs a comment to tell a developer what it does, then the method name is probably not very clear.
2. Comments should never say  **\*what\*** the code does, it should say  **\*why\*** the code does it.  Any decent developer can work out what a piece of code does.
3. Comments can also be useful when code is missing.  For example, why there is no locking code around a thread-unsafe method.


// returns the Id of the first customer with the matching last name
public int GetResult(string lastname)
{
    // get the first matching customer from the repository
    return repository.Customer.First(c =&gt; c.LastName.StartsWith(lastname));
} Figure: Bad Example - The first comment is only valuable because the method is poorly named, while the second describes \*what\* is happening, not \*why\*public int GetFirstCustomerWithLastName(string lastname)
{
    // we use StartsWith because the legacy system sometimes padded with spaces
    return repository.Customer.First(c =&gt; c.LastName.StartsWith(lastname));
}Figure: Good Example - The method has been renamed so no comment is required, and the comment explains \*why\* the code has been written in that way
