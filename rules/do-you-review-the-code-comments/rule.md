Comments can be useful for documenting code but should be used properly. Some developers like seeing lots of code comments and some don't.

<!--endintro-->

Some tips for including comments in your code are:

1. Comments aren't always the solution.  Sometimes it's better to refactor the comments into the actual method name. If your method needs a comment to tell a developer what it does, then the method name is probably not very clear.
2. Comments should never say **\*what\*** the code does, it should say **\*why\*** the code does it.  Any decent developer can work out what a piece of code does.
3. Comments can also be useful when code is missing.  For example, why there is no locking code around a thread-unsafe method.
