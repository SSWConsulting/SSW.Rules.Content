When you need to create a new line in your string, make sure you use Environment.NewLine, and then literally begin typing your code on a new line for readability purposes.

```
string strExample = "This is a very long string that is \r\n not properly implementing a new line.";
```




::: bad
Bad Example: The string has implemented a manual carriage return line feed pair (\r\n)  
:::





```
string strExample = "This is a very long string that is " + Environment.NewLine +		 " properly implementing a new line.";
```






::: good
OK Example: The new line is created with Enviroment.NewLine (but strings are immutable)

:::



```
varÂ example = new StringBuilder();

example.AppendLine("This is a very long string that is ");

example.Append(" properly implementing a new line.");
```






::: good
Good Example: The new line is created by the StringBuilder and has better memory utilisation
