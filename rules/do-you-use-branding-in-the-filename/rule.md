It is important that the documents you provide are branded appropriately. This is not just the document's formatting, but the Title of the document and the File Name as well.

<!--endintro-->

At SSW our proposals Title and File Name are always prefixed with SSW. This allows for clients to easily recognise a proposal provided by us before even opening the document, it also immedietly identifies our documents to anyone else who may read them in the future.
