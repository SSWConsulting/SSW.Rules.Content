Check in on your home or office from your smartphone using the Control4 App - The Control4 App turns your iOS or Android mobile device into the smart home/office command center. It connects directly to your system and allows you to control and manage all of your system’s features, such as lights, temperature, cameras, audio/video equipment, smart door locks and more.

Throw away your remote controls and move on to technological freedom!
