Do you check in on your home or office from your smartphone using the Control4 App?




<!--endintro-->

The Control4 App turns your iOS or Android mobile device into the smart home/office command center. It connects directly to your system and allows you to control and manage all of your systemâ€™s features, such as lights, temperature, cameras, audio/video equipment, smart door locks and more.
