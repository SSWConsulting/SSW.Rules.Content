<ul><li>Playing a sound</li>
<li>Hiding the progress bar</li>
<li>Showing a message box at the end of the long process</li></ul>

<div>When using Message Box to indicate user a process is done, always includes detailed summary of the process. Don't just say &quot;Process completed.&quot;</div>
<dl class="badImage"><dt><div style="width&#58;40%;">Process completed. </div></dt>
