<p>Whenever a long process is churning away (e.g. about 10 seconds) users will usually do something else, either make a coffee or switch to another window.</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
​<div>Your application should remind the user to go back and check on it by:</div>
<ul><li>Playing a sound</li>
<li>Hiding the progress bar</li>
<li>Showing a message box at the end of the long process</li></ul>
<div>See rule on <a href="http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulestoBetterInterfaces-Windows-Applications.aspx#LongProcessFriendly">Do you know how to make long-running processes user-friendly?</a></div>
<div>When using Message Box to indicate user a process is done, always includes detailed summary of the process. Don't just say "Process completed."</div>
<dl class="badImage"><dt><div style="width:40%;">Process completed. </div></dt>

<div>This is just like standing at a set of traffic lights listening for the beep to know when to walk, rather than constantly looking at the red and green lights.</div>
