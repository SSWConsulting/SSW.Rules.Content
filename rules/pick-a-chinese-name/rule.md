You should pick a Chinese name for your app or product when going to China market. Here is how you should chose it:

<!--endintro-->

### 1. Phonetic or Literal Translation

#### Option 1: Use the same sound

*  LinkedIn &gt; 领英(lǐng yīng), meaning "leadership and elite"

* SugarLearning , Sugar  &gt; 雪鸽(xuě gē)  &gt;  meaning "Snow Pigeon"

#### Option 2: Use the same meaning

* Microsoft &gt; Microcomputer & Software &gt; "Micro" & "Soft" &gt; 微软 

### 2. Leverage Positive Connotations

Chinese culture places importance on auspicious meanings. Choose characters with positive associations:

* 智 (zhì, Intelligence)
* 鹏 (péng, great ambition）

Avoid characters with negative or unlucky connotations.

* **Mercedes Benz** originally could be "Bensi" ("rush to die" in Chinese); so they changed to "Benchi" ("run quickly", like flying)



### 3. Make It Memorable

Keep the name concise (2–4 characters) and ensure the name is easy to pronounce for native Chinese speakers. Collaborate with a Chinese colleague to ensure cultural accuracy and effectiveness.



### 4. Check Domain Availability

Check if the name is already in use or trademarked in China.
