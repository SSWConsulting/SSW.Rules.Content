Once your internal testing is complete and you believe the fixed price project is finished, its important to clearly communicate the beginning of the warranty period.

Send an email like this:

Hi XXX,

As per our conversation, we confirm that we have now finished the application, and so commences the 7-day warranty. The last day of the warranty will be XXX.

During this time, any defects or variations from the scope (as defined in the Specification Review document) will be fixed at no charge. See section 10 of [https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/standards/forms/ConsultingOrderTermsConditions.aspx](https&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/standards/forms/ConsultingOrderTermsConditions.aspx) for more details.

If you find things that you’d like done that are not specified in the document, we’re happy to do those on a Time & Materials basis after the warranty period has ended.
