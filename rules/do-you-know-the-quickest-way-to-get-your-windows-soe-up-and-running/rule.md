Your developers should be using the latest version of Windows for security, speed, and the latest features.

The next step is to get the Standard Operating Environment (SOE) installed. You have a few choices:

* Manually - it can take over a day to install your favorite 20 or so apps
* Windows Image - there is an overhead of maintaining the .WIM file as software changes - RECOMMENDED FOR LARGE COMPANIES WITH COMPANY OWNED DEVICES
* Use a package manager (eg. chocolatey/Winget) - RECOMMENDED FOR SMALLER COMPANIES AND ANYONE RUNNING BYOD

<!--endintro-->

### Use a package manager ([Do you use a package manager?](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/do-you-use-a-package-manager/))

Assuming that Windows is already installed, then get your SOE installed fast by following these steps:

1. Logon and configure Windows
2. Install Windows Updates
3. (Optional) Join the Domain
4. Run a script to get printers, Word templates, etc.
5. Install and run a Chocolatey script to get most of the software
6. Install any software not supported by Chocolatey
7. In case you lose your laptop, it is a good idea to stick a business card to the underneath
8. For branding, stick your company sticker to the laptop - or even better, a custom skin

8. If you are preparing the machine for someone else or migrating an old PC, you could send an email based on the template below. Don't forget to change the names where necessary:

### Hey Ana,

Your new computer is ready. ‚≠êÔ∏è

  **Done** - I have followed an SSW Rule: [https://rules.ssw.com.au/do-you-know-the-quickest-way-to-get-your-windows-10-soe-up-and-running](/do-you-know-the-quickest-way-to-get-your-windows-10-soe-up-and-running) and this included: 
* Data - I have copied the data files from your old PC (MountainGoat) to your new C: drive
