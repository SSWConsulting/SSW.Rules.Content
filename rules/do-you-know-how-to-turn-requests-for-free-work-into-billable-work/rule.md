Often clients will call up asking for a short task to be performed. You need to know how to let them know that the time will be charged.

         If it was a quick 5 mins I would do it straight away... however I need to do a little investigation... first impression is that it might take me a couple of hours... if that is OK then I would need you to authorize me to go ahead. 
     Let me know...      Good example
