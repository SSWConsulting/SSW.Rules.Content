“Your loan is approved under Section 42 of the Banking Act 2025.”  
One problem: **there is no Section 42**. 
 
That single hallucination triggered a regulator investigation and a six-figure penalty. In high-stakes domains like finance, healthcare, legal and compliance **zero-error tolerance** is the rule. Your assistant must _always_ ground its answers in real, verifiable evidence.

<!--endintro-->

## 1 – Why high-stakes domains punish guesswork

* Regulatory fines, licence suspensions, lawsuits  
* Patient harm or misdiagnosis  
* Massive reputational damage and loss of trust  

When the error budget is effectively **0%**, traditional “chat style” LLMs are not enough.

## 2 – The three-layer defense against hallucination

### 2.1  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

* **What it does** – Pulls fresh text from authoritative sources (regulations, peer-reviewed papers, SOPs) **before** answering.  
* **Win** – Grounds every claim in evidence; supports “latest version” answers.  
* **Risk** – Garbage in, garbage out. A bad retriever seeds bad context.

### 2.2  Guardrail filter

* **What it does** – Post-processes the draft answer. Blocks responses that:
  * lack citations  
  * creep into forbidden advice (medical, legal)  
  * include blanket “always/never” claims
* **Win** – Catches risky output before it reaches the user.  
* **Risk** – Over-filtering if rules are too broad or vague.

### 2.3  Question sanitizer

* **What it does** – Rewrites the user prompt, removing ambiguity and hidden assumptions so retrieval hits the right documents.  
* **Win** – Sharper queries ⇒ cleaner answers.  
* **Risk** – Requires strong NLU to keep the chat natural.

## 3 – Reference architecture

1. **Vector store & embeddings** – Pick models that benchmark well on MTEB; keep the DB pluggable (FAISS, Pinecone, Azure Cognitive Search).  
2. **Retriever tuning** – Measure recall@k, MRR, NDCG; test different chunk sizes and hybrid search.  
3. **Foundation model & versioning** – Record the model hash in every call; monitor LiveBench for regressions.  
4. **Guardrails** – Combine rule-based (regex) and model-based tools (OpenAI Guardrails, Nvidia Nemotron Guardrails).  
5. **Audit logging** – Append-only logs of user prompt, retrieval IDs, model version, guardrail outcome.

## 4 – Measurement is mandatory 🧪

Track from Day 0:

* **Exact-answer accuracy** (human-graded)  
* **Citation coverage** (every claim cited)  
* **Compliance errors** (dosage mismatch, policy breach)  
* **Hallucination rate** (uncited claims)  
* **Retrieval miss rate** (index drift, ACL failures)

## 5 – Scaling safely

| Stage | Accuracy target | Traffic share | Human-in-loop |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|---------------|
| Shadow mode | ≥ 80 % observed | 0 % | 100 % offline review |
| Pilot / augment | ≥ 80 % | ~5 % | Mandatory review |
| Limited release | ≥ 95 % on top queries | ~25 % | Spot check |
| Full automation | ≥ 99 % + zero critical | 100 % | Exception only |

Auto-fallback to a human expert if any metric dips below threshold.

## 6 – Domain experts are non-negotiable

* **Source curation** – SMEs tag “gold” paragraphs; retriever ignores the rest.  
* **Prompt reviews** – Experts catch edge cases outsiders miss.  
* **Error triage** – Every failure labeled with **why** it failed (retrieval miss, guardrail gap, model hallucination).

Treat specialists as _co-developers_, not QA afterthoughts.

## 7 – Key takeaways

* **Layer it on** – RAG + sanitization + guardrails deliver the most robust defense.  
* **Measure everything** – Strict, automated metrics keep you honest.  
* **Log & secure by default** – ACLs, encryption, append-only audit trails.  
* **Scale with care** – Stay human-in-the-loop until the data proves otherwise.

Nail these practices and you’ll move from a flashy demo to a production-grade AI assistant that never makes up the rules or facts.
