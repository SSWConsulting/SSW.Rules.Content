Communication is key in any business, but what’s most important is that team members are given a voice and encouraged to participate in communications that have an impact on how they work and do business.

See [Rules to Better Communication](/rules-to-better-communication).

1. You should ensure that staff know about, respond to, and are included in relevant company communications such as surveys, training, and announcements
2. Remind your team of communications that require time sensitive follow-ups
