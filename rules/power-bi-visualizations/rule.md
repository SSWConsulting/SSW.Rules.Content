Power BI offers a variety of visualizations, each suited for different types of data and insights. Choosing the correct visualization is crucial for effectively communicating data stories.

## Stacked Area Chart

* **Use when:** Breaking down the contribution of different components to a whole over time.

## Pie Chart

* **Use when:** Illustrating proportions within a whole.

## Donut Chart

* **Use when:** Similar to a pie chart but with a hole in the center, to emphasize the parts-to-whole relationship.

## Treemap

* **Use when:** Displaying hierarchical data as part of a whole with nested rectangles.

## Map

* **Use when:** Showing geographical data.

## Filled Map

* **Use when:** Displaying how a value varies across geographic regions, with areas filled in color.

## Scatter Chart

* **Use when:** Investigating the relationship between different variables.

## Bubble Chart

* **Use when:** Showing the relationship between variables, with a third dimension represented by bubble size.

## Waterfall Chart

* **Use when:** Showing a sequential breakdown of intermediate values leading to a final result.

## Funnel Chart

* **Use when:** Displaying the flow through a process or funnel.

## Gauge Chart

* **Use when:** Illustrating progress toward a goal or a current value within a range.

## KPI

* **Use when:** Showcasing a single key performance indicator.

## Card

* **Use when:** Highlighting a single value prominently.

## Multi-Row Card

* **Use when:** Displaying a list of multiple key metrics or attributes.

## Table

* **Use when:** Presenting detailed data and metrics in a grid format.

## Matrix

* **Use when:** Showing data structured in rows and columns, often with aggregates.

## Slicer

* **Use when:** Allowing users to filter and segment the data interactively.

## Single Row Card

* **Use when:** Displaying a single metric that stands out without additional context.

## Ellipsis (Other)

* **Use when:** Accessing additional visuals not shown directly on the visualization pane or custom visuals.

Remember, the choice of visualization should not only depend on what looks good but also on what communicates the data most effectively to your audience.

**Tip:** Always preview your data with different visualizations to determine which one best tells the story of your data.
