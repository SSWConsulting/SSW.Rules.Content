Power BI offers a variety of visualizations, each suited for different types of data and insights. Choosing the correct visualization is crucial for effectively communicating data stories.

Here's a guide to understanding when to use each type of visualization provided in Power BI, according to the visual selector interface.

## Column Chart

![Figure: Use when: Comparing categories or tracking changes over time.](column-chart.jpg)

## Stacked Column Chart

![Figure: Use when: Comparing parts of a whole across categories.](stacked-column-chart.jpg)

## Clustered Column Chart

![Figure: Use when: Comparing multiple categories and their sub-categories.](clustered-columns.jpg)

## 100% Stacked Column Chart

![Figure: Use when: Showing the percentage distribution across categories.](100-stacked-columns.jpg)

## Bar Chart

![Figure: Use when: Comparing categories horizontally.](bar-chart.jpg)

## Stacked Bar Chart

## Clustered Bar Chart

## 100% Stacked Bar Chart

![Figure: Use when: Showing the percentage distribution across categories horizontally.](100-stacked-bars.jpg)

## Line Chart

![Figure: Use when: Displaying trends over time.](line-chart.jpg)

## Line and Stacked Column Chart

![Figure: Use when: Combining trends and part-to-whole relationships.](line-and-stacked-column-chart.jpg)

## Ribbon Chart

![Figure: Use when: Visualizing ranking changes in a category over time.](ribbon-chart.jpg)

## Area Chart

![Figure: Use when: Demonstrating the magnitude of change over time.](area-chart.jpg)

An Area Chart would be chosen over a Line Chart when you want to highlight the cumulative magnitude of values over time, showing not just the trend but also the volume beneath the trend line, emphasizing the total value across the timeline.

e.g. If you are looking at the total revenue generated by a product over the same period, an area chart is better than a line chart because it not only shows the trend of revenue over time but also gives a sense of the total revenue accumulation, providing a visual impression of growth beyond just the trend line.

## Stacked Area Chart

![Figure: Use when: Breaking down the contribution of different components to a whole over time.](stacked-area-chart.jpg)

Area charts are excellent for stacked charts because it’s a simple and clear way to clearly portray the cumulative nature of the data. For example, if the above example was visualized with a line chart, it wouldn’t be immediately apparent to the user that the values are added together, not compared against each other.

## Pie Chart

![Figure: Use when: Illustrating proportions within a whole.](pie-chart.jpg)

Choose a pie chart when you need a simple, classic representation of each category's contribution to the whole, where the focus is on relative sizes of the parts to the whole.

## Donut Chart

![Figure: Use when: Similar to a pie chart but with a hole in the center, to emphasize the parts-to-whole relationship.](donut.jpg)

Opt for a donut chart over a pie chart when you want to include additional information in the center, such as the total value, or to improve readability when comparing multiple pie-like charts.

## Treemap

![Figure: Use when: Displaying hierarchical data as part of a whole with nested rectangles.](treemap.png)

A treemap is preferable to a pie or donut chart when you have hierarchical data and need to show part-to-whole relationships across multiple levels in a compact and space-efficient manner.

## Map

![Figure: Use when: Showing geographical data.](map.jpg)

## Filled Map

![Figure: Use when: Displaying how a value varies across geographic regions, with areas filled in color.](filled-map.jpg)

## Scatter Chart or Bubble Chart

![Figure: Use when: Investigating the relationship between different variables.](scatter-chart.jpg)

For example, if you're trying to identify if there's a relationship between sales volume and advertising spend, a scatter chart can plot each point of data in the two-dimensional space where one axis represents sales volume and the other represents advertising spend. 

This visualization is beneficial when you want to explore potential connections or correlations between variables, identify outliers that don't fit the general pattern, or even to see the distribution and concentration of data points. 

If a 3rd dimension is added (as above) it's represented by the size of the bubbles. this sometimes known as a Bubble Chart.

## Waterfall Chart

![Figure: Use when: Showing a sequential breakdown of intermediate values leading to a final result.](waterfall-chart.png)

The clear visualization of incremental changes helps identify how individual components contribute to the total outcome, making the waterfall chart a powerful tool for detailed, step-by-step analysis.

## Funnel Chart

![Figure: Use when: Displaying the flow through a process or funnel.](funnel-chart.png)

## Gauge Chart

![Figure: Use when: Illustrating progress toward a goal or a current value within a range.](gauge-chart.png)

In this example, a car retailer is tracking the sales team's average sales per month. The gauge needle represents the sales goal of 140 cars sold. The minimum sales average is zero and the maximum is 200. The blue shading shows that the team is averaging about 120 sales this month. They have one more week to reach the goal.

## KPI (Key Performance Indicator)

![Figure: Use when: Showcasing a single key performance indicator.](kpi.png)

This space efficient visualisation shows the target number, the current number, the variance %, and the trend of the number over time.

## Card

![Figure: Use when: Highlighting a single value prominently.](card.jpg)

## Multi-Row Card

![Figure: Use when: Displaying a list of multiple key metrics or attributes.](multi-row-card.jpg)

## Table

![Figure: Use when: Presenting detailed data and metrics in a grid format.](table.jpg)

## Matrix

* **Use when:** Showing data structured in rows and columns, often with aggregates.

## Slicer

* **Use when:** Allowing users to filter and segment the data interactively.

## Single Row Card

* **Use when:** Displaying a single metric that stands out without additional context.

## Ellipsis (Other)

* **Use when:** Accessing additional visuals not shown directly on the visualization pane or custom visuals.

Remember, the choice of visualization should not only depend on what looks good but also on what communicates the data most effectively to your audience.

**Tip:** Always preview your data with different visualizations to determine which one best tells the story of your data.
