<span class='intro'> 
  <p>Each time you deploy a new package to your SharePoint site, you should add a new entry in the version list.</p>
<p>This will enable you to quickly find out which version of the package your SharePoint site is using, and let users know what version they are running.</p>
 </span>


  <p>
    <img alt="" style="border-bottom&#58;0px solid;border-left&#58;0px solid;border-top&#58;0px solid;border-right&#58;0px solid;" border="0" src="SP_version_small.jpg" />
  </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ul>
    <li>A custom list for Version should be created at the root level of a SharePoint site collection, and each time a package is deployed - a new record should be added to this version list. </li>
    <li>A simple blank page with&#160;a Content Query Web Part can display this versions list in a friendly manner. </li>
    <li>We do not change the version numbers in the .NET Assembly because the assemblies have to be strong-name signed and deployed to the GAC.&#160; So having a versions list is crucial in working out what version of your package is deployed on which server.</li>
</ul>
