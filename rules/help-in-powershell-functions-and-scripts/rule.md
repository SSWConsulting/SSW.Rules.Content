In PowerShell, you can use Comment-Based Help snippets to better define what your function or script is doing, its examples, inputs, and outputs.

When you are building functions in PowerShell, you can use Comment-Based Help snippets at the beginning of the function body, at the end of the function body or before the Function keyword. 
If you do this, the Get-Help cmdlet will show the information contained in the code for your function (making it super easy for anyone to use and understand it!).

You can use it like this (beginning of the Function body):


<!--endintro-->



```
function Get-Function
{
<#
.<help keyword>
<help content>
#>

  # function logic
}
```

Or like this (before the function keyword):



```
<#
.<help keyword>
<help content>
#>
function Get-Function { }
```

You can do the same with scripts, with a little difference - you need to place the snippet at the beginning or end of the script file:



```
#Accept input parameters
param(
[switch]$FullAccess,
[switch]$SendAs,
[switch]$SendOnBehalf,
[switch]$UserMailboxOnly,
[switch]$AdminsOnly,
[string]$MBNamesFile,
[string]$UserName,
[string]$Password,
[switch]$MFA
)
```
