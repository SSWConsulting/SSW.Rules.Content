<p>​Examples&#160;– When giving feedback, it’s often useful to use examples.&#160;Examples help make the feedback concrete.&#160;But, don’t allow the conversation to turn into a refutation of every example.&#160;I've been in conversations where the person I'm talking with wants to go through every example I have and explain why my interpretation is wrong.&#160;Be open to being wrong but don’t let it turn into point/counterpoint.&#160;Examples are only examples to support your feedback.<br></p>
