<span class='intro'> <p>Sometimes it can be unclear to The Scrum Team whether a PBI&#160;can be completed as required.  For example the PBI&#160;&quot;automatically package with Wise after the automatic build&quot; requires investigation and experimentation to see if this is ​possible and to provide a meaningful estimate for the original.

A spike is a time boxed investigation with the output being the answer to an experiment or investigation and the resolution of an estimate for the original PBI.</p>
<p>It is then best to write a new PBI&#160;“Investigate whether it is possible to automatically build with Wise”.&#160; This PBI&#160;can be more accurately estimated and the result will allow the original PBI&#160;to be estimated or revised.</p>

<p>To embark on the original PBI&#160;when it is inestimable would be irresponsible and leave The Team with a potentially impossible PBI&#160;and the risk of a failed sprint.</p>
<p>All investigating PBId&#160;​must be timeboxed otherwise the process of investigation can meander and never come to a conclusion. </p>

<b class="ms-rteCustom-FigureGood">Figure&#58; Good example – The spike (time boxed investigation) comes first as it is impossible to estimate implementing something you do not know</b></p>
<p>Note&#58; This gives you work for future Sprints</p>
<p>Tip&#58; There is a further benefit of tagging 'spike' tasks with a consistent label. If your company takes up R &amp; D tax incentives, then you need to be able to query for activities that were 'of an experimental nature'. In Australia this is a 15% credit on each dollar you spend on a developer.</p>
