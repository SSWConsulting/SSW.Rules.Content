<span class='intro'> ​Ability&#160;to see the&#160;overall health (performance counters, exceptions, data usages, page hit counts etc.) of your application&#160;ensures you are well in control of it and have all the necessary information at your hands to action any bugs or performance issues. An&#160;analytics framework allows you to do all of that in a consistent and centralised manner.&#160; </span>

​​An analytics framework puts you in control of your application and allows you to do the following&#58;
<div><ul><li>
         <span style="line-height&#58;20px;">Capture,&#160;log and action&#160;exceptions<br></span></li><li>
         <span style="line-height&#58;20px;">Analyse performance issues and identify&#160;bottlenecks</span></li><li>
         <span style="line-height&#58;20px;">Track application usage down to individual components</span></li><li>
         <span style="line-height&#58;20px;">View and&#160;create performance reports</span></li><li>
         <span style="line-height&#58;20px;">Analyse&#160;user&#160;demographics</span></li></ul><div>There are a&#160;number of existing Analytics frameworks available on the market, so there is no need to &quot;re-invent the wheel&quot;. Why would you write your own if someone else has already taken the trouble to do it? We recommend using one of these two&#58;</div></div><div><ul><li>
         <a href="http&#58;//msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn481095.aspx">Application Insights for Visual Studio Online</a>&#160;(preferred)</li><li><a href="http&#58;//www.telerik.com/analytics"></a>Telerik Analytics&#160;&#160;</li></ul><div>
      <span style="line-height&#58;21px;">Each one of those frameworks&#160;has a fairly extensive set of tools available and are easy to integrate into your application.</span></div></div>
