## How to use Microsoft Cortana Scheduler (formerly known as Calendar.help)

This option is best if you're OK to meet any time that your calendar says is free.

**Note:** The helpful tool Scheduler has a portal too at calendar.help/user/dashboard

### Instructions to use Cortana

#### Step 1 - Register

Register yourself at Meet Scheduler before you can use this feature.

#### Step 2 - Send an email

Open an email... not an appointment!

**Figure: after your message, add some request to Cortana as you would a PA**

Cortana then handles all the back-and-forth emails to find a time when everyone can meet and then she sends out an invite on your behalf.
