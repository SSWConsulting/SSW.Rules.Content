When following up with a client or giving a status update, avoid repeating their entire message or quoting long blocks of text.
A great status update is short, clear, and easy to act on.
Your goal is to let the client understand the update in seconds, without needing to read through a long narrative. Provide just enough context and then give one clear, actionable status line.

Figure: Bad example - The reply unnecessarily repeats the client’s full message and adds noise.
