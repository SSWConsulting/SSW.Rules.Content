   <br>
</p><p>Once you've&#160;decided who&#160;your&#160;target market&#160;is,&#160;ask yourself&#58;&#160;<br></p><ul><li>Are there enough people who fit my criteria?&#160;</li><li>Will my target really benefit from my product/service?

Are they easily accessible?&#160;​<br></li></ul><div><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Now you know your audience,&#160;you need to stand out to them.&#160;&#160;You&#160;can do this by having a great Value Proposition&#160;featured&#160;on your website&#160;and throughout your campaigns.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Your Value&#160;Proposition is hands down&#160;one of the most important elements&#160;in&#160;your&#160;marketing message. It tells your potential clients&#160;<b>why they should&#160;choose&#160;you over any of your&#160;competitors</b>&#160;and it makes the benefits of your products or services crystal clear&#160;from the get-go.&#160;&#160;</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">It can be the key to attracting new business, increasing sales, and making your business a success. The main objective is to&#160;target&#160;specific groups of consumers&#160;to make your campaigns&#160;more cost-effective&#160;and making the promotion, pricing, and distribution of your products and/or services easier.&#160;</p>The key to this, is not burying your message in&#160;buzzwords&#160;or&#160;meaningless slogans. You need to highlight your message, and make it a focal point on your website, and marketing campaigns.&#160;&#160;​<br></div><div>
