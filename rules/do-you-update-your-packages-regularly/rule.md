<span class='intro'> <p class="p1">Nuget makes it easy to find and apply package updates – but this still must be performed manually.</p><p class="p1">Each package update should contain improvements but also involves a small amount of risk in the form of breaking changes or regressions.</p><p class="p1">Updating often can help mitigate this risk by ensuring that each individual update is smaller.</p><p class="p1">Recommended practice is to apply package updates at the start of a sprint so that there is time to find and resolve issues introduced by the update.​</p> </span>
