You should have at this point, either:

 1. Installer packages from 3rd Party Vendors for installing their custom solution or,
 2. WSP packages from 3rd party, or built from your own source code, or extracted using the Export Method (not recommended)

 You can add the WSP package solutions to the new server by: 
1. Open up  **cmd** with Administrator privileges
2. Enter your  **C:\SharePointCustomizations** folder
cd C:\SharePointCustomizations
3. Use  **stsadm** to import the solution to your new server
Stsadm –o AddSolution –filename NameOfSolution.wsp
4. Make sure there are no errors when the command runs
