The team think about the Architecture needed​ and how long they will need to come up with an estimate​.<br></p></li><li><h3>​​<a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=e8fba769-b2de-42f5-b5a1-e6b520dab76d">Backlog Construction</a></h3><p>The next step is Backlog Construction, also known as a Specification Review. The team proposes a high level software architecture and a to-do list called the Product Backlog. The required features are broken down into Product Backlog Items, or PBIs for short. These PBIs are estimated and, before a dollar figure is presented, a buffer is added for generic tasks such as DevOps, Testing, Bug Fixes, Project Management, etc.</p><p>A quick note, there are only 3 roles in Scrum, The Product Owner (the boss), the Scrum Master (a kind of project manager), and the Team (who do the work).<br></p></li><li><h3>

The Product Owner puts t​​he PBIs into priority order and makes sure the top ones have enough detail to be worked on. The Development Team then pulls PBIs from the top of the Backlog, and commits to delivering as much as they forecast they can, in the coming Sprint.</p></li><li><h3>​​​<a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=731a3f5d-a266-4944-876c-a45afa82832f">Sprint</a>​​​​​</h3><p>The Development Team works on features in priority order, having done a Daily Scrum and sending 'Done' emails once the

A task board is often used. During this process, the team also refines items in the Product Backlog to ensure they conform to the ​<a href="/Pages/Definition-of-Ready.aspx">'Definition of Ready'.</a></p></li><li><h3>Product Increment​<br></h3><p>During the Sprint, the Development Team works on the PBIs in priority order, and then closes them once they meet the​​ 'Definition of Done', which often includes sending 'Done' emails. Every day, they do a Daily Scrum, where they go through the Task Board and talk about what they did yesterday, what they’re planning to do today, and if they have any blockers.</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P"></p></li><li><h3> ​ 
         <a href="/Pages/CreateBugs.aspx">Product Feedback</a></h3><p>​Product Feedback will then come in. Some will be bugs, and some will be small changes that can be added to the​​ current Sprint. Other suggestions should be approve​d by the Product Owner and then added to the Product Backlog.</p></li><li><h3>

The goal is for the Product Owner to understand the increment and to discuss feedback to make the product better. This is the real measure of the success of the Sprint.<br>​<br></p></li><li><h3>​<a href="/Pages/RetrospectiveMeeting.aspx">Sprint Retrosp​​​​ective</a></h3><p>​​Lastly, there is the Sprint Retrospective, and this is the best part! The Scrum Team discusses what went well, what didn't and what to improve, always inspecting and adapting.</p></li></ol>      ​
