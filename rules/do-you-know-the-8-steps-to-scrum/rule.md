<p>​Scrum is easier than it seems, we'll explain how in these 8 simple steps. </p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<ol><li><h3><a href="/Management/RulesToSuccessfulSalesAndAccountManagement/Pages/Meetings-Prepare-for-the-Initial-Meeting-.aspx">Initial Meeting</a></h3><p>The Product Owner explains the product vision,&#160;scope is agreed, and the number of days needed for the 'Backlog Construction' is proposed.</p></li><li><h3><a href="/Management/RulestoBetterSpecificationReviews/Pages/Default.aspx">Backlog Construction</a></h3><p>A 'Backlog Construction' is performed, listing the features, technologies and a ball park of the number of sprints. Together with a rate, this becomes&#160;the estimate.</p></li><li><h3><a href="/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/SprintPlanning(WHAT)Meeting.aspx">Sprint Planning</a></h3><p>Features are ordered by the Product Owner. The Development Team estimates and forecasts which features will be delivered in the Sprint.</p></li><li><h3><a href="/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/DailyStandUpScrum.aspx">Sprint</a></h3><p>The Development Team works on features in priority order, having done a Daily Scrum and sending 'Done' emails once the 
      <a href="/Management/RulesToSuccessfulProjects/Pages/DoYouGoBeyondDoneAndFollowADoneCriteria.aspx">'Definition of Done' </a>is met. A task board is often used. During this process, the team also refines items in the Product Backlog to ensure they conform to the 
      <a href="/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/Definition-of-Ready.aspx">'Definition of Ready'.</a></p></li><li><h3><a href="/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/SprintReviewMeeting.aspx">Sprint Review</a></h3><p>The Development Team demos all the features they've completed. Feedback is gathered. This is the real measure of the success of the Sprint.</p></li><li><h3>Product Increment</h3><p>Work accepted by the Product Owner can be deployed to production. Each Sprint is a potentially shippable increment of software.</p></li><li><h3><a href="/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/CreateBugs.aspx">Product Feedback</a></h3><p>Bugs and small changes are&#160;added to the current Sprint. Other requests are added to the Product Backlog if approved by the Product Owner.</p></li><li><h3><a href="/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/RetrospectiveMeeting.aspx">Sprint Retrospective</a></h3><p>This is the best part&#58; Inspecting and adapting. Upon finishing the Sprint, the Scrum Team discusses what went well, what didn't and what to improve.</p></li><dl class="goodImage"><dt><a href="/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/PublishingImages/8Steps.jpg"><img src="/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/PublishingImages/8Steps_preview.jpg" alt="" /></a></dt><dd>Figure&#58; This Scrum image includes all the important steps from the initial meeting to the Review and Retro.
