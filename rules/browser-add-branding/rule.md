**Tips:** 

* You may have different themes, like SSW's [dark](/dark-ssw-wallpaper.png) or [light](/light-ssw-wallpaper.jpg) background images
* You can also [change your browser theme color](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/personalize-microsoft-edge-with-built-in-theme-colors/m-p/2230250) to match your branding. This is especially useful to differentiate multiple profiles in your browser
:::

Now every time you open a new tab or the browser, you will see your custom background image and immediately know which profile you are in without having to glance over to the small profile image.
