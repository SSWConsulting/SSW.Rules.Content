**Tip:** You can also [change your browser theme color](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/personalize-microsoft-edge-with-built-in-theme-colors/m-p/2230250) to match your branding. This is especially useful to differentiate multiple profiles in your browser.

## How to add a branded image to your new tab experience

Setting a different per Edge or Chrome profile background image is a great way to have some branding and quickly identify which profile you are using when opening the browser or a new tab.

1. Open your Edge or Chrome browser
2. If you are not in the new tab experience click the + button to open a new tab
3. Click on settings | Edit Background

5. Click Apply
6. Uncheck Change new background daily

7. Close the dialog box, note you might have to scroll back up to see the close button

Now every time you open a new tab or the browser you will see your custom background image and immediately know which tab you are in without having to glance over to the small profile image.
