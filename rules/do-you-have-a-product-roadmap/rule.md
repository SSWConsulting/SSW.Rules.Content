A product backlog is a great way to see the fairly small broken up PBIs (Product Backlog Items) that make up your team's "to do" list, but it can be a bit too zoomed in and makes it easy to stray from the product goals.

To get a better zoomed out view, you should have a product roadmap. 

<!--endintro-->

Having this zoomed out view helps the team to stay focused on the overall goal of the project and the long term priorities. It also prevents the team from getting sidetracked on issues that are not really what the business wants.

### Ways to track a roadmap

There are many ways to track a roadmap such as using Features or Epics - sometimes also known as MMFs (Minimum Marketable Features) - in Azure DevOps, but whatever approach you take, the concept is essentially the same.

One of the best ways is to store it all in the project wiki. 

Simply add a list of important milestones with a checkbox next to each. Then tick them off as you go. 

Ideally, you want to make some progress on product roadmap items in every Sprint, so make sure to review your product roadmap during your regular Sprint Reviews.
