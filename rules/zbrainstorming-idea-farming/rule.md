On the brainstorming day, it can be intimidating for some people to be the first person to get up and share their idea with the group. GitHub Discussions provides an awesome way to let employees discuss the ideas and iterate upon them without feeling intimidated. GitHub Discussions also provide a good platform to illustrate to attendees what ideas can look like.


1. First, look at ideas that have come through via email, and also any ideas from past brainstorming sessions
2. If necessary, call the person who came up with the idea and ask for further explanation or for them to record a Done Video to sell their idea.
3. Create GitHub Discussions for any noteworthy ideas, these discussions will serve as talking points for your company to iterate upon the idea.
1. Come up with a few ideas for the day, these should come from high-level people in the company.
2. Create A Brainstorming repo in GitHub to hold the ideas as GitHub Discussions 
   1. Use this repo template which contains the Discussion template https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Brainstorming.Template
3. Do a CTF to get ideas from the rest of the company, get them to create Github discussions
   1. The CTF should have a retro of SSW, then a question prompting them to create a GitHub Discussion with an idea
4. Go through all the ideas and pick the ones that are the most vaulable
   1. Sometimes you might need clarity on a idea, you can call then person and ask.
5. Ensure all the GitHub Discussions have enough information to be able to be worked on.
