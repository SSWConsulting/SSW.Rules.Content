"Critical distance" refers to the difference between one perspective and another, the difference between two ways of thinking about the same thing. 

Developers naturally have a builder mindset focused on success, while testers are likely to have a more skeptical, critical-thinking mindset. The critical distance between the mindset of a developer and a tester is important for excellent testing.

### Diverse teams foster increased critical distance

Diversity in testing is an idea that has to be taken seriously, because it's essential to have different perspectives to foster critical distance between mindsets. The more we're all alike, the greater the chance that we'll be fooled by missing something important. Diversity is a powerful heuristic for addressing that problem, not only diversity of genders and identities, but also of cultures, ethnicities, experiences, temperaments, skills, approaches, etc.

### Developer testing

While developers are building their code, their mental models of their work are already developed and so creating checks for specific factors and functions is straightforward. 

This means that shallow testing of simple things can easily be performed by the developer. "Shallow" here refers to problems that are near the surface, close to the coal face of where developers are working. Such shallow checking and testing is highly valuable; it's good to identify problems when they're less hard to see.

**something about focus on success, demonstrating it works, not looking for ways it might not work**

### Testing more deeply

While shallow testing is plausible at a close critical distance, deeper testing tends to require or create more distance from the builderâ€™s mindset.




Bolton tweet:

By contrast, testers are always responding. /

That is: a tester is always responding to something that has been created by someone else. This is a feature: the tester must develop an independent mental model of the product that was NOT developed in parallel with the building of it. That affords critical distance. /

Critical distance is essential in order to deep, naturalistic, linger-form testing; to find hidden, subtle, rare, intermittent, or emergent bugs; to probe the product to learn about problems unanticipated by the builders. The modest cost of that: time to develop knowledge.

Testing benefits from diverse perspectives.
cultivate critical distance - even when devs testing other devs work, etc.
