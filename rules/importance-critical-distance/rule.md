general stuff:

“Critical Distance” refers to the difference between one perspective and another. 
difference between two ways of thinking about the same thing


Testing benefits from diverse perspectives.

Shallow testing is tractable at a close critical distance,
whereas deeper or naturalistic long‐form testing 
tends to require or create more distance from the builder’s mindset

Diversity in testing is an idea that has to be taken seriously, because it's essential to have different perspectives to foster critical distance between mindsets. The more we're all alike, the greater the chance that we'll be fooled by missing something important. Diversity is a powerful heuristic for addressing that problem, not only diversity of genders and identities, but also of cultures, ethnicities, experiences, temperaments, skills, approaches... Growing recognition of that is important, and a wonderful thing.

Bolton tweet:

This is why some developers believe testing is easy: their mental models of their work are already developed, so creating checks for specific factors and functions is straightforward. That informs shallow testing of simple things. (“Shallow” is NOT an insult in this context. /

“Shallow” here refers to problems that are near the surface, close to the coal face of where developers are working. Such shallow checking and testing is very valuable; it’s good to identify problems when they’re less hard to see.) By contrast, testers are always responding. /

That is: a tester is always responding to something that has been created by someone else. This is a feature: the tester must develop an independent mental model of the product that was NOT developed in parallel with the building of it. That affords critical distance. /

Critical distance is essential in order to deep, naturalistic, linger-form testing; to find hidden, subtle, rare, intermittent, or emergent bugs; to probe the product to learn about problems unanticipated by the builders. The modest cost of that: time to develop knowledge.

To sum up: to do excellent testing, we must develop knowledge of the product by informal means, which includes informal surveys of the product and the test space. That might sound expensive, but it’s way cheaper and more powerful than premature or inappropriate formalization.
