In order to make your next event even better, you need to be able to collect feedback on the day from the people that were there.

<!--endintro-->

There are a few options on how to collect the information.

* Use a feedback form such as the one [from SSW](https&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/standards/forms/SSWEvaluationSurvey.pdf)
* Set up an online survey using services like [TypeForm](http&#58;//www.typeform.com/)
* Set-up a QR code for people to scan which links to a Microsoft Form.



Another great way to obtain feedback is to use a reward system: for example, at SSW after our events we organise QR codes for our SSW Rewards App - where attendees can scan their attendance and obtain a number of points which they can use to claim prizes. We use the QR codes for feedback as another great incentive for our attendees to give their feedback so we can iterate and improve the experience for future events!Â 



The best time to get attendees to fill out the feedback form is before the last session of the event. This is when people are still reasonably engaged and the people wanting to leave early haven't left yet.

Sometimes it is also worth getting attendees to evaluate individual speakers. This can be done with something as simple as red, yellow and green tokens to indicate how well a speaker did after each talk, or you can set up an elaborate online rating system. It really depends on what you are trying to achieve and what information you need.
