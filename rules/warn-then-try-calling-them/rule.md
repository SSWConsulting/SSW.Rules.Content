It can be very jarring when somebody is called out of the blue and they are not expecting it. They might be deep in a task or talking to a client and by calling them their focus gets disrupted. Even better, **mention the reason** before calling.

If it’s not urgent, before calling, ping someone on IM first with *"Can I call you now? It's about xxx"*

If it is urgent or you are blocked, then proceed with a warning *“Calling you in 1 min to talk about xxx.”*

The gold standard is to provide a source so the person being called has a reference explaining the reason for the call in detail.
