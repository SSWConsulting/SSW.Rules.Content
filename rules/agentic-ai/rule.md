Agents are all the rage in AI, but what are they?

AI agents are OP, they basically allow you to create autonomous actors in a system, which have the ability to use tools based on their prompt. Rather than giving a specific prompt to an LLM to complete a task, you can configure an army of agents, all with different skills and purposes, and then have a master agent who knows who to call. They're the next big thing in AI really.

What's the point of agentic 

But how do I build agents?

There are heaps of solutions! For noobs, Have. alook at operator, giving you a quick way to create multi-agent workflows with click-ops.

For devs, we have things like LangChain Agents, Autogen, and Semantic Kernel.

LangChain has been around for the longest,
Semantic Kernel and Autogen are both built by microsoft. Semantic Kernel is more stable than autogen, however doesn't have the cutting edge features of Autogen.

DO A COMPARISON TABLE OF RESEARCH BETWEEN Semantic Kernel, Autogen, LangChain Agents, and OpenAI Operator, including best usecases, learning curve rating etc...

But wait, microsoft is planning on merging autogen into semantic kernel, so we recommend semantic kernel for now, unless you can't live without the fancy features that autogen provides like agent groupchat
