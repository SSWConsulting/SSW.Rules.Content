Signing contracts - A Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) also known as a Confidentiality Agreement can sometimes have a lot of legal implications and you should be careful before signing one.

<!--endintro-->

The correct process if you have access to a legal resource would be:

1. Browse over it to see if there are any issues you can pick up (So you can learn)
2. Give it to your legal guy(s) to review and make their comments
3. Send feedback from the legal guys to the client
4. Make changes to the document as requested by the legal guys and agreed to by the client
5. Sign document

1. <font color="#333333">Specific damages (e.g. $1,000,000 per breach)</font>
2. <font color="#333333">Funny jurisdiction (at least it should be in the country you are in)</font>
3. <font color="#333333">If the agreement is not mutual you need to be extra careful. One sided agreements makes one of the parties lose out</font>
4. <font color="#333333">Always request that any indemnity be deleted
