In order to book a flight, you will need to obtain your boss' approval.

<!--endintro-->

When you need to book flights or accommodation for training or client work, liaise with the administration staff.

1. Get your manager's approval to investigate bookings and confirm dates.
2. Have a conversation with the receptionist/admin and provide some options for the bookings.
Eg: “Fly from X to Z on (date) late PM?or “I have previously stayed at ABC Hotel for work for this client and it was a convenient location at a good price.?
3. Receptionist/admin to research 2 or 3 options, aiming to keep the expenses low.
4. Admin has a conversation with you, going over the options and confirming decisions based on the research provided.
5. Final total to be approved by manager or Adam in an email (CC financial controller)
6. Admin to book and send calendar appointments as per [Booking Flights](http&#58;//sugarlearning.com/Item/9458).
7. When you receive a confirmation email for the booking, forward it to the financial controller for reconciliation with bank statements.

Include the screen shot of the flight options and costs.
