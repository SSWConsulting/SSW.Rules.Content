Development for SharePoint is very different depending upon whether you are online or using old On-Premises SharePoint. 

<!--endintro-->

### For SharePoint 2019, 2016, 2013, 2010

1. It's very important to correctly setup a SharePoint environment for development. Correctly configured, this will save you a lot of trouble later on.
2. From time to time, you can seriously damage a SharePoint installation during development and it is best not to install SharePoint on your everyday working machine. Additionally, when you start a new SharePoint project you don't want to carry all the luggage from a previous customization that could potentially affect your new project.
3. Virtual machines can be fired up and shut down easily.
4. Virtual machines can be relocated on a different server and thus it doesn't waste developers' own computer resources.
5. Virtual machines can be copied and brought to a client for demonstration.
6. Very easy for someone to quickly create a new SharePoint server to quickly test or experiment with SharePoint.
7. Bad - There might be more work required to activate additional servers. SharePoint Farms are a lot of work. E.g. Search Server VMs.

### For SharePoint Online 

Use VSCode â€“ all modern customizations are doing using the [SharePoint Framework (SPFx)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/sharepoint-framework-overview).
