<p>The text swing in can be a great way to make a title gain attention, but if the angles are wrong, the unnatural nature of it will be jarring. We recommend After Effects as the tool to do this.</p><ul><li>Each keyframe should be half the angle of the previous keyframe from 90 degrees</li><li>Each keyframe should be half the distance on the timeline from the previous keyframe</li></ul>
