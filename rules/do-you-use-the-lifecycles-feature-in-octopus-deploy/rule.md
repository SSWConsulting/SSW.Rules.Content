<span class='intro'> <p><a href="http&#58;//octopusdeploy.com/blog/2.6">Octopus Deploy 2.6</a> introduced a new Lifecycles feature that makes Continuous Integration from TFS much easier. It's a must have for projects in TFS that&#160;use&#160;Octopus for deployment.</p><p>As well as allowing continuous integration, the Lifecycles feature adds some good governance around when a project&#160;can be deployed to each environment.</p> </span>

<p>Lifecycles can be found in the Library section of Octopus Deploy. By default, a project will use the Default Lifecycle which allows any deployment at any time.</p><dl class="image"><dt><img src="Octopus_Lifecycles.png" alt="Octopus_Lifecycles.png" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Lifecycles can be found in the Library</dd></dl><p>You should create a new Lifecycle for each project you've configured with Octopus Deploy. You should set up a phase to&#160;continuously deploy to your first environment (e.g.&#160;test or staging), but make sure the final phase of the lifecycle is a manual step to production.<br></p><dl class="image"><dt> <img src="SugarLearning_Lifecycle.png" alt="SugarLearning_Lifecycle.png" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good Example - This lifecycle has two phases&#58;&#160;an automatic release to a Staging server, and a manual release to the Production server.</dd></dl><p>In the Process tab of your project definition,&#160;there's a panel on the right-hand side that lets you configure the Lifecycle to use. You should also enable Automatic Release Creation. If you have a CI build which&#160;publishes&#160;a new package to the Octopus NuGet feed as part of your build using OctoPack, and&#160;your first Lifecycle phase is automatic, this will result in continuous deployment to your CI environment.</p><dl class="goodImage"><dt><img src="Lifecycle_CI.png" alt="Lifecycle_CI.png" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good Example -&#160;This combination results in Continuous Deployment to the Staging server when a new package is pushed</dd></dl> â€‹
