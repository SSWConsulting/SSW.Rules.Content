When creating a SharePoint Modern page, you can use many different webparts to enrich your content - Videos, Embedded PowerBI, and many more. 

When you want to add plain text to a page, you have two choices: Text (or Rich Text) Webpart, or Markdown WebPart.

Whenever possible, you should use the Text WebPart as it offers a much nicer editing experience, but more importantly provides a detailed Version History.

![Figure: You can navigate to the page version history through "Page Details" | "Version History"](version-history-nav.png)

Tip: Don't forget to switch "Highlight changes on the page"
