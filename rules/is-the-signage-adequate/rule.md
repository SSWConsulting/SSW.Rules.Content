Make sure your event is well signposted, so your attendees can find not only the venue, but also important areas within it.

<!--endintro-->

Your signage could include the following

* Directions from nearby transport, such as train stations and bus stops
* Registration area
* The agenda for the day to inform attendees of what is next
* Nearest toilets
* Room numbers (if the venue doesn't have that already)
