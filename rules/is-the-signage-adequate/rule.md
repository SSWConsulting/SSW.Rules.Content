<p>Make sure your event is well signposted, so your attendees can find not only the venue, but also important areas within it.&#160;</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>​Your signage could include the following</p><ul><li>Directions from nearby transport, such as train stations and bus stops</li><li>Registration area</li><li>The agenda for the day to inform attendees of what is next</li><li>Nearest toilets</li><li>Room numbers (if the venue doesn't have that already)</li></ul>
