A mnemonic for a button is the letter which has an underscore, and the user can press the button using `Alt-<char>`.

::: good

In Windows Applications, it is quite easy to assign a mnemonic to a button with the "&" character.

So for the case above, the text would be:

```cs
btnAbout.Text = "&About"
```
