ASP.NET MVC makes good use of NuGet for managing its dependencies, however these dependencies can easily get out of date.

<!--endintro-->

When you begin a new MVC project, there are often many dependencies that already have updated versions.

You should immediately update your NuGet dependencies in the NuGet Package Manager after starting an MVC project. You should also frequently check for new updates during development so youâ€™re not working with out of date versions.
