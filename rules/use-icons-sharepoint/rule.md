Out of the box, SharePoint provides widgets (aka webparts) to style your link with a consistent look and feel. Standard left navigation also supports emojis 💖.

If that's not enough and you want to customize your own links somewhere else on screen, use CSS to match the extension at the end of the &lt;a&gt; tag. Don't forget to add some padding to give it some space before the text (where the icon will be).

### Option A: Use Out of the Box configurable Webparts (Recommended)

Using webparts is the best way to achieve a consistent look and feel. Webparts can be customized by admin users, and require no maintenance as far as styling is concerned. SharePoint uses Office UI Fabric icons under the hood.
