<span class='intro'> <div>​It is important to use correct capitalization when writing titles/headings for things.</div><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">&quot;The Lord of the rings – Return of the king&quot;</p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad">Figure&#58; Bad Example – The first letter of the first and last words should always be capitalized</dd><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">&quot;The Lord of the Rings – Return of the King&quot;</p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Figure&#58; Good Example – Only conjunctions and prepositions (both having similar rules) should not be capitalized e.g. at, on, but, and, with etc.​​</dd><br> </span>

<p>​It's best to only do this on main titles (which are important), and leave subtitles in normal sentence form. Basically it saves hassles... English is a confusing language and there are too many variations that cause too many arguments.​</p><p>​<img src="good-example-of-capitalizing-titles.jpg" alt="Good Example - the main title has capitalization and the sub-titles don't" style="margin&#58;5px;" /><br></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Figure&#58; Good Example - the main title has capitalization and the sub-titles don't​<br></dd>
