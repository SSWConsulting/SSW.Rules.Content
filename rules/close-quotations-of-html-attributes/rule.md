It is always better to make sure there are equivalent closing quotations for HTML attributes. A small mistake of missing a quotation could lead to undesired results on the web page.

<span style="font-size:12pt; background: #ccc;>

```
<span style="font-size:12pt; background: #ccc;">
```




::: good
Figure: All OK

As you can see from the above example, just missing a quotation makes the whole layout of the text different. So be very careful that you make sure you have closed all opening quotations of attributes with equivalent closing quotations.

We have a program called [SSW Code Auditor](https&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/codeauditor/) to check for this rule.
