   <strong>Scenario&#58;</strong><br>Scope - You are building a consumer facing service that will have multiple clients, including a <a href="https&#58;//docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2013/november/asp-net-single-page-applications-build-modern-responsive-web-apps-with-asp-net">SPA​</a> and a mobile app. 
   <br>Social - You want to allow your users to sign up with their social identities (Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.) but want to allow them to create an account with you if they don't have a social login or don't want to use it. 
   <br>All users will have the same level of access once logged in. 
   <br>Volume -&#160;You anticipate 20,000 active users.

For example,&#160;cost may be a factor and saving money may be more important than the added benefits of higher cost options.

<h3>ASP.NET Core Identity (simple and free)<br></h3><p>ASP.NET Core has some built in identity functionality that allows you to create users and roles, and manage the security of your web applications. It is extremely capable and can be used to support a broad number of scenarios. However, it is intended for use in simple web applications, and while it can be extended to support other clients, you will need to build and wire up a lot of the UI for these scenarios yourself. Your identity store will be limited to this one application, so your users will not be able to share this identity across multiple applications.<br><br></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood"> Advantages​​&#58;<br></dd><ul><li></li><li>Free</li><li>Easy to set up and use</li><li>Supports OAuth2/OIDC&#160;providers</li></ul><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad"> Disadvantages​​&#58;<br></dd><p></p><ul><li>It is recommended by Microsoft that&#160;for advanced requirements you don't use this on its own - so need to add one of the below</li><li>Does not scale well across multiple applications - so need to add one of the below<br></li><li>For anything other than an ASP.NET Core Web app (e.g. Angular, React&#160;or mobile), you have to build all UI yourself, such as&#58;&#160;<span style="background-color&#58;initial;">sign up, l</span><span style="background-color&#58;initial;">og, p</span><span style="background-color&#58;initial;">assword reset,&#160;e</span><span style="background-color&#58;initial;">tc.</span></li></ul><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">
