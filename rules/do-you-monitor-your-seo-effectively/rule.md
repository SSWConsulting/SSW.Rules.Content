SEO means working with a large amount of data. A single website can have even up to thousands of subpages, keywords, and internal links. If it’s operating in a competitive industry, it needs external links from thousands of domains. What if you’re optimizing several websites? The result? Big Data.

What can (and should) be monitored in SEO:

1. The organic traffic on the website
2. Availability (uptime)
3. Loading speed
4. Correct functioning
5. Domain and SSL certificate expiration
6. Being present on blacklists
7. Robot blockers

At SSW, SEO workflow is:

1. The Marketing Manager checks the SEO weekly and analyses trends in keywords
2. The Marketing team gets it checked
3. The Marketing Team checks with the SSW SEO consultant should analyze the SEO progress each month or two when the team catches up
