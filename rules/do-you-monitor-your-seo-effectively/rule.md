If it’s operating in a competitive industry, it needs external links from thousands of domains. What if you’re optimizing several websites? The result? The era of Big Data in SEO.

#### What can (and should) be monitored in SEO

1. Organic Traffic: Keep a close eye on the organic traffic your website is attracting.
2. Availability (Uptime): Ensure your website is consistently accessible to users.
3. Loading Speed: Page speed matters for both user experience and search engine rankings.
4. Correct Functioning: Regularly check for any issues affecting the proper functioning of your website.
5. Domain and SSL Certificate Expiration: Stay on top of domain and SSL certificate renewals to avoid interruptions.
6. Blacklist Status: Ensure your website isn't listed on any blacklists, which can harm your reputation.
7. Robot Blockers: Check for any factors that might be blocking search engine bots from indexing your content.
