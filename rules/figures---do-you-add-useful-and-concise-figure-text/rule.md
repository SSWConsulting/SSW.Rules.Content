<span class='intro'> <p>When you add an image to a website or application, follow the Microsoft Word standard and use <strong>&quot;Figure&#58; Description&quot;</strong> to describe your images.</p><p>It's the best way of ensuring you catch users' attention to the content of your page. When you're scanning a newspaper for interesting articles, you'll check out the pictures, read the accompanying description, and if it sounds interesting you'll go back and read the article.</p>
                     </span>

<p>Users read websites in a similar fashion. Catch their attention with an image, and then keep it with a useful description. Don't just describe what the image is; say what it's used for in the context of the document. Look at these bad and good captions.</p><dl class="goodImage"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/good-caption.jpg" alt="Good Caption" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good Example - Some nice useful text describing the image</dd></dl><p>It is especially important that images serve a purpose, as opposed to images which are there solely for design.&#160;A good example of this rule can be seen in&#160;the figures at&#160;<a href="https&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/UserGuide.aspx">SSW Code Auditor User Guide</a> page. <br></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Related Rules​<br></h3><ul><li><a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=02a131ff-813e-4cfc-8012-51959b6edc15">Screenshots - Do you use balloons instead of a 'Wall of Text'?​</a><br></li><li><a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=e3ebb989-c11a-4fd4-8b47-8f62a8cc7557">Do you show a &quot;bad example&quot; and a &quot;good example&quot; to clearly explain the DOs and DON'Ts?​</a><br></li></ul>
