<span class='intro'> <p>When you add an image to a website or application, follow the Microsoft Word standard and use <strong>&quot;Figure&#58; Description&quot;</strong> to describe your images.</p><p>It's the best way of ensuring you catch users' attention to the content of your page. When you're scanning a newspaper for interesting articles, you'll check out the pictures, read the accompanying description, and if it sounds interesting you'll go back and read the article.</p>
                     </span>

<p>Users read websites in a similar fashion. Catch their attention with an image, and then keep it with a useful description. Don't just describe what the image is; say what it's used for in the context of the document. Look at these bad and good captions.</p><dl class="goodImage"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/good-caption.jpg" alt="Good Caption" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good Example - Some nice useful text describing the image</dd></dl><p>It is especially important that images serve a purpose, as opposed to images which are there solely for design.</p><p>Read <a href="/screenshots-do-you-use-balloons-instead-of-a-wall-of-text">Screenshots - Do you use balloons instead of a 'Wall of Text'? </a></p>
