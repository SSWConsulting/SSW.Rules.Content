The &lt;font&gt; tag is supported in all major browsers, however it is deprecated since HTML 4... so it should **not** be used. Learn more at [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_font.asp).

**Tip:** The best practice is to CSS classes to define the font family, size, and color.

We have a program called [SSW Link Auditor](https://sswlinkauditor.com) to check for this rule.
