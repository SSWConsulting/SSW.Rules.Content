Have you ever seen the text in an email or YouTube description that is meant to be a link to a page and wondered why it's missing the customary blue underline or why it can't be clicked? 

The answer is simple: the links are missing the prefix " https:// ", a prefix most modern content editors or browsers recognise as link identifiers and convert otherwise normal-looking text into easily clickable links.
