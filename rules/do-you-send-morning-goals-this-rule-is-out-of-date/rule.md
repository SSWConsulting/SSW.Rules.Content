<span class='intro'>  
<font color="#ff0000">*Note</font>&#58; We no longer do this, we now do our daily stand-up meetings (Scrums) because it is more effective with interactions between team members. 

   <p>(An alternative to morning goals is having 
      <a href="/Pages/DailyStandUpScrum.aspx" shape="rect">daily stand up meetings</a> (scrums) which is more effective for interactions between team members and the client/manager. We now prefer scrums.)</p> 
<s>   <p>Before a day starts it is not only important to have a list of what you plan on achieving that day but to communicate that list to your manager and/or client. This not only keeps you accountable but allows your superior to change your priorities if needed.</p> 
   <p>You can use eXtreme Emails to communicate your &quot;Morning Goals&quot; using the following method&#58;</p> </s>  </span>

<font class="ms-rteCustom-FigureGood">Figure&#58; Sample Morning Goals Email </font><br>
<s>
<ul>
    <li>Forward the previous morning goal from yesterday, striking out completed items </li>
    <li>Comment (in a different colour) and give the reason whether any items were not completed </li>
    <li>Copy outstanding items to today's morning goals, appending any new information </li>
    <li>If we are working on-site we always send our morning goals from our SSW mail account, not an internal account the client may choose to give us. This enables us to keep a record of the email, and also keeps the branding consistent. If this is not possible, we always CC our SSW account (and then move the emails into your &quot;<a href="/do-you-save-important-items-in-a-separate-folder" shape="rect">Saved Items</a>&quot; when you get back to the office) </li>
    <li>If something more important arises during the day, we note it down on the next days morning goals. </li>
    <li>If a task is huge (e.g. clean up my email inbox) and we only aim to do a portion of it, we say so in the morning goals as well.<br>

CC the people you are working with on the email. </s>
