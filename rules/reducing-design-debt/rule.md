It‚Äôs tempting to fix small UI issues on the fly, change a button size, adjust spacing, swap a color. But those ‚Äúquick wins‚Äù often lead to **design debt**: a messy, inconsistent UI that slows development and confuses users.

<!--endintro-->

Design debt is like tech debt - shortcuts that feel efficient now but cause long-term pain. Without a system, visual inconsistencies multiply, user experience suffers, and devs waste time second-guessing design intent.

### What to do instead

* **Follow a design system** ‚Äì Use shared components and patterns
* **Loop in a designer** ‚Äì Ask via a "Test Please" or include them on the PBI
* **Track changes properly** ‚Äì Create a PBI so the team can prioritize and review

### Examples

::: greybox
You tweak a button‚Äôs padding in the code without talking to design or logging the change.

::: bad
Figure: Bad Example ‚Äì A solo change that adds inconsistency and confusion
:::
::: greybox
You notice the button looks off, raise a UI PBI, and get design feedback before making the change.
:::
::: good
Figure: Good Example ‚Äì A team-reviewed change that aligns with the design system

### Treat design like code

Every visual tweak affects the product. Involve the right people, follow process, and respect the system‚Äîjust like you would with technical architecture. ü§ñ
