Sometimes it can be unclear to The Scrum Team whether a Story can be completed as required.&#160;

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
For example the story “automatically package with Wise after the automatic build” requires investigation to see if this is possible.&#160; It is then best to write a new story “Spike - Investigate whether it is possible to automatically build with Wise”.&#160; This story can be more accurately estimated and the result will allow the original story to be estimated or revised. We call that investigation a Spike.<br>
<br>
All Spikes are experiments or investigations of just enough detail to determine an estimate for the related story.&#160; All Spikes must be timeboxed as&#160;otherwise&#160;the process of&#160;investigation can meander and never come to a conclusion.&#160;<br>
<br>
To embark on the original story&#160;when it was inestimable would be irresponsible&#160;and leave The Team with a potentially impossible story and&#160;the risk&#160;of a failed sprint.
