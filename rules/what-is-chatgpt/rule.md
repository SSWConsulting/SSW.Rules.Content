ChatGPT is a refined version of [GPT](/what-is-gpt-3). Essentially, it takes the model of GPT and turns it into a chat bot that responds in a human-like manner.

ChatGPT provides a more realistic interaction for end-users, a more user-friendly interface and a softer set of responses.

For example, if you asked GPT "Can you help me find information about Northwind?" it would provide you a very direct answer that may lack some tact.

On the other hand, ChatGPT provides a human-friendly response.

### Why is ChatGPT cool?
::: greybox
As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or emotions. However, I can tell you why ChatGPT is useful and popular among users:

Natural language understanding: ChatGPT has been trained on a large dataset of diverse text and is able to understand the context and meaning of words and phrases, allowing for more human-like conversations.

Versatility: ChatGPT can perform a variety of tasks, including answering questions, generating text, translating languages, and more.

Speed and efficiency: ChatGPT can generate responses quickly, making it a useful tool for conversational interfaces, customer service, and other applications that require quick responses.

Accuracy: With its vast knowledge base and language processing capabilities, ChatGPT is able to provide accurate answers to a wide range of questions and can generate high-quality text that is often difficult for humans to distinguish from text written by a person.

Overall, the ability of ChatGPT to understand and generate human-like text has made it a popular tool for businesses and individuals looking to enhance their conversational interfaces and improve their productivity.
