<span class='intro'> 
  <p>Add an extra column to the “Version History” page to show how big a change was made in each version (in number of lines modified or MB changed or something).</p>
<p>In this case the editor (Ulysses) clicked on edit just to see what it looked like from an Editor’s viewpoint, but there is no indication that there was no significant change.</p>
<p>The edits that were not significant should show their records as dimmed. </p>
 </span>
