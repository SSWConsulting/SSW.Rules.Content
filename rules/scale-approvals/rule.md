In small companies, a single key stakeholder often approves everything, ensuring alignment with the organizational vision and strategy. However, as the company grows, this can lead to bottlenecks. To address this, one strategy is to create an employee responsibility, which lists the people responsible for a specific approval. This list creates a clearly communicated system for [cross-authorization](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/purchase-please/#cross-authorization).

<!--endintro-->

## Benefits of scaling approvals
✅ Significant time savings for the person causing the bottlenecks (aka the "original approver")

✅ Fewer bottlenecks for those seeking approval

✅ Consistent and high-quality approvals

## Developing the system
There are 4 steps to developing the new system of approvals.

1. Identify - Find tasks causing "approval hell" aka bottlenecks
2. Assign - Appoint trusted subject matter experts to be responsible
3. Classify - Determine the importance of the task
4. Implement - Document and induct the new approvers

### 1. Process - Identify tasks causing "approval hell"
Before being able to fix "approval hell", problem tasks need to be identified. For example, there might be delays in approval for induction completion.

### 2. Assign - Appoint trusted subject matter experts to be responsible
Start building out a list of people who are experts on that subject. Those people will become the ones responsible for approvals.

Once the list is compiled, assign each person a priority. That determines the order to contact people.

Tip: Set the "original approver" as the lowest priority to minimize their involvement.

### 3. Classify - Determine the importance of the task
Some tasks are more valuable than others, which means the level of quality check required will be different. For example, a task to fix spelling mistakes probably doesn't matter as much as something like deleting invoices. Therefore, you would assign more approvers to the task for deleting invoices.

Try to categorise the task depending on the level of importance. Then, the number of approvers for an item should be based on this categorisation.

- Low-Medium Importance: 1 approval
  - e.g. Submitting a leave request
- Medium-High Importance: 2 approvals
  - e.g. Sending a company wide email 
- Critical Importance: 3+ approvals or consider leaving it with the "original approver".
  - e.g. Opening a new office location 

### 4. Implement - Document and induct the new approvers
The final step is to record all the established decisions and induct the new approvers.

1. Induct each person by having them shadow the "original approver" for at least 3 approval processes, ensuring they understand the goal.
2. Document the new approvers in a central repository, naming it {{ APPROVAL }} Masters.
3. Update the standard so that instead of contacting the "original approver", individuals contact the new approvers in order until they get the required number of approvals as determined when classifying the importance of the task.

## Keeping Approvers Aligned
Sometimes approvers 

5. Explain to the new approvers if they think the approval may be controversial or if unsure about how to handle something add in the "original approver". That way everyone is aligned
Note: The requirement for two approvals instills confidence in the process for the "original approver".

## Communicating the streamlined approvals process
This process should ideally be implemented across all business bottlenecks. However, identifying the most problematic approvals can be challenging. 

To solve this, communicate the new approval process company-wide, encouraging employees to suggest areas for implementation. This crowdsourcing approach should yield valuable feedback on where to apply the streamlined approval process.
