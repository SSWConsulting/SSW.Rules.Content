<p>When others mention you on their blog or podcast and if they re-tweet you then you should always thank them&#58;</p><blockquote><p>@<a href="http&#58;//twitter.com/briankel" shape="rect">briankel</a><img title="You are now leaving SSW" src="/_LAYOUTS/15/Images/SSW/external.gif" alt="" /> said something nice about me in his 100th This Week On Channel 9 episode

      <br><strong>Figure&#58; Good example, always thanking someone is not just good practice and polite, you both get Google juice as well.<br><br> </strong></p></blockquote><p>Remember to say something constructive and not just 'thanks'.</p> ​​​
