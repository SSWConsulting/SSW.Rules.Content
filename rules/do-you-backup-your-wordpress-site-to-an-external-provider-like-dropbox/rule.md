Backing up your WordPress site is important and while most hosting providers will perform backups on your behalf, it doesnâ€™t hurt to have another copy tucked away safely. For this purpose we use and recommend the     [BackWPup WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/backwpup).

<!--endintro-->

It simplifies WordPress backups and can be configured to back up your site to:


* FTP server
* **Dropbox**
* Amazon S3 services
* **Microsoft Azure**
* RackSpaceCloud
* SugarSync



We setup our WordPress sites to backup daily to Dropbox:
