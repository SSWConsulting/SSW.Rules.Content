Typescript is the best choice when writing Angular and React applications. Angular is even written in Typescript itself! 

<!--endintro-->

Here are a few reasons why typescript is great:
- Type safety
  - Find and fix errors at build time rather than encountering nasty surprises at runtime
  - Have great tooling support (Autocomplete/Intellisense, code navigation, linting)
  - Refactoring codebase - the great tooling support will help you save time compared to JS
  - Use the latest language features - write more concise code
- Makes code more self expressive with syntax sugar
  - Auto - import
- Support more browsers
  - Target multiple JS versions (es5, 6) with a single typescript codebase
- Reduces risk, maintainability increases code confidence
  - More code confidence means less time spent writing unit tests
  - Spot bugs earlier
  - Cleaner, easier to understand code
