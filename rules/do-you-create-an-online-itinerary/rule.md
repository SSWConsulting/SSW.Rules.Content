<span class='intro'> As well as sending details of bookings to the traveler's​​​ outlook calendar, we also use tripit.com to consolidate the details of bookings for flights, hotels, car rentals, etc. TripIt can make a single, easy-to-read online itinerary that can be viewed by anyone you choose to share the link with, making it easy to keep co-travelers, spouses, co-workers, etc. in the loop.<div><br>After joining tripit.com, forward a copy of each booking confirmation to plans@tripit.com to store the details of upcoming journeys. Multiple items can then be merged to form one master itinerary that covers the whole trip.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="/PublishingImages/tripitimage.png" alt="tripitimage.png" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;808px;" /><br></div><div><strong>Figure&#58; A TripIt Itinerary example</strong></div><div><br>For more information or to join, visit&#160;<a href="https&#58;//www.tripit.com/">tripit.com&#160;​​</a><br></div> </span>
