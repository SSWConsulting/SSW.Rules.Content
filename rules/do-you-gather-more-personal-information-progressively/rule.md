Most people don't like to disclose personal information and in some cases will give    you dud data. This is more often the case when people are required to give a lot    of information at one time. What we have found at SSW is that you will get better    quality personal information at intervals and not all at once.

For example: Lets say I go to a website to download some software, but to do this    the company requires me to give my Name, Address, Phone Numbers & email address.    The likelihood of them receiving my correct details are limited as I don't know    what they will do with these details and I don't know the company at all. However,    if that same company only asked me for my username and email    address only I would be more inclined to leave them the correct information as this    is not as intrusive and a lot quicker. I would also be more inclined to go back    to that website and download more, which is when you ask the user for that little    bit more information.

The second time round that company may ask me for my real name and a phone    number. Again this is not as daunting because as the user I have already given this    company some of my information and feel that I can trust them a bit more than the    average company.

The third time I go to download they ask me for a little bit more information, so    by the time I have visited their site to download I have effectively given that    company all my personal information.

Of course this does not guarantee that people will cease inputting dud data, it does    decrease the chances though!
