<span class='intro'> As of the December 2012 Service Update (online) and Rollup 12 (on-prem) HTML Component (HTC) are disabled by default. This mean any JavaScript that references the V4&#160;API will fail. Using the CRM Custom Code Validation Tool will help you to track down this legacy code and update it. It is not recommend to  re-enable the HTC controls as it will just create more problems down the track. </span>
