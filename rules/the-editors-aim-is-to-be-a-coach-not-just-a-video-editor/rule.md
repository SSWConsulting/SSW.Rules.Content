The goal is to have a presenter give the editor zero cuts. Editors should inform the speaker when they have to clean up their presentation in post-production (and you think they would likely make the same mistake again next time).

<!--endintro-->

When the editor hits an issue, talk to the speaker, show them the problem and make them practice doing it again, the right way until  you give them a 'pass'.

Now you can hope they won't do it next time, and you won't need to do an edit.
