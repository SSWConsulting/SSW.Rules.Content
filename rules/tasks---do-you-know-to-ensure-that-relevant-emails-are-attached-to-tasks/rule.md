<p>​Often you will receive rich information from your Product Owner (Customer) about tasks. That information can be in the form of Word documents, HTML Emails and Pictures, but you generally receive them in the context of an Email. This should be done by one person called the scribe.​</p>
<div class="greyBox" style="margin-bottom&#58;20px;">
   <h3>The Scribe will&#58;</h3><ol><li>take screenshots and notes</li><li>turn them into multiple emails</li><li>add them into the backlog with Team Companion (can be added directly into TFS on Web Browser)</li></ol></div>

You can attach this content manually, but it can be time consuming.</p><p>

When you “reply all” to the email all of the interested parties to the Task are also included. This notifies those that may have been blocked by your task to keep up to date with its status.</p>
