<span class='intro'> 
  <p>The designer should be used for all GUI design. Controls will be dragged and dropped onto the form and all properties should be set in the designer, e.g.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Labels, TextBoxes and other visual elements </li>
    <li>ErrorProviders </li>
    <li>DataSets (to allow data binding in the designer) </li>
</ul>
 </span>


  <p>Things that do not belong in the designer&#58;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Connections </li>
    <li>Commands </li>
    <li>DataAdapters </li>
</ul>
<p>However, and <b>DataAdapter</b> objects should not be dragged onto forms, as they belong in the business tier. Strongly typed <b>DataSet</b> objects should be in the designer as they are simply passed to the business layer. Avoid writing code for properties that can be set in the designer.</p>
