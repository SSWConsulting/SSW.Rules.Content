Many people hesitate to rely on AI, fearing it will replace human decision-making or lead to uncritical dependence. However, the real problem isnâ€™t using AIâ€”itâ€™s using it blindly. Just like any other tool, AI should be leveraged intelligently to enhance productivity and decision-making.

The best approach is to become a *centaur* â€” a combination of human intelligence and AI efficiency. Ignoring AI altogether is just as irresponsible as using it without critical thinking.

## Be transparent when using AI

Transparency is key when using AI-generated content. If AI is simply refining your own work, disclosure may not be necessary. However, there are cases where you should clearly communicate AI involvement:

* **If significant portions of content are AI-generated** â€“ For example, if an AI writes an entire report, readers should know that
* **If AI-generated content influences decision-making** â€“ If you're making a business decision based on AI recommendations, others involved should be aware
* **When AI involvement impacts trust** â€“ For instance, using AI-generated customer reviews or testimonials without disclosure is unethical

See [Do you indicate when AI helped? ðŸ¤–](/indicate-ai-helped) for details.

## Apply critical thinking

You get out what you put in, both in context and effort. To get meaningful results:

1. **Give the AI full context** â€“ Include any important data or background information
2. **Give it some direction** â€“ Include some bullet points for your initial solution to the problem
3. **Edit the AI generated responses** â€“ Never assume the first response is perfect; refine it to match your needs

## Understand AIâ€™s boundaries

AI is powerful, but it has limitations:

* **Fact-check information** â€“ AI can hallucinate or present outdated info. Always verify with Google.com, Perplexity.ai, or subject matter experts
* **Know what AI can and can't do** â€“ It excels at summarizing, brainstorming, and coding assistance but struggles with nuanced reasoning and real-world context.  
   **Note:** Capabilities are rapidly advancing, so keep your finger on the pulse

## Protect data privacy

AI services differ in how they handle user data. Be mindful of:

* **Training data policies** â€“ Make sure you opt-out of your conversations being used to train the models
* **Confidentiality** â€“ Never enter sensitive company data unless using private AI models
* **Secure options** â€“ If needed, run AI models privately via Azure, a private cloud, or even offline using Ollama

## Use the right tool for the right job

Maximize AIâ€™s potential by using the right tools for the right tasks:

* **Use ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.** â€“ For emails, web content, marketing materials, documentation, and training resources
* **Use AI voice mode** â€“ Itâ€™s great as a sounding board or to explain concepts
* **Use GitHub Copilot or Cursor** â€“ For generating boilerplate code, auto-completions, unit tests, and debugging

## Be proud of your AI use

AI isnâ€™t something to hide or fear. When used correctly, it enhances efficiency and decision-making. The key is to use it *responsibly* â€” with transparency, critical thinking, and respect for privacy.
