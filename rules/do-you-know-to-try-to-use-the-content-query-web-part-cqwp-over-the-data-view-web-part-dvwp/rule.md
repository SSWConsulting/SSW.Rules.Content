These controls are similar, but the DVWP needs heavier customization and should be avoided where possible.

The CQWP is easier to style. The DVWP should only be used if you need one of these features:

1. You only want to search on one column in the list, rather than all the (indexed) columns.
2. You want to perform a search on multiple lists, but not all the lists on a web.
3. You want to have a very specific Look and Feel that the search results use.
