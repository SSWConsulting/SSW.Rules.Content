<span class='intro'> When your Hyper-V environment is spread across multiple hosts and contains many Virtual Servers, it can get very confusing to find the one you are looking for&#160;amongst them all. This is why you should use a standard naming convention for all your Virtual machines.

<strong class="ms-rteCustom-FigureBad">Bad Example - How do you know what machine is what?</strong>The standard we use for Production Virtual Machine naming is as follows&#58;<br>
<br>
<strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;NetBIOSName-ServiceName<br>
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</strong>For example&#58; <strong>Falcon-SCVMM<br>
</strong><br>
The standard we use for Development Virtual Machine naming is as follows&#58;<br>
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<strong>DEV-NetBIOSName-ServiceName-DeveloperInitials<br>
</strong><br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For example&#58;&#160;<strong>DEV-demo2010a-SP2010MSInfoWorker-JL</strong><br>
