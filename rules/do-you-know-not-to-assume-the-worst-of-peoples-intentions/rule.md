<span class='intro'> ​​Don’t start thinking that some conspiracy is beg\hind someone's actions.<br><br>American writer William James (born 1842) said&#58;<div><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">&quot;Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity&quot;</p><br><br>Brian Harry (in 2018) said something similar in&#160;Giving feedback&#58;<br><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">&quot;I’ve observed that humans have an inherent tendency to want to ascribe motive – to determine why someone did something.&quot;<br></p><br>​<br></div> </span>

<p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">“Joe left me out of that important conversation because he was trying to undermine me.”<br></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad"> Bad example&#160;</dd><p>Any time you find yourself filling in the because clause, stop.&#160;You don't know why someone does anything.&#160;That is locked up securely in their head.&#160;When filling in that blank people insert some negative reason that's worse than reality. So, when giving feedback, stick to what you can see.&#160;</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">“Joe, you left me out of that important conversion.&#160; I felt undermined by that.&#160; Why did you do it?”<br></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">​Good example​<br></dd><p>In this example, I articulate exactly what I saw happen, how it made me feel and ask Joe to explain to me why.&#160;Joe may dispute that he left me out – that's fairly factual and we can discuss evidence and Joe can't dispute how I felt, at least not credibly. Try as hard as you can to stick to things you personally observed and stay away from asserting motive.&#160;Have a genuine conversation designed to help you better understand each other’s perspective and what each of you can do better in the future.<br>​<br></p>
