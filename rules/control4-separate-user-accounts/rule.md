<p>​Do you know the importance of using seperate user accounts?​<br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>Each user should use their own account. If users share a single account, and you need to remove their access, you would then have to change the password and inform all other users. If using individual accounts, you only need to disable (or delete) their account.<br></p><p><br></p><p>​<img alt="ManageUser.png" src="/SiteAssets/do-you-add-a-seperate-user-account-for-each-control4-user/ManageUser.png" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;808px;" /><br></p><p><strong>Figure&#58; Use the Customer Portal to add accounts for all&#160;users</strong><br><br></p>
