  <ul>
    <li>Investigation - the reason for the bug or what you have investigated if you cannot figure out the cause, e.g. checked Windows event logs and found nothing helpful </li>
    <li>Solution - how you fixed the bug (code snippet if necessary) </li>
    <li>Current Status - the bug is fixed (screenshot of working application) or not fixed (ask for more detailed information&#160;from the&#160;client)&#160;<br>
