As a sysadmin, triaging support tickets efficiently is crucial for streamlining the ticket management process. 

It is important to have a clear process for triaging tickets, including the fields that need to be populated when a ticket comes in.

In Zendesk, you can create a view for triaging tickets - for example, create a view showing all unsolved tickets that have not been assigned to anyone.

1. Assign the ticket to the right person

* If the ticket is addressed to an individual, the ticket should be assigned to that person.
* If not, assess the ticket's technical requirements and identify the relevant subject matter expert.
