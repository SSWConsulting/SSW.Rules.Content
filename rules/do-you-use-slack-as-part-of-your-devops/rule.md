**Figure: See how Slack can be setup to improve your Devops** 




With all these different tools being used to collect information in your application, a developer will frequently need to visit many different sites to get information like:

* Was the last build successful?
* What version is in production?
* What errors are being triggered on the app?
* Is the server running slow?
* What is James working on?


This is where a tool like Slack comes in handy. It can help your team aggregate this information from many separate sources into one dedicated channel for your project. The other benefits also include a new team member instantly having access to the full history of the channel as well so no conversations are lost.

At SSW we integrate Slack with:

* Octopus Deploy
* RayGun.io
* TeamCity
* Visual Studio


Even better, you can create bots in slack to manage things like deployments and updating release notes.
