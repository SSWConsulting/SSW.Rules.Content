   <strong>Figure&#58; See how Slack can be setup to improve your Devops</strong><br></div><div>
   <br>
</div>With all these different tools being used to collect information in your application, a developer will frequently need to visit many different sites to get information like&#58;<div><ul><li>
         <span style="line-height&#58;19.5px;">Was the last build successful?<br></span></li><li>
         <span style="line-height&#58;19.5px;">What version is in production?</span></li><li>
         <span style="line-height&#58;19.5px;">What errors are being triggered on the app?</span></li><li>
         <span style="line-height&#58;19.5px;">Is the server running slow?</span></li><li>
         <span style="line-height&#58;19.5px;">What is James working on?</span></li></ul><div>This is where a tool like Slack comes in handy. It can help your team aggregate this information from many separate sources into one dedicated channel for your project. The other benefits also include a new team member instantly having access to the full history of the channel as well so no conversations are lost.<br></div></div> <br> </span>

<p>​​At SSW we integrate Slack with&#58;</p><ul><li>Octopus Deploy<br></li><li>RayGun.io&#160;</li><li>TeamCity</li><li>Visual Studio</li></ul><p>Even better, you can create bots in slack to manage things like deployments and updating release notes.</p>
