You may know that it is quite easy to sort view by a column through the UI.

![Figure: Change view column sort from web UI](SortInView.png)

But when you are trying to do that via code, you may find a pretty tricky issue.

<!--endintro-->

You can use some code like:

```sql
view.Query = "<OrderBy><FieldRef Name=\"Modified\" Ascending=\" FALSE \" /></OrderBy>";
```

**Figure: Use code to change view sort**

But the below code won't work:

```sql
view.Query = "<OrderBy><FieldRef Name=\"Modified\" Ascending=\" False \" /></OrderBy>";
```

::: bad
Bad example - The Ascending attribute is case-sensitive

The full code should be some code like:

```sql
SPView view = list.DefaultView;
view.Query = "<OrderBy><FieldRef Name=\"Modified\" Ascending=\" FALSE \" /></OrderBy>";
view.Update();
```

::: good
Good example - The Ascending attribute is using capital charactors as it is case-sensitive
