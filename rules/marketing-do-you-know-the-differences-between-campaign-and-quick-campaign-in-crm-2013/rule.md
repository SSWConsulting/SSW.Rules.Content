![Figure: Campaign VS Quick Campaign flowchart.](CampaignVSQuickCampaign.jpg)  

A Campaign can extend over a long period of time, with potentially multiple different media types being used for a common purpose. It has extensive meta-data to both plan activities and then show reports on results. e.g.

* A monthly newsletter
* A flyer campaign
* A cold-calling campaign


A Quick Campaign, however, is for a one-off distribution of emails to a targeted group of contacts. e.g.

* Letting your local clients know about an upcoming event by email
