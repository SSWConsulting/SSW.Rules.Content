<span class='intro'> <p>
                    It is extremely important to maintain honesty in a team environment. Nothing breaks
                    down a team like a lack of trust. Remember, honesty starts with the small things.

                    &quot;Lying is all about intent. When you say something you know isn't true in order
                    to influence others, you're lying. If you say something which isn't true but you
                    didn't know it wasn't true, that's not lying. But if you try to influence others
                    by passing off something you don't know is true as truth, you are lying. Even if
                    it subsequently turns out the thing was true.&quot;
