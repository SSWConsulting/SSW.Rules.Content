With automatically sent backlog emails (Azure DevOps or GitHub), there is a risk of people deleting them without reading the content – it doesn't happen with manual emails that have unique subjects and a real person as the sender.

<!--endintro-->

If you have an important PBI and want to improve its visibility, then duplicate the content of the PBI into an email.

### Hi Gary

We want to have a visual reference for how many approvals each admin have in SugarLearning.
E.g. my&#46;sugarlearning&#46;com/SSW/leaderboard-admin/all

1. Please create an “Admin Leaderboard” that will show how many each of the Admin user approved (overtime, per year, and per month)?
