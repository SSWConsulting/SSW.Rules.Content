When it comes to making significant alterations or deletions to someone else's content, it's a good practice to inform them and document it, by sending an ["as per our conversation email"](/as-per-our-conversation-emails) as a [safety step](/safety-step-when-deleting-content).

Clear communication helps maintain transparency and respect for the original author's work.

This is especially important in collaborative environments, where changes can impact the overall project or its documentation. Keeping others informed allows for discussions or adjustments if needed.

Understanding the history of content is essential for context, accuracy, and informed decision-making.

Being diligent about content deletion not only respects contributions but also mitigates risks and fosters a culture of understanding and problem-solving.

Q: What if your team already does Daily Scrums?

A: Prior to the Daily Scrum, ping Dave and say "Starting our Daily Scrum in a minute". Do your Daily Scrum as normal and add in Dave/Product Owner. 
After the call, one person (called the Scribe) should send an email to the whole team.
