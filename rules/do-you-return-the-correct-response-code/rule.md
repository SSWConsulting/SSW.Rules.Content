The use of correct response codes is a simple yet crucial step towards building a better WebAPI. In ASP.NET Core, by default the WebAPI framework sets the response status code to 200 (OK), regardless of whether the task succeed or an error occurred.

You can  **save yourself countless hours of painful debugging** , by specifying the correct response code.

<!--endintro-->

For example: According to the HTTP/1.1 protocol, when a POST request results in the creation of a resource, the server should reply with status 201 (Created).



```
public Product PostProduct(Product item)
 {
 item = repository.Add(item);
 return item;
 }
```


Figure: Bad Example – By default a 200 status code is returned.


```
[ResponseType(typeof(CreditSnapshot))]
 public HttpResponseMessage PostProduct(Product item)
 {
 item = repository.Add(item);
 var response = Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.Created, item);
 
         
 return response;
 }
```


Figure: Good Example – When creating objects the “Created” status code is returned. 


```
public void PutProduct(int id, Product product)

{

    product.Id = id;

    if (!repository.Update(product))

    {

        return Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.NotFound, ex.Message);

    }

}
```


Figure: Good Example – When updating or deleting objects, if the object to be modified cannot be found throw exception with HttpStatusCode.NotFound
