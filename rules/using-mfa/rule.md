The best protection you can provide for your password is to not solely rely on it. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) lets you use a mix of techniques when logging into an account. Typically this is made up of something you know (your password) and something you have (your phone, or an RSA token for those of us still using them).

Your phone can provide a second factor either through an installed authenticator app, or by receiving an SMS with a one-time password.

We are now seeing something you are thrown into the mix too, in the from of biometric security for facial recognition, fingerprint reading, or in more advanced scenarios palm-vein scanning (and plenty of others too). While biometrics offer convenience and reduce our reliance on passwords, they usually replace username and password altogether (although rely on accounts that use them behind the scenes), rather than providing an additional factor (e.g., username + password + fingerprint).

Nearly any service you use now will support MFA, either through an authenticator app, SMS or even email if you have no other option. Ensure that it is enabled for everything you use.
