In today's digital landscape, the importance of robust email backup solutions cannot be overstated. Regular and efficient backups are essential, not just when an employee departs from the company, but on a daily basis to ensure data integrity and continuity. If you are using Microsoft's Exchange Online solution for your emails, these are some options for you.

### Exporting PSTs Manually via Microsoft Purview

Waiting until an employee leaves the company and then manually exporting their PST files to a file server is inefficient and risky. This method is time-consuming, prone to errors, and does not guarantee data integrity or easy accessibility.
While [Microsoft Purview's Compliance center](https://compliance.microsoft.com/contentsearchv2) is good and allows you to export and search a lot, it's not the recommended way to back up your emails.
