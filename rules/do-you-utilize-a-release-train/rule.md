## What is a Release Train Engineer (RTE)?

A Release Train Engineer (RTE) is a servant leader and coach for an Agile Release Train (ART). The RTE's major responsibilities are to facilitate the ART events and processes and assist the teams in delivering value.

### Benefits of Utilizing an RTE

- **Synchronization**: RTE ensures that all the teams on the train are in sync and aligned with the trainâ€™s mission.
- **Facilitation**: Helps in facilitating program-level processes and execution.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Acts as a mediator to resolve conflicts between different teams or within teams.
