Having a powerful domain name is a key asset in establishing a strong online presence. A well-chosen domain not only reflects your brand's identity but also enhances credibility, improves search engine rankings, and increases the likelihood of attracting your target audience. A powerful domain can set you apart from competitors, drive traffic, and help build lasting trust with visitors.

* **Using exact word match** - Using keywords that closely match your product or service in your domain name can be beneficial for SEO and user understanding. However, it's essential to strike a balance between relevance and the natural flow of the domain name. Example: if you search for the word car, it’s more likely that the first search result will have “car” on it
* **Maintaining the website's seniority** - Older domains may have more authority and trust with search engines. Newer domains can still perform well but may need more time to establish authority
* **Avoiding dashes** - Avoiding hyphens in your domain name is generally a good practice because it can make the domain easier to remember and type. Additionally, domains without hyphens often appear cleaner and more professional
* **Register for long term** - Committing to a longer registration term can offer [strategic advantages for businesses and individuals](/register-your-domain-for-a-long-time) alike.
* **Using auto-renewal** - Setting the domain to auto-renew is a smart practice to ensure you don't accidentally lose control of your domain due to expiration. Don’t be like Australian PM Scott Morrison [who lost control of his domain name](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/pm-s-website-taken-over-by-troll-plays-loop-of-scotty-doesn-t-know) to a prankster
