This is not one of the main ones, but still relevant. Your domain name is important!

Here are a few things:

<!--endintro-->

- **Using exact word match** - Using keywords that closely match your product or service in your domain name can be beneficial for SEO and user understanding. However, it's essential to strike a balance between relevance and the natural flow of the domain name. Example: if you search for the word car, it’s more likely that the first search result will have “car” on it.
- **Maintaining the website's seniority** - Older domains may have more authority and trust with search engines. Newer domains can still perform well but may need more time to establish authority.
- **Avoiding dashes** - Avoiding hyphens in your domain name is generally a good practice because it can make the domain easier to remember and type. Additionally, domains without hyphens often appear cleaner and more professional.
- **Using auto-renewal** - Setting the domain to auto-renew is a smart practice to ensure you don't accidentally lose control of your domain due to expiration. Don’t be like Australian PM Scott Morrison [who lost control of his domain name](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/pm-s-website-taken-over-by-troll-plays-loop-of-scotty-doesn-t-know) to a prankster.
