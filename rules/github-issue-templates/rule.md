GitHub Issues offer a great way of raising Issues within projects. However, it can be difficult to distinguish whether the Issue is a **bug**, **feature request** or just a **question**. GitHub Issue Templates should be used to help standardize Issues and ensure they have enough information for a developer to start work.

The templates also make it easy for people to write good quality issues, increasing the chance of getting good feedback and suggestions from users.

Let's take a look at how implementing Issue Templates can improve repository backlogs...

## GitHub Issue Forms

You can take this a step further by creating Issue Forms - these are awesome for non-technical people who aren't comfortable with Markdown.

Check it out on [GitHub Issue Forms docs](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-issue-forms)
