<span class='intro'> ​​Treat clients the same way you would treat a prospective partner - that is, with lots of TLC. Think about your first conversation with a nice girl/guy. You have two approaches you could try. 
<br> </span>


  <p>The first kind of approach is where you try and seal the whole deal in one go&#58; </p><p class="greyBox">&quot;I think we would work well together, would you like to get married and have two children?&quot;</p>
<p>The likely response would be&#58; </p><p class="greyBox">&quot;Get lost you loser.&quot;</p>
<p>The second and more appropriate approach would be to ask something like&#58; </p><p class="greyBox">​&quot;Would you like to have coffee together?&quot;</p>
<p>You have a greater chance that&#160;your prospective partner will say&#58;</p><p class="greyBox">&quot;yes...&quot;<br></p>
<p>Unless you are a great salesperson, who has constant exposure to new clients, then I suggest you use the 2nd approach. Clients are likely to be frightened off with huge quotations from vendors that they&#160;have not got trust in, so avoid this by segmenting the project into smaller projects. It reduces the risk for the client.</p>
<p>For example&#58;</p>
<div>
<p class="greyBox">Thanks for this initial meeting. I will&#160;now go and prepare a proposal for you. <br>(You then do the proposal for free, and include a series of release plans costing $100K)</p>
</div>
<dl> <dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad">Figure&#58; Bad Example - asking a client to get married after the first date. This is likely to be too big a figure for them to risk on for their first taste of your work </dd> </dl>
<div>
<p class="greyBox">Thanks for this initial meeting. There are two options to consider for the next step&#58;<br>1) We could do detailed Specification Review, which is a commitment of 5 days with&#160;2 developers, or<br>2) We could do brief Specification Review, which is a smaller commitment of 2 days with&#160;2 developers&#160;<br></p>
</div>
<dl> <dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Figure&#58; Good Example - a client is more likely to appreciate this approach, they get a choice + they are given an option of proceeding with a small project. There are prospects of continuing the relationship based on how well the previous project goes </dd> </dl>
