<span class='intro'> <p>To visualize the structure of all your code you need architecture tools that will analyse your whole solution.<br></p>
<p>They show the dependencies between classes and assemblies in your projects.&#160;You have 2 choices&#58;</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio's Dependency Graph. This feature is only available in Visual Studio Ultimate. (recommended)</li>
<li>If you want architecture tools for Visual Studio, but don't have Visual Studio Ultimate, then the excellent 3rd party solution nDepend. A bonus is that it can also find issues and highlights them in red for easy discovery<br></li>
</ul>
