<span class='intro'> <p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">The goal is to have a presenter give the editor zero cuts. Editors should inform the speaker when they have to clean up their presentation in post-production (and you think they would likely make the same mistake again next time).<br></p> </span>

<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​​When the editor hits an issue, talk to the speaker, show them the problem and make them practice doing the right way until you give them a 'pass'.</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Now you can hope they won't do it next time, and you won't need to do an edit.​​<br></p>
