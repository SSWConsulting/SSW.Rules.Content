<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​​​​Receiving positive feedback makes everyone feel good, peps them up, and encourages them to do more of whatever they are doing.<br>Forgetting to recognize success
                    means they have​ no motivation to succeed.

<p> This is a simple rule - if someone goes beyond the call of duty, you thank them.​​​<br></p><p>
   <b>Bonus:</b> If you want to go further, you can tweet the link where you've found help from. </p><p>
   <b>Tip:</b> Elaborate your text and avoid adding URLs as it may look like spam.<br></p><dl class="image"><dt>
