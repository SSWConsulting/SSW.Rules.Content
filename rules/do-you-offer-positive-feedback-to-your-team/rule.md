Receiving positive feedback makes everyone feel good, peps them up, and encourages them to do more of whatever they are doing.
Forgetting to recognize success means they have no motivation to succeed.

This is a simple rule - if someone goes beyond the call of duty, you thank them.

**Bonus:** If you want to go further, you can tweet the link where you've found help from.

**Tip:** Elaborate your text and avoid adding URLs as it may look like spam.
