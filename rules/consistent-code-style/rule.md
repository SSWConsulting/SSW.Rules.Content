It's important that the code in a project is kept consistent. This is hard to do when you have developers working in different environments.

Using a _.editorconfig_ file is the best way to manage this.

<!--endintro-->

See the [EditorConfig file specification](https://spec.editorconfig.org)

Most IDEs will automatically find and use a _.editorconfig_ file to format code.

See [Keep your code clean, automatically!](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-17-1-preview-2-is-now-available/#keep-your-code-clean-automatically).

## Creating **.editorconfig** files

**In VS 2022**

2. Search for "EditorConfig"
3. Select a config file depending on your project

**Manually**

1. Create a new file called _.editorconfig_ at the root of your project
2. Add styling rules based on your needs

## Ensuring compliance

To ensure your team is following this standard, you can add it to your [Definition of Done](/definition-of-done).

Additionally, you can have a PR check that enforces _.editorconfig_ rules, but its always better to do this locally.
