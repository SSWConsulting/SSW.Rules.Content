It's important that the code in a project is kept consistent. This is hard to do when you have developers working in different environments. 

Using a .editorconfig file is the best way to manage this.

<!--endintro-->

The EditorConfig file specification is defined here https://editorconfig-specification.readthedocs.io/

Most IDEs will automatically find and use a .editorconfig file to format code.
