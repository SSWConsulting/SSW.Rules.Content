No "UI" in event names, the event raiser should be unaware of the UI in MVVM and user controls
The handler of the event should then do something on the UI.

<!--endintro-->

```csharp
private void RaiseUIUpdateBidButtonsRed() {
  if (UIUpdateBidButtonsRed != null) {
    UIUpdateBidButtonsRed();
  }
}
```

::: bad
Bad example: Avoid "UI" in event names, an event is UI un-aware
:::

```csharp
private void RaiseSelectedLotUpdated() {
  if (SelectedLotUpdated != null) {
    SelectedLotUpdated();
  }
}
```

::: good
Good example: When receiving an update on the currently selected item, change the UI correspondingly (or even better: use MVVM and data binding)
