No "UI" in event names, the event raiser should be unaware of the UI in MVVM and user controls
The handler of the event should then do something on the UI. 

<!--endintro-->



```
private void RaiseUIUpdateBidButtonsRed()
{
if (UIUpdateBidButtonsRed != null)
{
UIUpdateBidButtonsRed();
}
}
```




::: bad
Bad Code: Avoid "UI" in event names, an event is UI un-aware  
:::





```
private void RaiseSelectedLotUpdated()
{
if (SelectedLotUpdated != null)
{
SelectedLotUpdated();
}
}
```




::: good
Good Code: We received an update on the currently selected item, change the UI correspondingly (or even better: use MVVM and data binding)
