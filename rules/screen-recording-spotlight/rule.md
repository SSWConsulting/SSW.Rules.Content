Tools like ZoomIt from the Sysinternals suite let you **enlarge**, **pan**, and **draw** while recording the screen so viewers never lose track of what matters. They are quick to set up, work with any recorder, and help you avoid redoing takes because people missed a cursor movement.

## Windows

Follow these steps before you hit record:

* Install ZoomIt from [Microsoft Sysinternals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/zoomit) and pin it
* Set shortcuts for zooming, drawing, and clearing the screen in the "Options" dialog, then practice the flow before your session
* Use the tool to spotlight the key fields, buttons, or hotkeys you reference, especially when you are producing a [Done Video](/done-video)
* Finish each segment by clearing annotations so the next step starts clean

This habit keeps the audience engaged, reduces editing, and makes your recording align with the clarity expected in a video recording.

## What about Mac users

If you record on macOS, try [Brilliant](https://try-brilliant.com/) to zoom, annotate, and script actions while capturing the screen. It delivers the same clarity benefits as ZoomIt and adds automation to speed up repeat recordings.

See [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/brilliant) install command:

``` bash
brew install --cask brilliant
```
