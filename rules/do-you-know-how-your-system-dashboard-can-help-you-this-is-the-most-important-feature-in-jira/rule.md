  <p dir="ltr" style="margin-right&#58;0px;">The dashboard consists of a number of portlets configured by the Jira Administrator so they can be changed.&#160; You can also take a copy of the System Dashboard and modify it, name it and then share it with others.&#160; See the page on the SysAdmin dashboard.&#160; Portlets often use Filters to display their contents.&#160; Filters are also user-definable and shareable.&#160; You can search on dashboards and filters and put any of them into your favourites.<br>
<br>
The System Dashbaord has two columns and&#160;three main &quot;areas&quot;; these areas only appear if they are relvant to you as a user and have have current content.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Issues requiring your immediate attention </li>
    <li>Reported Issues </li>
    <li>Assigned Issues </li>
</ol>
<p>It will also show your Favourite Filters which are very useful.<br>
