<span class='intro'> It is not a good idea to have Windows Update automatically updating your servers.&#160; There are a few reasons. 
<br><br> </span>

<ol><li>The hotfix could bring down a production environment. (This issue previously happened)<br></li><li>In fact, even in a development environment, this could be hours of lost work as the development team struggles to understand why only 
      <strong>some</strong> of the developers' servers&#160;<strong>magically and mysteriously </strong>broke overnight.<br></li><li>Windows Update could restart your server, or put your server in a state where it requires restarting - preventing any urgent MSI installs without bringing down the server.</li></ol><p>Windows Update remains the best thing for end-users to protect their systems.&#160; But in a server, especially a production server environment - Windows Update patches are just like any new versions of the software that's built internally.&#160; It should be tested and then deployed in a controlled manner.<br> 
   <br>So recommendations for managing updates are as follows&#58;</p><ol><li>Use WSUS to approve/deny updates for your servers.<br></li><li>Update Staging/Development servers first to see if any issues arise from the updates.<br></li><li>Roll these updates out to Production once confident there are no issues​.<br></li><li>Windows Updates may be critical and should be kept relatively up to date.</li><li>Do all of this on a schedule - have an email sent to your SysAdmins to remind them to review and reboot needed machines&#58;</li></ol><dl class="goodImage"><dt><img src="WSUSReport.png" alt="WSUSReport.png" style="width&#58;750px;" />
   </dt><dd>Good Example&#58; Scheduled email showing clear action points and WSUS stats<br></dd>
