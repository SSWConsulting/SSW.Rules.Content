<span class='intro'> <p>It is hard to keep track of your PPC spending in your head when you are constantly adjusting spends for multiple campaigns. At SSW we have multiple campaigns running on a weekly basis. Sometimes we adjust the spend on a campaign for a week to test out a new lead generation tactic to see if we can get a lower cost per conversion.</p> </span>

<p></p><p>SSW has a daily budget to spend on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google AdWords​ and Bing. At times we swap the budget from one platform to another to increase our conversions if the campaign is doing exceptionally well.</p><p>The best way to keep track of the monthly spend and make sure we don't go over our budget for the month is to send a weekly update in excel to the stakeholders.​</p><p>You can download a version of the excel template at&#160;<a href="/AnalyticsReports/Campaign%20PPC%20Spend.xlsx"><img class="ms-asset-icon ms-rtePosition-4" src="/_layouts/15/images/icxlsx.png" alt="" />Campaign PPC Spend.xlsx</a></p>
