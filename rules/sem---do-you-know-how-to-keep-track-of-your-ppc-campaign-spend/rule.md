<span class='intro'> <p>It is hard to keep track of your PPC spending in your head when you are constantly adjusting spends for multiple campaigns. At SSW we have multiple campaigns running on a weekly basis. Sometimes we adjust the spend on a campaign for a week to test out a new lead generation tactic to see if we can get a lower cost per conversion.</p> </span>

<p>&#160;</p><p>SSW has a daily budget to spend on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google AdWords​ and Bing. At times we swap the budget from one platform to another to increase our conversions if the campaign is doing exceptionally well.</p><p>The best way to keep track of the monthly spend and make sure we don't go over our budget for the month is to hold a weekly meeting every Monday. The following spreadsheet &#160;<a href="/AnalyticsReports/Campaign%20PPC%20Spend.xlsx"><img class="ms-asset-icon ms-rtePosition-4" src="/_layouts/15/images/icxlsx.png" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;" />Campaign PPC Spend.xlsx</a>&#160;should be prepared before the meeting for stakeholders to review. </p><p>During the meeting we cover the following&#58;</p><ol><li>The spend for the last week</li><li>The spend for the upcoming week</li></ol><p>At the end of the meeting the spreadsheet is emailed to the stakeholders. The email should contain&#58;</p><ol><li>The amount be spent on each campaign on each platform</li><li>A link to the spreadsheet on your internal intranet (hopefully SharePoint &#58;-))</li></ol><p>&#160;</p>
