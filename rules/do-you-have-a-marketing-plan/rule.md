<p>​If you were going to build a house, you would hope that the architect and builders were working together using architectural plans and blueprints as their guide. So why would trying to build a solid customer base or market share be any different?<br></p>
<p>At SSW we realize the monumental importance of a marketing plan. Although we recognize that in many cases marketing plans get filed away in the closet until it's time to get a business loan, they're most effective when they act as a blueprint for all the marketing activities a company undertakes.<br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>Here are some of the important points to consider in a marketing plan&#58;<br></p><ul><li>Set&#160;out your marketing goals and objectives then align them with your overall business goals and strategy</li><li>Set&#160;out a time frame for achieving those goals<br></li><li>Identify&#160;a target market and segmentation strategy</li><li>Define how you will position and differentiate your product</li><li>Use competitor and industry analysis<br></li><li>Identify&#160;current and proposed marketing methods</li><li>Include marketing reports (historical and forecasts)&#160;</li><li>Set&#160;the criteria against which the plan will be assessed for success or failure</li></ul>
<p>The most important thing to remember about a marketing plan is that it is a work in progress.&#160;Always needing to be reassessed and changed to adapt to the dynamic business environment.</p>
