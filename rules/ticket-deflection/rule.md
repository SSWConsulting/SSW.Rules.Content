Providing your clients a personal service is really important, but it's expensive. Great deflected tickets give a more consistent experience and quicker experience, plus they are cheaper compared with support personnel. <br>

<p>
   <strong>Step 1:</strong> You should find the most common requests and make sure they can be deflected by creating FAQs or blog posts.</p><p>This way you help your users to access the information they need and help themselves before submitting a ticket, avoiding the contact with your support team.</p><p>
   <strong>Step 2:</strong> Use a ticket system that supports deflected tickets. Zendesk is the leading solution with deflected tickets. ServiceNow is another good one.
