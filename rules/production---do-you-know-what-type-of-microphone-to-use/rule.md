<p>Shotgun Microphones are, by definition, built to capture the audio from what they are pointing directly&#160;towards. They are actually built to cut out audio from any other direction. This means that if someone behind the microphone says something, it will likely not be picked up, or only the bass will be picked up and the sound will be distorted.</p>
