<span class='intro'> ​Adding texts to your videos can be very helpful to secure ​information in viewers minds. You must make sure the text is on the screen&#160;enough time for all readers to read it until the end. You don't want comments like &quot;Leave more time for text, almost all of them I didn’t have time to read&quot;. <br> </span>

<p>​The questions is &quot;How long is enough?&quot;&#160;<br></p><p>As a starting point, a&#160;safe way to measure is to&#160;leave it on screen long enough to be&#160;read at least 2&#160;times (Assuming slow readers read at 200 ​words per minute).&#160;<br>&#160;<br>Depending on the complexity of the text, either way&#160;can be excessive or maybe&#160;too fast, but most times it will give you a good idea of how long you should keep a text on your video.<br>&#160;<br>Another way to calculate durations is by using average reading speeds per word and adjust duration according to the number of words.&#160; A calculator is available at&#160;<a href="https&#58;//www.omnicalculator.com/everyday-life/words-per-minute">Omni Calculator</a>.&#160;While appropriate for some types of productions, in general, this can become too time-consuming.<br><br></p><p>See some examples&#58;<br></p><div class="ms-rtestate-read ms-rte-embedcode ms-rte-embedil ms-rtestate-notify" unselectable="on"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https&#58;//www.youtube.com/embed/ADse_lj3_ZI" frameborder="0"></iframe>&#160;</div><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad">​Figure&#58; Bad Example - Video title is too short, does not give viewers enough time to read on-screen&#160;text.</dd><p><br>&#160;&#160;<br></p><div class="ms-rtestate-read ms-rte-embedcode ms-rte-embedil ms-rtestate-notify"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https&#58;//www.youtube.com/embed/3Vz08yF6kHs" frameborder="0"></iframe>&#160;</div><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad">​Figure&#58; Bad Example -&#160;Video title is too long, stays on screen for too long and become distracting once read.</dd><p><br></p><div class="ms-rtestate-read ms-rte-embedcode ms-rte-embedil ms-rtestate-notify"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https&#58;//www.youtube.com/embed/vdRH-GZiO3M" frameborder="0"></iframe>&#160;</div><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">​Figure&#58; Good Example -&#160;Video Title duration is perfectly timed and can be read twice through.
