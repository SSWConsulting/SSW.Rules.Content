The start point of your branding is the logo. From there everything the company produces or owns should "feel" like it comes from your company. When you walk by a pile of documents on a desk, you should recognize that it's from your company. It's not just plonking the logo everywhere.

These are things to keep in mind for good branding:

* **Logo** - E.g. [SSW Logo](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/logo/ssw/)

* **[Websites](/rules-to-better-websites-branding-and-marketing)** - E.g. [SSW Web Reference](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/company/Web-Reference.aspx) page is an example of good branding instructions for websites
