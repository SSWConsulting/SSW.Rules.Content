Imagine you're browsing a website. You come across an area on the page that seems oddly blank, only to realize it's a white image blending seamlessly into the white background. This disrupts the browsing experience. So how do you prevent that?

## The Importance of Image Borders

Making your images distinct is a key part of creating a user-friendly website. You should add borders to images, especially those with a white or light-colored background.

* **Visibility**: A border makes the image stand out, even if the website's background color matches the image's color.
* **Professionalism**: Borders can add a sense of completeness to your site's design.
