There are many scenarios where you need some extra space in a web page. No matter which one you are at, CSS is the answer.

<!--endintro-->

Sometimes the first thing that comes to the developer mind is to use the "break line" tag `<br />`, or the [ASCII character codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) for "space" `&#160;` / `&nbsp;` to create these extra spaces. **It's wrong!**

CSS is the way to go. You can use both "margin" or "padding" CSS properties to get the result you want.

```html
<ul>
  <li>&#160;&#160;&#160;List item</li>
</ul>
```

Figure: Bad example - Using the "space" ASCII character to create a padding on that list

```html
<ul>
  <li>List item</li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
<br />
```

::: info
**Note:** If you **cannot** use CSS to create some breathing space, using `<br />` maybe acceptable as last resort for better readability.
:::

```css
ul {
  margin-bottom: 15px;
}
ul li {
  padding-left: 10px;
}
```

**Tip:** You might be not familiar with editing a CSS file... In this case, contact a designer, they will be more than happy to help you.
