To detect and mitigate a cyber attack, the right set of events need to be collected from your domain controllers.Â The audit policy is a compromise between collecting too many and too few events. Logs are useful for detecting security events, but if there is too much noise, you'll miss the important information.

To enable advanced auditing on your domain controllers, use group policy. The settings are in **Computer Configuration | Windows Settings | Security Settings | Advanced Audit Policy Configuration | Audit Policies.**
