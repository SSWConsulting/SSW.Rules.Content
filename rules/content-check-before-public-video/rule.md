Recording a video is time-consuming — scripting, filming, editing, and reviewing all take effort.  
The biggest waste happens when you record **before** verifying the accuracy of your content.  
A quick **Content Check** before hitting record can save hours of rework and ensure your video is right the first time.

### ⚠️ Problem

You’ve recorded a video — but once it’s ready for edit, someone notices inaccurate content, missing context, or off-brand messaging.\
Now you need to re-record… wasting time ⏳ and effort 🎥.

### 💡 Solution

Before you hit **Record**, do a **Content Check** - a quick content check with a **Subject Matter Expert (SME)** or the **TV/Production Team**.

Think of it like the “[Checked by xxx](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/checked-by-xxx/)” rule, but for public videos.

### 🪜 Steps

1. **Prepare yourself**  

   * Write your talking points, slides, or short script.  
   * Know the key message you want to deliver.
2. **Get a content check**  

   * If it’s a **technical/development topic** → get a **Dev SME** to review.  
   * If it’s a **production, marketing, or client-facing topic** → get a **TV/Production Team** member.  
   * Sometimes, it’s both!

Then setup some time with them to perform your presentation/video in full over a call or in person. This way, you're getting rapid feedback in a 1 on 1 way. Saving you loads of time later down the line.
3. **Ask for feedback early**  

   * Send your draft or slides before recording.  
   * Let the reviewer mark it as **Checked by \[Name]**.
4. **Apply suggestions**  

   * Update your outline before filming.  
   * You’ll save hours of re-edits and extra versions later.
5. **Record with confidence**  

   * You’ve already passed the content check.  
   * Hit Record and share your wonderful knowledge.
