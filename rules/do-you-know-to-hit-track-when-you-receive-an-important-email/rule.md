<span class='intro'> <p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Whenever you email a client with a correspondence that relates to an existing CRM opportunity (i.e. an &quot;as per our conversation&quot; about when you think the project would get going etc.) you should track it in CRM so it is centralized and can be seen by anyone else who tries to follow up that opportunity.</p><div><div></div><div>Now you know how to do it, what activities are worth tracking?​&#160;<a href="/Pages/Track-all-sales-related-activities-in-CRM.aspx">Sales - Do you track all sales related activities in CRM? </a></div><div>​<br></div></div> </span>

 <p>
          The simplest way is, when writing or receiving the email, click the track in CRM
          button in the ribbon and &quot;set regarding&quot; to the opportunity in question.</p>
        <dl class="image">
          <dt>
            <img alt="Ribbon CRM section in email" src="CRMSectionInEmail.jpg" /></dt>
          <dd>
            Figure&#58; When you receive an important email, click the 'Track' button in
            on the CRM toolbar​
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          Otherwise, you can also do it from the main Outlook page with the toolbar at the
          top.</p>
        <dl class="image">
          <dt>
            <img alt="Toolbar CRM section in Inbox" src="CRMSectionInInbox.jpg" /></dt>
          <dd>
            Figure&#58; A shortcut to the same 'Track' button exists on the CRM Toolbar in your Inbox</dd>
        </dl>
