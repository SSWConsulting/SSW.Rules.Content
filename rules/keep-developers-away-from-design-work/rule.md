It’s tempting for companies to blur the lines between design and development roles, especially when resources are limited.  Maintaining a clear distinction between disciplines is crucial for creating cohesive and effective user experiences.

For most developers, especially those early in their careers, the risk of making choices that negatively impact the overall design is too high. When Product Owners delegate design work to developers, they are likely to accumulate accumulate significant UX Debt.

While it’s important to be flexible in real-world situations, particularly when dealing with a low designer-to-developer ratio, it's still wise to keep design work primarily in the hands of designers.

## Streamlining design decisions

Design is an inherently subjective field, and even experienced designers don't always agree on every decision.

Design needs to be approached holistically, meaning every element should be considered as part of the whole. For example, color choices, typography, and user experience should all work together to create a unified design. When too many people, especially those without a design background, get involved, it can result in a disjointed and inconsistent product.

This situation is analogous to designers writing code. Many designers might know some HTML or CSS, and they could even use tools like ChatGPT to generate code. However, without a developer to review and refine this code, the risk of introducing poor-quality code into the system increases. Even if a developer does review it, it adds unnecessary workload, diverting their focus from their primary responsibilities.

::: info
**Note:** Allowing developers to take on design tasks only makes sense when training them to transition into design roles or vice versa, as part of a deliberate learning process. Otherwise, companies should let designers handle design and developers focus on their strengths. This ensures each aspect of a project gets the expertise it needs for better results.
