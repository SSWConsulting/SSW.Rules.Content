With Google's [increased emphasis on local search](https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/10/place-search-faster-easier-way-to-find.html) and [promoting local services](http://www.seobook.com/localization), it is important that companies have a **Google My Business** entry so that their businesses can be found easily in searches.

[Login using your business administrator account](https://www.google.com/intl/en_au/business/) and add your business.

<!--endintro-->

Having a Google My Business entry will allow their entries to display when users search for services in a local area.
