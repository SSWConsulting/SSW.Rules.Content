At the end of the Spec Review encourage the project to go ahead with the current resources, while it is fresh in their heads.

Say words to the effect of:

<!--endintro-->

> "The resources allocated to your project depend on availability. All efforts will be made to allocate the original resources used on the Spec Review, but that cannot be guaranteed.  
> If you decide today or tomorrow, then we can use the same resources...  
> Regardless, it is always better to move ahead while the project is fresh in the developers' heads."
