AI tools like ChatGPT are fantastic for speeding up your work, whether you're drafting emails, reports, LinkedIn posts, or documentation. But while these tools are great at generating content quickly, they’re not always great at *sounding human*. Left unchecked, AI-generated text can come across as overly formal, overly dramatic, or just a bit fake.

**Video: What to check before sending AI-written content (3 min)**  




Before hitting send, take a minute to review the content ChatGPT gave you. It can save you from sounding robotic.


Here are the most common issues to watch out for:


## Overly Formal Tone


AI often leans toward formality, making everyday points sound like a lawyer or English literature. This can feel unnatural, especially in a casual email or chat.


::: greybox 
Common examples:
- “plays a vital role”
- “holds significant importance”
- “a crucial influence”
- “a profound heritage”
:::
::: bad  
Bad Example – These phrases sound heavy-handed for most day-to-day writing  
:::


Instead, use simpler alternatives that sound more like what you'd say in conversation.


## Too Many Adjectives and Adverbs


AI sometimes slips into writing that sounds like an ad, even when you’re not selling anything. This usually means lots of positive adjectives with no real facts.


::: greybox 
Typical AI phrases include:
- “continues to captivate”
- “boasts a…”
- “seamlessly connecting…”
- “value-driven experiences…”
:::
::: bad  
Bad Example – Sounds polished, but it’s just fluff with no substance  
:::


Stick to facts. If something is great, show *why* it’s great, don’t just say it is.


## Unnecessary Drama or Parallelisms


AI loves to add contrast for dramatic effect, even though it isn’t needed. 


::: greybox  
Common AI patterns include:  
- “It’s not just X—it’s Y.”  
- “Not only… but also…”  
- “However…” (followed by a sweeping generalization)  
:::
::: bad  
Bad Example – Overuse of dramatic structures makes writing feel artificial or emotionally loaded  
:::






## Fake or Vague Analysis


AI can invent explanations that *sound* deep, but actually say nothing. 


::: greybox
Phrases like:
- “highlighting…”
- “emphasizing…”
- “underscoring…”
- “contributing to…”
:::
::: bad  
Bad Example – Sounds analytical, but adds no real value or evidence  
:::


If AI adds analysis, ask yourself: *Is this actually true? Do I have evidence for this?* If not, cut it.


## Too Many Emojis (⭐🤖🤖😒)


AI sometimes adds emojis to make text feel friendly or informal, but in professional writing, this can come across as unpolished or even inappropriate. 


While emojis are fine in casual chats, they don’t belong in emails, reports, or documents intended for clients, managers, or stakeholders. They can reduce the credibility of your message and make serious topics seem trivial.

Don't overuse Emojis 😉


## Too Many Em Dashes (—)


AI uses em dashes excessively. Humans usually prefer commas or parentheses in most cases.

### Final Tips


✅ **Keep the good stuff.** AI often produces solid drafts and saves time.  
🚫 **Don't blindly copy and paste.** Review tone, phrasing, and accuracy first.  
🔍 **Ask yourself: “Would I say it this way?”** If not, rewrite it.


By taking the time to edit AI's output, you'll sound more authentic, approachable, and clear.
