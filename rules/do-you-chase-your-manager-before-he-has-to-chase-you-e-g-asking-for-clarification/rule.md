<p>Managers (or clients), like all of us, are snowed under with work and won't always be able to respond to your emails in a timely manner. But keeping a good line of communication open is essential and it's up to you to make it happen. No matter whether your weekly meeting gets canceled or your client&#160;appears to avoid you for the week, stop and talk to them in the corridor, or pick up the phone and give them an update. <br></p>
<p>If you know you've got issues to discuss (such as looming deadlines), don't wait for the client or your manager to bring it up, take a pro-active approach and schedule a meeting.</p>

<p>As a guideline, you should not go more than 2 weeks without talking to your boss. And don't forget all the things you've got to say - have a sub-folder in your Inbox such as &quot;Ask the Boss&quot;. Next time when the boss asks &quot;does anyone want to speak to me?&quot;, look in that folder.</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox"> What do you mean?<br><br>Uly</p>
