In addition to being useful for [providing travel insurance](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=b2eba7cc-d2db-498d-b354-3e0c32bea0e5), some credit cards come with additional travel benefits. 


<!--endintro-->
 For example, the Qantas American Express card comes with $450 of Qantas travel credit each year, which completely offsets the $450 annual fee. To take advantage of this offer, the cardholder can simply call the number on the back of their card and follow the prompts.

Other advantages of this card include free access to a Qantas lounge twice a year, and accrual of Qantas points on everyday purchases. 


If you have an airline-affiliated credit card, it's always worth digging into the benefits - you never know how much you could be saving.
