Tracking your spending in Google Ads is essential. You can assign a daily budget to each individual campaign, or use shared budgets across multiple campaigns.

<!--endintro-->

A shared budget is ideal if you don’t want to time monitoring multiple individual campaigns but would still like to get the most clicks possible with your budget in mind.

These are some steps to follow to ensure the budget is being spent effectively:

1. Once a week, ensure campaigns are not overspending!
2. Go to **ads.google.com | Tools and Settings | Shared Library | Shared Budgets**  
   Once there, check to see which campaigns are limited by budget, underspending, or performing well

**Note:** If campaigns are performing well, it’s a good idea to increase the budget and continue to measure results.
