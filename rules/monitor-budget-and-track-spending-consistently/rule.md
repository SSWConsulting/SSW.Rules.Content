Tracking your spending in Google Ads is essential. You can assign a daily budget to each individual campaign, or use shared budgets across multiple campaigns.

<!--endintro-->

Individual budgets are ideal if you have fewer than 10 campaigns so you have utmost control on budget and can maximise performance (larger budgets on fewer campaigns is Google's preference).

These are some steps to follow to ensure the budget is being spent effectively:

1. Once a week, ensure campaigns are not overspending!
2. Go to your campaigns and check what they are spending
   Once there, check to see which campaigns are limited by budget, underspending, or performing well

**Note:** If the campaign seems to be performing, double-check its keywords to see if you're burning budget on engaging but low-converting keywords. If the keywords look good, then it's a good idea to increase the budget and continue measuring results.
