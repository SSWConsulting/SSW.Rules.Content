<p>
          Once you create an opportunity, you should always click the &quot;Follow Up&quot; button to
          create an activity to call up the client after approximately 1 week. Each time you
          make this call, you should complete this activity and create a new one, with a time
          interval based on the specific circumstances of the opportunity.</p>

        <p>
          You can see your outstanding activities in your CRM workspace homepage, and this
          should keep you on top of all of your current opportunities.<br>
          Make sure you never have an opportunity in CRM without a follow up activity against
          it; otherwise you're just hoping that they will remember to call you?never a good
          sales strategy.
