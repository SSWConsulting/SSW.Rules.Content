<span class='intro'> <p>Once you create an opportunity, you should click the &quot;Add phone call&quot; button to
          create an activity to call up the client after approximately 1 week. Each time you
          make this call, you should complete the&#160;activity and create a new one to follow up again when appropriate.</p> </span>

<dl class="image">
          <dt>
            <img alt="Follow Up Activity" src="FollowUpActivity.jpg" style="width&#58;600px;height&#58;572px;" /></dt>

        </dl>
        <p>
          You can see your outstanding activities in your CRM workspace homepage, and this
          should keep you on top of all of your current opportunities.</p><p><span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">Make sure you never have an opportunity in CRM without a follow up activity against
          it; otherwise you're just hoping that they will remember to call you, which is&#160;never a good
          sales strategy.&#160;</span></p><p><span style="line-height&#58;1.6;"><strong>Note&#58; </strong>The alternative to CRM activities is to use </span><a href="/do-you-follow-up-emails-effectively" style="line-height&#58;1.6;">FollowUpThen</a><span style="line-height&#58;1.6;"> instead as this is much&#160;more convenient. The downside is that these&#160;are not centralised, meaning that&#160;​wh​en a salesperson leaves an organisation, their opportunities will need to be handed over manually.</span></p>
