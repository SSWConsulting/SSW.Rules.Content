<p>Once you create an opportunity, you should click the "Add phone call" button to
          create an activity to call up the client after approximately 1 week. Each time you
          make this call, you should complete the activity and create a new one to follow up again when appropriate.</p>

          You can see your outstanding activities in your CRM workspace homepage, and this
          should keep you on top of all of your current opportunities.</p><p><span style="line-height:1.6;">Make sure you never have an opportunity in CRM without a follow up activity against
          it; otherwise you're just hoping that they will remember to call you, which is never a good
          sales strategy. </span></p><p><span style="line-height:1.6;"><strong>Note: </strong>The alternative to CRM activities is to use </span><a href="/do-you-follow-up-emails-effectively" style="line-height:1.6;">FollowUpThen</a><span style="line-height:1.6;"> instead as this is much more convenient. The downside is that these are not centralised, meaning that ​wh​en a salesperson leaves an organisation, their opportunities will need to be handed over manually.</span></p>
