<span class='intro'> <p>First of all, understand that IM is distracting so use it judiciously. However, IM is great when an email is unclear or you have an additional question about the email that is stopping you from sending a 'done'. IM is great for reminding people and is excellent to push the important things... especially for people who ignore emails!</p><p><br>During the course of an IM chat with a client or manager, an action or a piece of work may be required. It's highly important that such chats are copied from the chat and pasted into an email.</p> </span>

For example&#58;<div><br><table cellspacing="0" width="100%" class="ssw15-rteTable-default"><tbody><tr><td class="ssw15-rteTable-default" style="width&#58;100%;">​&quot;As per our IM conversation, I will XXX.&quot;</td></tr></tbody></table><br>When you copy and paste a Skype conversation into an email remember the following&#58;</div><div><br><ol><li><span style="line-height&#58;20px;">Who are you sending the email to? Is there any private information that should not be shared with the group?</span><br></li><li><span style="line-height&#58;20px;">Have you asked for permission to copy the Skype conversation into an email? The other party may not want to share it in an email</span><br></li><li><span style="line-height&#58;20px;">Does the conversation add value to the email or can it be left out?</span><br></li><li><span style="line-height&#58;20px;">If you decide to copy the conversation then make sure you edit it so it is easy to read and relevant</span><br></li></ol></div><div><br>Make it readable by snipping out just the important information and CC relevant parties. (See&#160;rule on Snipping&#160;for more information).</div>
