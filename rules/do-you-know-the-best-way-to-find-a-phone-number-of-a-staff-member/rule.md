Bad way: Use the Global Address List in Active Directory, because you can’t update it from Outlook... Only an administrator can maintain the details\
Note: Good UI as it is easy to find inside outlook

Good way: Use the Dynamics 365 (formerly CRM 2016) toolbar?\
Note: We have a suggestion that Outlook should allow you to put the CRM2016 URL into Tools | Options so this is better integrated
