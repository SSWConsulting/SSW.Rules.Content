An important source of comfort for any client is a feeling that they are in control and they know the basics of what is going on. The fundamental part of this is who is working for them and how much it is costing.

<!--endintro-->

Therefore, if you change the developers on a project or if one or more of their rates change, it is very important to inform the client, before sending them the next invoice, where they will find out and could think that you're being shifty.

We have standard templates for these situations in our intranet shared documents. You can see an example here:

::: email-template
|          |     |
| -------- | --- |
| To:      | {{ CLIENT EMAIL }} |
| Subject: | Notice of change to Scott’s rates|
::: email-content  

### Hi {{ CLIENT NAME }},

As per our conversation, I wanted to let you know that Scott was promoted to Solution Architect earlier this year. We held back his rate change until the end of this phase of the project, but we will be implementing his new rate as of {{ DATE }}.

Please find his new standard rate attached below.

**Scott Smith** 

* Profile: https://ssw.com.au/people/sample 
* Standard Hourly Rate: $305+GST  
* Prepaid Hourly Rate: $290+GST (minimum 40 hours per resource, subject to prepaid terms) 

I trust you've been happy with Scott's contribution to your project so far.

Let me know if you have any questions; always happy to talk.
