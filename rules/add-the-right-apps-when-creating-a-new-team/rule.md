When creating a new Team in Microsoft Teams, you can add Tabs to keep track of important information and you can also add Apps (generally bots) to channels.

Apps enhance your Teams experience in various ways e.g.:

1. Apps can be bots, and you can talk and interact with them
2. Apps can add and change your messages in Teams
3. Apps can also be Tabs, they overlap a little
