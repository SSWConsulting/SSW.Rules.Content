Sometimes the person you send your email to may not reply immediately because they're busy or just may have forgotten about it.  If you need an answer, use a PING by doing the following:  
<!--endintro-->

1. Reply to ALL
2. Put (PING) in 1<sup>st</sup> line of the Body
3. Plus any other instructions - such as "Hurry Up!" or "following-up, and looking forward to your reply" or "Need an answer please"

Of course you might use slightly friendlier language following up a client or a third party compared with following up a colleague! If it's really important and you need an answer you might like to     [consider using the phone instead of email](/Pages/EmailForTasksNotCommunication.aspx).
