Sometimes the person you send your email to may not reply immediately because they're busy or just may have forgotten about it. If you need an answer, remind them by adding a PING to the thread:  
<!--endintro-->

1. Reply to ALL
2. Put (PING) in 1<sup>st</sup> line of the Body
3. Plus any other instructions - such as "Hurry Up!" or "following-up, and looking forward to your reply" or "Need an answer please"

Of course you might use slightly friendlier language following up a client or a third party compared with following up a colleague! If it's really important and you need an answer you might like to [consider using the phone instead of email](/dones-do-you-use-email-for-tasks-only-not-communication).
