Sometimes the person you send your email to may not reply immediately because they're busy or just may have forgotten about it.  If you need an answer, use a PING by doing the following:

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<ol><li>Reply to ALL </li><li>Put (PING) in 1<sup>st</sup> line of the Body </li><li>Plus any other instructions - such as "Hurry Up!" or "following-up, and looking forward to your reply" or "Need an answer please"​</li></ol><dl class="goodImage"><dt> 
      <img src="ping-email.png" alt="Hurry Up" class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" /> 
   </dt><dd>Figure: Good Example - (PING) written at the top of the email.</dd></dl>​ 
<p>Of course you might use slightly friendlier language following up a client or a third party compared with following up a colleague!​ If it's really important and you need an answer you might like to 
   <a href="/Pages/EmailForTasksNotCommunication.aspx">consider using the phone instead of email</a>​.</p>
