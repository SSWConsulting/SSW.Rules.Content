Sometimes the person you send your email to may not reply immediately because they're busy or just may have forgotten about it.&#160; If you need an answer, use a PING by doing the following&#58;

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<ol><li>Reply to ALL </li><li>Put (PING) in 1<sup>st</sup> line of the Body </li><li>Plus any other instructions - such as &quot;Hurry Up!&quot; </li></ol><dl class="goodImage"><dt><img src="/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/PublishingImages/ping-email.png" alt="Hurry Up" class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58;&#160;Good Example - (PING) written at the top of the email.</dd></dl>​
<p>This reminds the other person that you are still waiting for a response.</p>
