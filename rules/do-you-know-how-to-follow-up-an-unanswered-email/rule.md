Sometimes the person you send your email to may not reply immediately because they're busy or just may have forgotten about it.&#160; If you need an answer, use a RESEND by doing the following&#58;

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
    <ol>
        <li>Reply to ALL </li>
        <li>Put (RESEND) in 1<sup>st</sup> line of the Body </li>
        <li>Plus any other instructions - such as &quot;Hurry Up!&quot; </li>
    </ol>
        <img class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" alt="Hurry Up" src="/Standards/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/PublishingImages/HurryUp.gif" /><span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureGood">Figure&#58; This is an example of a RESEND.</span>
    <p>
        This reminds the other person that you are still waiting for a response.</p>
