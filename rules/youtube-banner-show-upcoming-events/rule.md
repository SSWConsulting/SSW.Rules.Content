Imagine a potential client visiting your YouTube channel, eager to engage with your content but unaware of the next big event you're hosting. By not highlighting upcoming events on your banner, you might miss a valuable opportunity to connect with your audience. You never want to miss an opportunity to show the events that you are hosting or sponsoring.

### Why?
* **Engagement and connection**: A visual and current home page creates anticipation and informs your audience about your next event.
* **Professionalism**: A timely and well-designed banner shows commitment to quality and consistency.
* **Relevance**: It keeps your channel relevant and gives viewers a reason to check out your content.

### How?

1. As soon as you confirm an event, you should begin the design process. This could mean sending a task to your designers.
2. Make sure the banner gets approved by the relevant people.
3. Set yourself a reminder to update the banner on the day following the prior event.
Note: If your event is the next one in line, use the new banner as soon as it's ready.
