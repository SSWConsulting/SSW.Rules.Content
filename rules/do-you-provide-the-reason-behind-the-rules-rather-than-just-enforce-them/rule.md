<p></p><p>If you criticize&#160;your staff&#58;</p><ul><li>You don't make lasting changes</li><li>They will resent you, resulting in lower productivity and&#160;employee morale</li></ul>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

                <p>
                    For&#160;example&#58; If one of your responsibilities is to make sure all your developers sent &quot;test please&quot; emails,&#160;you can run around with a lot of authority telling them
                    they'd better comply, but at soon as you're not around, they will resent you and
                    not bother about it.
                </p>
                A better approach is, when you see developers not sending &quot;test please&quot; emails&#58;​<ul>
                    <li>Explain that these emails&#160;are there to make sure we are working on the right thing in the right way</li>
                    <li>Explain that they save time by getting early feedback, allowing bugs to be fixed while it's still fresh in the developers'&#160;minds</li>
                </ul>
