                    they'd better comply, but at soon as you're not around, they will resent you and
                    not bother about it.</p><p><span style="line-height&#58;20px;">A better approach is, when you see developers not sending &quot;test please&quot; emails,&#160;</span><span style="line-height&#58;21px;background-color&#58;initial;">e</span><span style="line-height&#58;21px;background-color&#58;initial;">xpl</span><span style="line-height&#58;21px;background-color&#58;initial;">ain that they save time by getting early feedback, allowing bugs to be fixed whil</span><span style="line-height&#58;21px;background-color&#58;initial;">e it's still fresh in the developers'&#160;minds.
