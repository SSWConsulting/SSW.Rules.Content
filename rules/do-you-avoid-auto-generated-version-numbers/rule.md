<span class='intro'> <p>Every
release needs to have a version number. However, version numbers need to be
generated during the Build phase not the Release.</p> </span>

<p>​Imagine
the following scenario&#58; Your Build system generates a NuGet package with
version 1.0.4.5 that is pushed to Octopus Deploy NuGet feed. In Octopus Deploy
you create a release using the default configuration. When you create a new
release you will see 0.0.1 instead of 1.0.4.5. As you can imagine, it is
impossible to tell from the release what version number of the application was
really deployed. Hence you should change the versioning and use the package
version instead.</p><p><br></p><p>​<img src="2016-05-31_9-13-04.png" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;808px;" />​<br></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad">Bad
