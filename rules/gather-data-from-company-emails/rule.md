The emails exchanged within your company are more than just communication tools; they are a rich source of data. By analyzing this data, you can:

1. Gain insights into a company's operations
2. Detect bottlenecks
3. Better distribute workload
4. Make strategic decisions

**Microsoft Graph API** is a great tool to extract Outlook data. The extracted data is not just collected; it is transformed and displayed in Power BI reports by utilizing **Open AI** to analyze the emails. AI is able to analyze the data without having to worry about spelling, case sensitivity, nicknames or slang.

Emails should follow a set of [email rules](/rules-to-better-email) that make communication consistent and structured. When emails have standard format and content, data analysis is possible.
