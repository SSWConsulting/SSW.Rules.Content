When you set a break at a training course, you should make sure you first finish what you are doing. Don’t cut people off because of a clock.

<!--endintro-->
 Tell them 20 min break (or 1 hour for lunch) and:
* Let them break
* Write in a clear place the end time for the break and ask people to be back on time <dl class="image"> &lt;dt&gt; <img class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" alt="Break ends" src="break-ends.jpg"> &lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: Clearly show the end time for the break - you can print this <a href="/Documents/break-ends-sheet.pdf">PDF here</a><br></dd></dl>
* Set an alarm on your phone or PC
<dl class="image">&lt;dt&gt;<img class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" alt="iphone_timer.png" src="iphone_timer.png">&lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: iPhone alarm</dd></dl>
* If anyone comes back late,  **explain the value of integrity** . Honoring your word in small things makes it easier to honor it for larger things, such as doing your best in a sprint, and makes people believe in you more
