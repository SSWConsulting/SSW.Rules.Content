AI tooling has come a long way in the last few years. It's gone from being highly specialized and unreliable to generic and consistent. GPT-3 is an AI tool developed by [OpenAI](https://openai.com) with Microsoft investment and it is leading the pack in terms of AI capability.

<!--endintro-->

AI tooling has been developing at companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft for some time but until now it hasn't been accessible to the public. GPT-3 is the first large scale AI tool that is publicly available. It has been developed as a special model as a service that lets consumers and developers leverage it for their individual needs at a small cost.

Why is GPT-3 cool?

GPT-3 is cool because it is a powerful artificial intelligence language model that can generate human-like text. It can be used for a variety of tasks, such as natural language processing, text generation, and question answering. It has the potential to revolutionize the way people interact with computers and make AI more accessible to the general public.

### Technical Details
GPT-3 stands for Generative Pretrained Transformer 3. It has several advantages over the competition:

* It is trained on 175 billion parameters (compared with 1.5 billion for GPT-2)
* It generates output based on a prompt rather than searching a database
* It is pretrained on a data set as opposed to using several parameters to determine output (aka zero shot learning)
* The entire output is based on the entire input, rather than sequentially processing each word
* It follows the human model of creating a sentence all at once instead of not knowing the start and end of a sentence
