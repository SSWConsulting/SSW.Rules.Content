AI tooling has come a long way in the last few years. It's gone from being highly specialized and unreliable to generic and consistent. GPT-3 is the latest iteration of AI tools.
            
<!--endintro-->

AI tooling has been developing at companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft for some time but until now it hasn't been accessible to the public. GPT-3 is the first large scale AI tool that is publicly available. It has been developed as a special model as a service that lets consumers and developers leverage it for their individual needs at a small cost.

GPT-3 stands for Generative Pretrained Transformer 3. It has several advantages over the competition:

* It is trained on 175 billion parameters (compared with 1.5 billion for GPT-2)
* It generates output based on a prompt rather than searching a database
* It is pretrained on a data set as opposed to using several parameters to determine output (aka zero shot learning)
* The entire output is based on the entire input, rather than sequentially processing each word
* It follows the human model of creating a sentence all at once instead of not knowing the start and end of a sentence
