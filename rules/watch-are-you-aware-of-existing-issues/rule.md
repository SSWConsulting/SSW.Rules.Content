No doubt there will be a time when you get new developers to work on an existing application. Known issues with the existing application should be clearly delineated as much as possible. But new bugs will occur when changes have unforeseen effects on functionality down the line. This is to be expected.

<!--endintro-->

1st, make sure any known bugs are tracked in the backlog.

Then, generally you should prioritise any important bugs in your backlog to get rid of them asap. the longer a bug exists, often the more expensive it ends up being to fix.

Lastly, ask your developer to add a test case which will mean that in the future, important functionality will never "disappear" or break. The earlier you do this, the less pain you'll have down the track.
