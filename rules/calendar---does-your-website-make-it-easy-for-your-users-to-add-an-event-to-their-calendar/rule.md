<p>​
                    If you have a date for any event appearing on your website, you should make it as easy
                    as possible for the user to add it to their Outlook calendar. This is why we use
                    ICS links for all dates on our site.<br></p>

Both let you add appointments to your calendar. We use ICS because it allows 
   collaborating&#160;​<span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">information between personal information management programs like Microsoft O</span><span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">utlook, Mozilla Calendar, Mac </span> 
  OS<span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">&#160;etc. over the Internet, independently of differences between program vendors or operating systems, which is not allowed with VCS.</span></p><p> It is always preferred to use 
   <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterWebsitesNavigation.aspx#TheIcons"> standard icons</a> to give user a proper idea about the file. Users can quickly get the idea by just looking at the icon.​​<br></p>
