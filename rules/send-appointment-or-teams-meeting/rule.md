Microsoft Teams provides a very convenient Meeting app. To access it, simply navigate to &quot;Calendar&quot;&#160;and then either &quot;Meet Now&quot;&#160;or &quot;New Meeting&quot;<br>

<p></p><p><b>Important&#58;</b> Although the meeting app works great to organize Teamwork such as Scrum meetings or other client meetings, it is not very suitable for more global events such as a retreat or a conference. At SSW we use Microsoft Outlook appointments in those instances. </p><dl class="badImage"><dt>
