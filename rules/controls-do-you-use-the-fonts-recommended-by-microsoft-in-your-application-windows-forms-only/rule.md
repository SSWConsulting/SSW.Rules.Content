Some font are easier to read then others, at SSW we follow Microsoft's Visual Design Guidelines. This means we use Tahoma 8pt as our font of choice.

<!--endintro-->

Ensure all fonts on your forms are set to Tahoma but we allow controls to use a different font. This is because certain information is better displayed in a different font. For example a Textbox to show code should use Courier instead of Tahoma.
