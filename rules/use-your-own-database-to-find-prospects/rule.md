At SSW we don't believe in picking up the white pages and calling everyone in the book to make a sale. We believe in a more focused approach; we query our own SQL Servers for the prospects we're after. We also frown on buying lists because there's nothing worse than buying databases that have already been used and abused by the people before you. If you've got a business then you should always have a database to capture business and client information which can be queried against.
