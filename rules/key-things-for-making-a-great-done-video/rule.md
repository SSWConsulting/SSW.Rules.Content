For a great 'Done Video' here are the key things to remember:

<!--endintro-->

1. Generic - Keep your video generic enough for the world.
2. Prepare - Plan what you're going to say and open the browser tabs you'll show beforehand. This means you should practise what you're going to say, especially ending!
3. Framing - Have your webcam at eye-level or slightly higher.
4. Introduce - Start with "Hi everyone, today I would like to show you..." and summarize at the end.
5. Problem - Show the problem you're solving, not just the new feature.
6. One-Take - Record it in one take, but start again if it's super bad.
7. Quick - Keep it quick and easy, and quick and concise.
8. Directions - Give people an idea of where to look.
9. Clean - Use a clean browser and IDE, and zoom in to 125% in your browser.
10. Resolution - Set your screen resolution to 1080p (1920x1080).
11. Record - Record both your screen and webcam.
12. Audio - Check your audio devices for the best quality and make sure your audio is clear and not distracting.
13. Interact - Interact with your webcam like it's a person.
14. No Edit - Don't edit the video; use a picture-in-picture format and hotkeys to switch visuals. 

Remember to watch some "Done" videos to get an idea of what a good "Done Video" looks like!
