4. Invite the Staff members that will be part of the calendars, and choose their roles
5. Set up a service - this is a booking type that can be selected when visiting your booking page
6. Add any required custom questions or additional information
7. Choose who can book appointments - anyone with the link, people in your organization only, or no self service
