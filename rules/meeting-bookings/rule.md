3. Choose a name for your booking page (e.g., "Initial Recruitment Meetings") and customize it with your branding and settings
4. Invite the Staff members that will be part of the calendars, and choose their roles
5. Set up a service - this is a booking type that can be selected when visiting your booking page
6. Add any required custom questions or additional information
7. Choose who can book appointments - anyone with the link, people in your organization only, or no self service

### Create a Bookings with me page for individual bookings

1. Go to [Bookings with me](https://outlook.office.com/bookwithme/me) | This will trigger the creation of your individual calendar
2. Create a new meeting type | Set the availability and duration of the meetings
3. Add any specific questions or information you need from the external parties
4. Save your changes and share the booking page link with the people you want to meet individually
5. They can now easily schedule a meeting with you by selecting a suitable time slot from your availability üïí

### Adding your "Microsoft Bookings" link to your LinkedIn profile

Now that you created your booking calendar, one of the best places to use it is on Social Media, and below are instructions on how to use it on LinkedIn:

1. Turn on "Creator Mode" first - you can't have a link in your profile without it turned on

   ![Figure: Setup - Turn on Creator Mode in LinkedIn](creatormode.png)

4. Click on the Edit profile button

6. Add link and link text | Save

That's it! You're all set to let externals book meetings with you hassle-free using Microsoft Bookings! üéâ‚ú®

Remember, it's important to keep your booking pages up to date and regularly check for new bookings. Also, make sure to follow up with any additional instructions or confirmations after a booking is made.
