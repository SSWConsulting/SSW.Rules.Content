<span class='intro'> In Scrum, it's important to flesh out the details of a PBI when it makes sense to do so.<div><br></div><div>You should estimate your PBIs as soon as you can, but you&#160;don't need to break all of your PBIs down into fully-estimated tasks as soon as they're added to the backlog.</div><div><br></div><div>However,&#160;before starting work on a sprint you should always break the PBIs in that sprint into estimated tasks.</div><div>​<br></div> </span>

<p>Team Foundation Server uses the remaining hours assigned to Tasks to calculate the burndown. &#160;<span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">​By breaking the PBIs down into tasks with estimates, your burndown will start looking correct right from the first day of the sprint.</span></p><p><img src="burndown_bad_example.png" alt="burndown_bad_example.png" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;650px;" /><br></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad">Figure&#58; Bad Example - The tasks weren't estimated&#160;at the start of the sprint</dd><p><img src="burndown_good_example.png" alt="burndown_good_example.png" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;650px;" /><br></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Figure&#58; Good Example - The tasks were estimated&#160;from day one</dd><p>​<br></p>
