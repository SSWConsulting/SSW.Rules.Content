<span class='intro'> <p>​​Including images is a good idea, in addition when appropriate include code snippets, &#160;and ideally have the code that changed highlighted in ​<font style="background-color&#58;#ffff00;">yellow</font>.&#160;</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">An email with just the word &quot;done&quot;&#160;can often be enhanced with a screen capture or code snippet...<br>...it provides evidence<br>...it educates<br></p> </span>

<p>This has several benefits&#58;</p><ul><li>Improved visibility and transparency - The client can see the work actually being done</li><li>Reduced cost of fixing a bug - the cost of a bug goes up based&#160;of the length of time taken&#160;for the client to ask for a change. If you tell a developer&#160;to change&#160;something he did today, it is many times cheaper for him to fix, than if he got the same request 2 months later (when he has forgotten was it was about)&#160;</li><li>The client can raise questions based on what he sees in the code</li><li>Finally, in the very unlikely case that the code repository and backup goes corrupt, your emails are a backup!</li></ul><p>Let's look at some examples and tips&#58;</p><dl class="badImage"><dt> <img src="NotifyCodeChangesBad.gif" alt="" style="width&#58;620px;" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Bad example - the client cannot see any detail of what was done </dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt> <img src="NotifyCodeChanges.gif" border="0" alt="" style="width&#58;592px;" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good example - the client can see the image + the code changes highlighted in yellow </dd></dl><p> 
   <strong>Tip #1&#58; Include the URL<br></strong>If you are using TFS, you can also include a URL to the work item in TSWA<br><br><strong>Tip #2&#58; Include a .diff file<br></strong>You can include the code as an attached text file.&#160;&#160;<br></p><dl class="goodImage"><dt> <img src="NotePad2DiffFiles.gif" alt="" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good example - this is a Text file with a .diff extension that includes the code change from TFS. If opened using NotePad2, the client can view the code changes with green and red color (added and deleted code). </dd></dl><p>
   <strong>Tip 3#&#58; Do you have force a link between the code and the requirement?</strong></p><p>For those developers lucky enough to be using Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS 2005, 2008 or 2010) you can associate your code changes with a work item. This means that future developers can work out not just *what* changed, but *why*. <br>For those using TFS,&#160;enable the&#160;Checkin policy&#160;and force all developers to associate every check-in with a work item.</p><dl class="image"><dt> <img alt=" " src="SourceControl_AssociateWorkItems1.gif" /> <strong> </strong></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Make developers associate all check-ins to a work items </dd></dl> <dl class="image"> <dt> <img src="SourceControl_AssociateWorkItems2.gif" alt="" style="width&#58;563px;" /> <strong> </strong></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Enabling the Checkin Policy (via Project | Team Project Settings | Source Control | Add) </dd></dl> <br>
