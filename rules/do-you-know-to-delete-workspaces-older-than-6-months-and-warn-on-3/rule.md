The more workspaces you have the more load the TFS server is under when users check in and out. TFS has to check all of the workspaces for other checkouts of the same files which can be intensive if you have a lot of workspaces.

<!--endintro-->

If a developer had code checked out to a workspace that they have not even looked at in months, what is the likelihood that they even remember what changes they were making?

Why do workspaces build up?* Developers use multiple computers
* Developers use volatile virtual computers
* Developers reinstall their workstation
* Developers get new workstations
* Developers leave


Developer checklist:* Check workspaces often to see what you don't need
* Delete any workspaces you no longer need


TFS Master Checklist:* Delete all workspaces that have not been edited in 6 months
* Warn developers for workspaces that have not been accessed in 3 months
