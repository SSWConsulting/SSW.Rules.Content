Conducting a post-meeting evaluation (aka Retro) allows the board to reflect on the meeting's effectiveness, identify areas for improvement, and enhance future meetings.

### Benefits of Post-Meeting Evaluations

- **Continuous Improvement:** Identifies strengths and weaknesses in meeting structure and dynamics, enabling ongoing refinement.
- **Feedback Loop:** Provides a mechanism for members to express concerns or suggest improvements in a structured manner.
- **Enhance Meeting Quality:** Focuses on enhancing the quality and productivity of future meetings based on constructive feedback.

### How to Conduct Effective Evaluations

- **What went well?** Reflect on what worked well, or the main takeaways people got from the meeting. This reinforces good behavior.
- **What didn't go so well?** Identify where time was wasted, or if anyone has any gripes to share about how the meeting went.
- **What can we change for next time?** Implement changes for the next meeting, to double down on what went well, or fix what didn't.

Implementing a post-meeting evaluation process can significantly contribute to the continuous improvement of board meetings.
