<span class='intro'> <p>​Rebasing is great for ensuring a clean project history... but it can be dangerous in inexperienced hands.</p> </span>

<p> 
   <strong>The golden rule of&#160;git rebase&#160;is to never use it on&#160;public&#160;branches.&#160;</strong>(ie. never rebase&#160;master).</p><p>You should never rebase master onto a feature branch. This would&#160;move&#160;all of the commits in&#160;master&#160;onto the tip&#160;of&#160; the feature branch (not the other way around).&#160;</p><p>Since rebasing results in brand new commits, Git will think that your&#160;master&#160;branch’s history has diverged from everybody else’s.
