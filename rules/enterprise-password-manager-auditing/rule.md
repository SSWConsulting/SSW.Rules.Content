Auditing access data is crucial for any enterprise to ensure security and compliance. Having an audit trail provides visibility into who accessed what data, when, and from where. An effective enterprise password manager should be able to offer this feature.

6. **Export or Save**: If you wish to keep a record of the audit data outside of Keeper, you often have the option to export the data to various formats or save it for later review.

### **Why is Auditing Access Data Important?**

- **Security Oversight**: Monitoring who accesses data and when can identify potential security breaches or unauthorized access attempts.
   
- **Compliance**: Many industry regulations mandate businesses to maintain a detailed audit trail of data access, especially for sensitive or personal data.
   
- **Accountability**: An audit trail holds users accountable for their actions, discouraging misuse or unauthorized changes.

### **In Conclusion**

When selecting an enterprise password manager, auditing capabilities should be a priority. Keeper serves as a strong example of how detailed and user-friendly audit features can enhance security and transparency in data management.
