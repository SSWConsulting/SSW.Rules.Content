A client will often ask for a feature that will in most cases be unrealistic. Being able to reduce the scope and in greater narrow down the ideas of a Client will greatly improve the overall scope of the project.

<!--endintro-->

Most commonly on a project, you will be working with another developer. While taking notes and refining the product. As soon as possible, start estimating what you personally think a feature will take. 

Try estimate each feature of the product as you discuss it. At the end of the day go over with the other developers what you expect a feature to take and try narrow down the process. 

Often, a scope can expand and will expand when a feature isn’t as refined. If you are unsure about the specifics of a feature, enquire more, ask more questions!

Flag to the client, if a feature is going to take a significant amount of time and doesn’t add as much value. Try to have it moved outside of the MVP, and suggest for it to be completed further down the line.
