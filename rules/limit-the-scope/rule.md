<!--endintro-->

Most commonly on a project, you will be working with another developer. While taking notes and refining the product, start estimating what you personally think a feature will take. 


Try estimate each part of the product as you discuss it. At the end of the day go over with the other developers what you expect a part to take and try narrow down the process. 


Often, a scope can expand and will expand when a feature isn’t as refined. If you are unsure about the specifics of a feature, enquire more, ask more questions!


 Flag to the client, if a feature is going to take a significant amount of time and doesn’t add as much value. Add it out of MVP, and suggest for it to be completed further down the line.
