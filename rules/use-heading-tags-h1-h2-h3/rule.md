You should understand the hierarchy and try to use the heading tags (&lt;H1&gt;, &lt;H2&gt; or &lt;H3&gt;...) for titles and subtitles.

You should only use one H1 tag on a page. Search engines weight this heavily and can get confused by multiple main headings.

The following are benefits of using heading tags:

<!--endintro-->

* Improves the ranking with the search engines (extra weighting is given to text in H1 and H2)
* Makes cleaner and leaner HTML

Note: It's also important to customize these headings via CSS, making the font bigger, bold or in a different color. This way page looks nice and organized.


``` html
<p><span class="Heading">Introduction</span> 
      
Lets chatter about...</p>
