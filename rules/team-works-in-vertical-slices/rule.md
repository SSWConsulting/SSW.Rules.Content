As a Software Developer you often work with both the front and backend. Most people like to work with which ever is their strong suit. 

That doesn't help get your weaker skills stronger. Lets look at another way to increase your weaker skills.

<!--endintro-->

When working in teams it is often normal to split the work into what peoples strong suits are. This can be beneficial but it comes with a flaw of not helping developers strengthen their weaker skills. At SSW we prefer to do a whole slice of work each time (from the front end to the API, and any extras in between). 

Part of Scrum means all developers are responsible for the work that is conducted during a sprint. To push this point, as part of our definition of done; Adding 2 other developers to look over the code allows for,

1. The quality of code to remain high
2. Still allows for all developers to learn (Even those reviewing) 
3. Teaching the author of the PR 
4. Asking questions
