**Do you know it is better to send a v2 rather than recall the email, see SSW Rule [Do you know when and how to send a v2 of an email?](/email-send-a-v2)**
:::

Even though you may check your emails before sending, use SSW lookout to help you avoid mistakes, and even if you send/receive manually, there will still be times where you will send out an email with mistakes or incorrect content.

But all is not lost.

### With Outlook 2007

If you go into your sent items, open up the offending email, and go into Actions | Recall this Message, outlook will attempt to delete the message from the recipient's inbox before he has a chance to read it.
