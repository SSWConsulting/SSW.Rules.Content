Networking platforms like LinkedIn are essential for connecting with professionals in your industry. With numerous connections, remembering interaction specifics can be challenging. To foster meaningful relationships, personalize your connection requests using the following steps:

1. On the LinkedIn mobile app, avoid using the default "Connect" or "Message" buttons. Instead, use the "ellipsis | Personalize invite" button to craft a custom message. On the LinkedIn website, click "Connect | Add a note"

2. Begin your message with a friendly greeting, such as "Hey {{Name}}, it was great talking to you."
3. Provide context by mentioning where and how you met.
4. If applicable, mention shared interests or topics discussed to help both parties recall the conversation.
