<p>
                    When something happens in your company, always send around an email so that the
                    whole team is kept in the loop. </p>

<p>Examples of events that you should send an email
                    around for&#58;</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An update to a company standard or procedure (including a link to it)</li>
                    <li>Births and marriages</li>
                    <li>Employees who are starting or finishing</li>
                    <li>Anything significant that is happening in your life or the life of a loved one</li>

                    You should really feel free to share any good news you have with everyone. It will
                    make the office feel more like a family and not just a place to turn up to work.
                </p>
