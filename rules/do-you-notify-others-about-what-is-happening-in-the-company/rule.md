<p>
                    When something happens in your company, always send around an email so that the
                    whole team is kept in the loop. </p>

<p>Examples of events that you should send an email
                    around for&#58;</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An update to a company standard or procedure (including a link to it)</li>
                    <li>Births and marriages</li>
                    <li>Employees who are starting or finishing</li>
                    <li>Anything significant that is happening in your life or the life of a loved one</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    You should really feel free to share any good news you have with everyone. It will
                    make the office feel more like a family and not just a place to turn up to work.

                    Hi Guys, <br><br>
                    I'm heading to Sanya with my wife and kid this weekend, still remember the good time I had there last year at the MVP China Summit; also I think I do need to recharge myself for a little bit after long time working over 12 hours almost every day. <br><br>
                    Pretty excited right now as this will be the very 1st official trip that I take with my kid, hope he will likes the beach. <br><br>
                    Be prepared for more photos from my Nikon D80, I think it will be having a hard time during these 5 days.<br><br>
                    Will be back next Thursday, so if you need me for anything, call my mobile by skypein&#58; **** **** (if you are in Sydney), or 139 **** **** (if you are in Beijing) <br>
