The words we choose can significantly impact user experience. One such area of careful consideration is the language surrounding user authentication.

<!--endintro-->

## User authentication  

While "Log in" has been widely used in the past, modern applications tend to prefer **"Sign in"**. The term is widely recognized, intuitive, and aligns with current user expectations.  

::: info
**Note:** The term **"Login"** as a noun (no spaces) is still widely used in content, often interchangeably with the term **"Username"**.
:::

::: info
**Warning:** It's advised to steer clear of using "logon." This term, although it may have historical roots, has fallen out of favor and could potentially confuse users. Opting for more widely accepted alternatives ensures a smoother user experience.
:::

## User account creation  

When prompting users to create accounts, **"Sign up"** can sometimes be confused with **"Sign in"**. To avoid this, **"Register"** or **"Create account"** can offer clearer direction and convey a greater sense of formality and commitment.  

::: info
**Note:** **"Join"** is a versatile term that can be suitable, depending on the context. For instance, it works well when inviting users to become part of a group or community.

Always align terminology with the expectations and preferences of your target audience to create a more intuitive and consistent user experience.
