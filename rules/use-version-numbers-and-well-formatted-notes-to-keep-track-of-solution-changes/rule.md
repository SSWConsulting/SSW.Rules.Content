<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Dynamics uses a solution as a logical container to hold all customizations for a given function or sub-function. It is very important to have a versioning strategy around changes and when to increment versions.​<br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Increment the version *every time* a change is made and add a new line at the top&#160;of the description field containing&#58;​​<br></p><ol><li>New version number&#160;</li><li>Developer initials&#160;</li><li>​Change notes, can changes, removals, additions to the solution&#160;</li></ol><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">This gives you a quick and easy reference for the changes that have happened in the solution. Following this standard means comparing solutions across environments is a painless process.</p><p></p><dl class="badImage"><dt>​<img src="/PublishingImages/change-log-bad.png" alt="change-log-bad.png" style="width&#58;750px;" /></dt><dd>Bad Example&#58; Version 1.0.0.0, No change​log</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/change-log-good.png" alt="change-log-good.png" style="width&#58;750px;" /></dt><dd>Good Example&#58; Solution has up to date versioning with detailed changelog<br></dd></dl>
