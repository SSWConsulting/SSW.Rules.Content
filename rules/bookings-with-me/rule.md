**Video: Microsoft Bookings overview (1 min)**

You can create an individual booking page ("Bookings with me") or a shared booking page, for a team ("Microsoft Bookings").

1. Create a Microsoft Bookings page for a team:

   * Open [Microsoft Bookings](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-365/business/scheduling-and-booking-app)
   * Click on "Create" | Choose if you want to create from scratch or clone an existing one.
   * Choose a name for your booking page (e.g., "Initial Recruitment Meetings") and customize it with your branding and settings.
   * Invite the Staff members that will be part of the calendars, and choose their roles.
   * Set up a service - this is a booking type that can be selected when visiting your booking page.
   * Add any required custom questions or additional information.
   * Choose who can book appointments - anyone with the link, people in your organization only, or no self seervice.
   * Save your changes and share the booking page link with external parties.
   * Now, they can easily book a meeting with you by selecting a suitable time slot from the available options. 📅
2. Create a Bookings with me page for individual bookings:

   * Go to [Bookings with me](https://outlook.office.com/bookwithme/me) | This will trigger the creation of your individual calendar.
   * Create a new meeting type | Set the availability and duration of the meetings.
   * Add any specific questions or information you need from the external parties.
   * Save your changes and share the booking page link with the people you want to meet individually.
   * They can now easily schedule a meeting with you by selecting a suitable time slot from your availability. 🕒

That's it! You're all set to let externals book meetings with you hassle-free using Microsoft Bookings! 🎉✨

Remember, it's important to keep your booking pages up to date and regularly check for new bookings. Also, make sure to follow up with any additional instructions or confirmations after a booking is made. Good luck! 🤞
