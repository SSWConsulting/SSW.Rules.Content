Sites can grow to get a lot of traffic from across the globe, it's important that your site complies with any local regulations. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for Europe, has been [tightening cookie usage laws since 2018](https://gdpr.eu/cookies/). The GDPR mandates that websites obtain explicit consent from users before storing or retrieving any non-essential information on their devices, such as cookies used for tracking and personalization. This regulation aims to protect users' privacy and give them greater control over their personal data.

By implementing a cookie consent banner, we ensure transparency and adhere to legal requirements, thereby fostering trust and safeguarding our users' rights.

Creating a cookie consent banner doesn't have to be tricky, it can be done in 3 steps:

1. Cookie banner UI
2. Creating and sending cookies
3. Setting up GTM consent mode as per user preferences

## Cookie Banner UI

This section is very much customizable and will be different from site to site. Essentially you should create a pop-up, banner, or modal that will be prompted to users when visiting your site. [Tina.io](https://tina.io) uses a banner along the bottom of the page.

The 3 button options should be:

* "Accept All" ‚Äì Users accepts all types of cookies
* "Reject All" ‚Äì Users reject all cookies
* "Customize" ‚Äì According to GDRP we must allow users to manage their cookie preferences at any time. When users go to customize, all options must **not** be ticked

The Tina.io website let users customize their preferences with a modal.

## Creating and Sending Cookies

This section will actually send your cookie based on how users have interacted with your UI. You can use a nifty library called ‚Äòjs-cookie‚Äô which provides a super easy way to transmit a cookie.

1. Install package and use on your component

  ```bash
  npm install js-cookie
  ```
  
  ```js
  import Cookies from 'js-cookie';
  ```

2. Create Cookie Variable and Set
   Example with a cookie that has all fields accepted, named 'consentGiven'

  ```js
      const acceptedConsent = {
        ad_storage: true,
        ad_personalization: true,
        analytics_storage: true,
        ad_user_data: true,
      };
  
      Cookies.set('consentGiven', JSON.stringify(acceptedConsent), {
        expires: 365,
      });
  ```

3. Confirm your cookie is being sent correctly

After interacting with the cookie banner, head to **Developer Tools (F12) | Application | Cookies | {{ YOUR SITE }}**

For example, the Tina.io cookie:
