SQL Server includes Database Mail (it was a new feature released back in 2005 as a replacement for SQL Mail). Database Mail is a great feature as it allows:

- HTML messages natively supported - so there's no need to use 3rd party dlls anymore
- Communication direct with SMTP server - There's no need for outlook or MAPI profiles on server
- Multiple profiles and accounts supported to specify multiple SMTP servers or different email infrastructure situations
- SQL Server queues messages even when the external mailing process fails
- High security - users and roles have to be granted permission to send mail
- Logging and auditing
- Attachment size regulations and file extension requirements
