<p>Some people communicate with a&#160;'Wall of Text'. Communicate better by using screenshots and reduce your amount of words. <br><br>You can take screen captures to the next level by adding balloons that have the appropriate text (aka speech bubbles).&#160;Sometimes you need only the text in the balloon and no text in the email.</p>
<p>The balloon is great because you can point to a specific part of the image. It is much easier than reading the old ‘Wall of Text’.<br><br>Let's look at a bad and good example.- </p>

<img src="/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/PublishingImages/BalloonBadExample.jpg" alt="Baloon Bad Example" class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" /> <span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureBad">Figure&#58; Bad example – The email is using a screenshot so that is good, but you need to read the text and relate it to the image</span><br>
<img src="/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/PublishingImages/BalloonGoodExample.jpg" alt="Check the shadow properties" class="ms-rteCustom-ImageArea" />
<span class="ms-rteCustom-FigureGood">Figure&#58; Good example – The balloon with text on the screenshot, makes it quicker to understand</span>
