When redirecting users to another page make sure that the       text is consistent between the two pages.

:::

As an example, the SSW website follows a consistent order: a summary of the product/service and its benefit followed by a longer paragraph with more information. When we want to redirect users to a page we simply use the summary part of that page as narrative on the other page (e.g. events list). As a result, user will have a nice flow between pages when navigating around the site.     [See a live example](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Events/).

Please Note: the figure here is intended to show the consistency in the text, the use of a link called More is not desirable as per our Google Rule     [Do your links have relevancy to the page you're linking to?](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterGoogleRankings.aspx#Relevancy)

Please Note #2: This is about the text being consistent. However you should also keep your links consistent.
