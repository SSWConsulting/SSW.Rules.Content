When redirecting users to another page make sure that the text is consistent between the two pages.

![Figure: Good Example - This text is taken from where the "More on SSW Chinafy" link goes](homepage-with-link-to-chinafy.png)

![Figure: Good Example - You can see the text again here, at the link's destination](chinafy-page.png)

As an example, the [SSW website](https://ssw.com.au/) follows a consistent order: a summary of the product/service and its benefit, followed by more information o that topic. 

When we want to redirect users to a page, we simply use the summary part of that page as narrative on the other page. As a result, the user will have a nice flow between pages when navigating around the site.
