When redirecting users to another page, make sure that the text is consistent between the two pages.

![Figure: Good Example - You can see the text again here, at the link's destination](chinafy-page.png)
:::

As an example, the [SSW website](https://ssw.com.au/) follows a consistent order: a summary of the product/service and its benefit, followed by more information on that topic. 

When we want to redirect users to a page, we simply use the summary part of that page as narrative on the other page. As a result, the user will have a nice flow between pages when navigating around the site.

Tip: In this scenario where the summary serves as a teaser for more detailed content, have the link at the end of the section, so it's the natural next step for someone who has read it and wants to know more.
