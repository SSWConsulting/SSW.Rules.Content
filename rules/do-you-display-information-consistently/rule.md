<span class='intro'> <p>When redirecting users to another page make sure that the 
     text is consistent between the two pages.
                </p> </span>

   </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good example - Click &quot;More&quot; and the next page begins with the same information</dd></dl><p> As an example, the SSW website follows a consistent order&#58; a summary of the product/service and its benefit followed by a longer paragraph with more information. When we want to redirect users to a page we simply use the summary part of that page as narrative on the other page (e.g. events list). As a result, user will have a nice flow between pages when navigating around the site. 
   <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Events/">See a live example</a>. </p><p> Please Note&#58; the figure here is intended to show the consistency in the text, the use of a link called More is not desirable as per our Google Rule 
   <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterGoogleRankings.aspx#Relevancy">Do your links have relevancy to the page you're linking to?</a> </p><p> Please Note #2&#58; This is about the text being consistent. However you should also keep your links consistent. </p>
