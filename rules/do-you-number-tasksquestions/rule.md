<p>It is good practice to be clear on what you want. One way you can make things clearer is to number tasks or questions. <br></p><p><b>Note&#58;</b> Receiving an email with just numbered items is cold -&#160;An email with a paragraph of context, then numbers is much nicer<br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<div class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox"><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox"><b>Hi Bob,</b><br>Make sure to use Linq to SQL for the bit where you execute Stored Procs. First, double check that executing Stored Procs is still an outstanding issue with EDMX. <br>Don't forget to create a .txt file of the same name to the rule, so other developers know why you did this.<br></p></div><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad"> Bad example - the different tasks may be skipped if the reader does not read carefully<br></dd><div class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox"><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox"><b>Hi Bob,</b><br><span style="color&#58;#333333;">We need to confirm the store procedures on Mr. Northwind project and also make sure we have documenation on it.<br><br>1.
