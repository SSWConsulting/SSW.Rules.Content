Should you declare variables at the top of the function, or declare them when you need to use them? If you come back to your code after a few weeks and you no longer need a variable, you are quite likely to forget to delete the declaration at the top, leaving orphaned variables. Here at SSW, we believe that variables should be declared as they are needed.

....many lines of code...

intRoutesPerDay = 2
