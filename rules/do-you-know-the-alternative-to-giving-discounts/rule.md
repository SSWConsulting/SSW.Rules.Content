Some clients really want a discount. Most will be happy with a discount for pre-paying. Others won't go ahead until they feel they have got something more.

If a client asks for a further discount, try to add value by offering something else.

e.g.

<!--endintro-->

* Some of your products at no charge
* 
* 
* A Senior Consultant for 2 hours a month to complete the following tasks:
    * Code Review
    * UI Review


Also bear in mind that offers like 2 for 1 are better than 50% discount because:

* You sell for the price you wanted instead of losing money - adding an extra person or a licence is inexpensive
* You are adding value to what you are selling e.g. more people will turn up to the event
