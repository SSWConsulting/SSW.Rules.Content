We all know how email groups work - you send an email to the group address, and all members of the group get the email.

Microsoft 365 groups add a lot of extra functionality to groups. The main things are a calendar, and a Team for conversations and file storage (optional) - but they also have additional settings. One big one is that you can choose to receive the group emails in your inbox or not, by following/unfollowing the group.

Email can be noisy - we all want to reduce the number of emails we receive. This option to unfollow groups is really useful - here are some use cases:

1. You have a group that receives a lot of email that does not need to be actioned, but may need to be found at a later date. You can happily unfollow this group, remove the noise from your inbox, and check the group folder later if needed.
2. You have a team where one person is the main point of contact - but others need to help out occasionally. For example, if you own a lot of domains, you will receive many emails about their renewals. It is good practice to have one person managing this - but it is also good practice to have the emails going to a group (not just an individual). Other members of the team can unfollow the group, and only check the folder if the resposible person is unavailable.

## Following/unfollowing as a user

To follow or unfollow a group in Outlook:

1. Go to the group in the navigation pane
2. Go to Group Settings in the ribbon
3. Choose which items you would like to receive in your inbox
