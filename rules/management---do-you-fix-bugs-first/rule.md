<span class='intro'> 
  <p>This rule has been important for a long time&#58; Fix bugs before adding functionality.​<br></p>
<ul>
    <li>Bugs get more expensive as they get older<br></li>
    <li>Bugs become more complex the longer you wait to fix them</li>
    <li>You have better access to the developer&#160;who created it who will be able to fix it&#160;faster<br></li>
</ul>
 </span>

<p>Failing to follow this rule encourages developers and creators to focus on new 'interesting' functionality&#160;which is exactly what you don't want...<br>You must be strong in the face of pressures from project plan scheduling!<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox"><b>Note&#58;</b> The principle of this bug rule can apply to more than just developers.<br>​<br>Let's suppose&#160;you work in Marketing and have a problem with a hypothetical&#160;report. You should fix that issue first, before adding new information&#160;to the report.<br></p>
