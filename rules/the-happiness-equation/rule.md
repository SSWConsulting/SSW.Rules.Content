Bosses want a place where people help each other.

Scenarios:

* New great project – someone is assigned to it... someone is unhappy
* New promotion – someone else is unhappy

These might seem like unfair situations. People don’t want to be unfair... friends don't... bosses don't.

<!--endintro-->

The best way to deal with situations like this is by knowing:

1. **Gotta speak up** - See [Do you know to speak up?](/speak-up)
2. **Happiness is relative** - Unhappiness comes from comparisons with others
3. **Get one thing in life, lose another** - Can't have everything
4. **The 'Happiness Equation'** - Happiness = Expectations - Reality   
   - Reduce your expectations
   - Increase your reality
5. **Consider luck** - Everyone wants to succeed in life. But what causes some of us to be more successful than others? Is it really down to skill and strategy - or something altogether more unpredictable? Read [the book "Fooled by Randomness"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fooled_by_Randomness)
6. **Compete with yourself by embracing Scrum** – Competing with yourself is the best approach.  
   In software, Scrum is the best as you are only compare yourself... or you team with what you did before. You only use empirical data.
7. **Understand intentions** - Try to see yourself in others shoes.  
   Understand that people don't want to be unfair. It is common to assume the wrong stuff.
8. **Be the 'squeaky wheel'**
   > "A squeaky wheel gets the most oil."

   Ask questions... you will understand even better friends or bosses know this is a topic you have interest... so they'll give you extra information. 
9. **Have attainable ambition** - Expectations to be realistic enough to push you, not so much that it makes you unhappy.  
   Overly ambitious people are often unhappy... they never get there... never rich or successful enough... 
10. **Celebrate other people's wins** - Be at a place where you are pushing each other up rather than climbing over each other. Everybody gets their days of sunshine. When others achieve a goal, be happy for them, send a nice message, 'like' their posts, etc.  
   > "Always clap for your friends, even if their dreams come true before yours."

Do the above and you can have a culture of helping yourself and helping others.
