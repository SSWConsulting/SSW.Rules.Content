Bosses want a place where people want to help each other

New great projects – someone is assigned to it… someone unhappy

New promotion – someone is unhappy

These seems unfair situations
-	People don’t want to be unfair… friends don’t…. bosses don’t

            
<!--endintro-->

The solution are:

1. Gotta Speak Up

[see the other rule]

2. Happiness is relative - unhappiness comes from comparisons with others

3. Get one thing in life - Lose another.
Cant have everything

4. The Happiness Equation
Happiness = Expectations - Reality. 
Reduce your expectations
Increase your reality

Ask lots of questions…

5. Luck. 
Book: Fooled by Randomness
6. Embrace Scrum – Competing with yourself is the best approach
In software, scrum is the best as you are only compare yourself… or you team with what you did before.
You only use empirical data.

7. Understand intention
Try to see yourself in others shoes
Understand that people don't want to be unfair. 
It is common to assume the wrong stuff

8. Be the Squeaky Wheel
Quote: A squeaky wheel gets the most oil
Ask questions… you will understand
Even better friends or bosses know this is a topic you have interest… so guess what they give you updates when stuff changes 
9. Make expectations attainable.
or Have attainable ambition
ambition to be realistic enough to push you
Not so much that it makes you unhappy
xxx Overly ambitious people are unhappy… they never get there… never rich enough…. 

10. Celebrate other peoples wins
Do the above and you can have a culture of helping yourself and helping others
… want to be at a place when you are pushing each other up
Rather than climbing over each other
Everybody gets their days of sunshine
- so be happy for them… send a nice message… like their post etc.
