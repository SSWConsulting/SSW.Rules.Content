Explaining problems can be really hard. Often, when you are trying to talk with someone about it, they get lost and frustrated because they don't fully understand the context.

That's why it is crucial to start at a fully zoomed out level and slowly zoom in with your audience.

<!--endintro-->

When trying to explain something think about it in the context of 3 levels of zoom:

* Level 1 - Concept
* Level 2 - Challenge
* Level 3 - Core

Each level provides a little bit more context so that the listener can understand the next level down and eventually reach the core question.

### Scenario
Let's take a look at an example of how these levels are applied practically.

A developer has recently been asked to build a new table view that shows information about the work consultants have done on client projects.

They have run into a roadblock because they aren't really sure how best to get the data from the database.

In particular, they aren't sure exactly what query to run or how to structure the classes in the code.

What they shouldn't do is jump straight into the meat of the problem by saying something like:

::: greybox
I’m not sure how best to query the database efficiently, or how I should be structuring the DTO in a way that doesn’t duplicate information unnecessarily
:::
::: bad 
Figure: Bad example - The listener has no idea what screen or problem is being talked about
:::

### Level 1 - Concept

Explain the concept first to give a big picture view of what’s being discussed. 

::: greybox
I am working on a table view in TimePro, which needs to display information about how many hours our consultants worked on each client project.
:::
::: good
Figure: Good example - Now a baseline for what we are talking about has been established
:::

### Level 2 - Challenge

Next, zoom in a little to talk about your challenge with this task (as in why you’re having this conversation in the first place).

::: greybox
The challenge I’m facing is finding a suitable way of getting the relevant data, because of the flexibility between which clients are selected, and which consultants may be present.
:::
::: good
Figure: Good example - This sentence helps the listener understand the specific difficulties being faced
:::

### Level 3 - Core
Now that the audience knows what you’re trying to achieve and the challenges, you can delve deep into the core question itself. 

::: greybox
I’m not sure how best to query the database efficiently, or how I should be structuring the DTO in a way that doesn’t duplicate information unnecessarily
:::
::: good
Figure: Good example - A baseline context for the concept and challenge have been established, so the listener can understand the original question
:::

### Who can do it?
You might be thinking these examples are very specific to developers...but you can really do it in any kind of role.

Let's look at an example for an admin.

An admin has been asked to procure a pinball machine for the office.

They've run into a roadblock because the one that they were asked to get is out of stock everywhere.

Now, they want to find out if they should wait 2 months for stock to come back or order another one they found online.

So, they should make sure they don't jump in with the first question about waiting 2 months.

::: greybox
Should I wait 2 months for the pinball machine we wanted to restock, or should I order this other one?
:::
::: bad
Figure: Bad example - The concept and challenge haven't been explained yet, making it confusing
:::

::: greybox 
I'm ordering that pinball machine we talked about.

Unfortunately, it's out of stock everywhere and won't be back in stock for 2 months.

Should I wait 2 months for the pinball machine we wanted to restock, or should I order this other one?

::: good
Figure: Good example - The concept was explained, then the challenge, then the core
