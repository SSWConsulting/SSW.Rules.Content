Explaining problems can be really hard. Often, when you are trying to talk with someone about it, they get lost and frustrated because they don't fully understand the context.

That's why it is crucial to start at a fully zoomed out level and slowly zoom in with your audience.

<!--endintro-->

When trying to explain something think about it in the context of 3 levels of zoom.

### Level 1 - Concept

Explain the concept first to give a big picture view of what’s being discussed. 

E.g. – “I am working on a table view in TimePro, which needs to display a bunch of information about how many hours our consultants worked  given client projects, like this: <show/explain the concept>”.

### Level 2 - Challenge

Zoom in a little to talk about your challenge with this task (why you’re having this conversation in the first place). 

E.g. – “The challenge I’m facing is finding a suitable way of getting the relevant data, because of the flexibility between which clients are selected, and which consultants may be present”.

### Level 3 - Core
Now that the audience knows what you’re trying to achieve and the challenges, you can delve deep into the core question itself. 

E.g. – “Given the dynamics possible, I’m not really sure on how best to query the database efficiently, or how I should be structuring the DTO/View Model in a way that doesn’t duplicate information unnecessarily”.

\#﻿## Who can do it?
You might be thinking these examples are very specific to developers...but you can really do it in any kind of role.
