​​​​​​​​​With a mountain of emails, it is difficult to make sure the most important tasks get done first. You want to keep your clients happy while still removing roadblocks for others. <br>

      <strong>Urgent emails</strong> - emails with "URGENT" in the subject e.g. URGENT - the website is down</li><li>Emails about <strong></strong> <a href=/do-you-know-how-important-timesheets-are>Timesheets </a>or invoicing issues<br></li><li>Your calendar - <a href=/calendar-does-your-calendar-always-accurately-show-where-you-are>keep your calendar up-to-date,​ ​​</a>so people know where you are <br></li><li> 
      <strong>Your existing clients</strong> - e.g. Normal planned client work and client administration (preferably working on a sprint <a href=/do-you-know-how-to-manage-the-product-backlog>backlog</a> and Daily Scrums)<br></li><li>
