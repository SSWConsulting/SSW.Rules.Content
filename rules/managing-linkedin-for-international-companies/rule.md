✅ Growth – You can grow your audience in a single LinkedIn Page as opposed to starting from zero every time you add a new office location! <br>
✅ Reach – As your audience grows and so does your engagement, you will be able to reach more people and businesses <br>
✅ Employment – You will be able to advertise all the roles you are hiring for, locally and internationally, if this is your case <br>
✅ Scaling up – If your business is growing, you will be able to manage your LinkedIn presence under a single page and your business will look bigger as it grows! <br>

## Why create targeted posts in different languages?

LinkedIn is extremely popular in North America, Europe, and Asia. Having a multilingual profile can increase your online visibility and help reach existing and new clients and partners in these locations, which are also the largest and fastest-growing economies.  

### Considerations to keep in mind

When creating a multilingual LinkedIn Company page, some key elements to keep in mind are: 

* Make sure your services/products are suitable for the new audience you are targeting your content to as all market will have their own individualities;
* Ensure you are communicating the same message in all languages, and nothing is getting lost in translation;
* You will need to invest in research to find out how your new audience is consuming content so you can adapt to that.
