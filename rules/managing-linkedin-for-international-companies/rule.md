## Why create targeted posts in different languages?

LinkedIn is extremely popular in North America, Europe, and Asia. Having a multilingual profile can increase your online visibility and help reach existing and new clients and partners in these locations, which are also the largest and fastest-growing economies.  

### Considerations to keep in mind

When creating a multilingual LinkedIn Company page, some key elements to keep in mind are: 

* Make sure your services/products are suitable for the new audience you are targeting your content to as all market will have their own individualities;
* Ensure you are communicating the same message in all languages, and nothing is getting lost in translation;
* You will need to invest in research to find out how your new audience is consuming content so you can adapt to that.
