Having a minimum number for live events is important so everyone is on the same page. We find that a good minimum for live events is 6 people. 

<!--endintro-->

It is important not to cancel live events because people who have already registered become disappointed in the business and the business loses credibility. At times people who have already booked tickets, have also booked accommodation and air fares which causes additional pain to everyone. Having a reasonable number of attendees to attend each event will reduce these issues.

If you are running these events for lead generation purposes then not covering event costs with ticket sales isn't a problem. Additionally if you don't run a lead generation event you potentially lose the leads you have.
