<span class='intro'> Some managers or approvers can get very busy, and if you don't manage them closely, can cause deadlines to be missed, opportunities to pass by, and work to be wasted. Remember, they're usually doing a lot of other important work, and although approving your piece of work is important to your workflow, it may be less important in the big picture than what is taking up their attention​.&#160;<br><br> </span>

<p>​The best way to ensure your work is approved and goes live is to physically sit down with the approver and get it approved on the spot. However, if this is not possible due to unavailability, you need to have a back up plan to make sure your work is not wasted.<br></p><p>The best solution in this case is to set an agreed timeframe for any approval, after which time, you will assume a &quot;test passed&quot;.&#160;</p><p>To avoid the approver feeling hard done by, make sure you do the following&#58;<br></p><ol><li>The&#160;time frame needs to be more than reasonable, to allow the approver time to get to it if it is actually important for them to see.<br></li><li>The approver need to be reminded when half of time timebox​ has expired, and again on the last day,&#160;to ensure that they are aware that their approval is about to be bypassed, and can request an extension if necessary.<br></li></ol>
