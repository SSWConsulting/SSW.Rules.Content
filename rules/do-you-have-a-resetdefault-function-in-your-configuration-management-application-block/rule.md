In almost every application we have a user settings file to store the state of the application. We want to be able to reset the settings if anything goes wrong.

See how we configured this reset default settings functionality with the Configuration Block in the [.NET Toolkit](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/NetToolKit/06ConfigurationBlock.aspx)
