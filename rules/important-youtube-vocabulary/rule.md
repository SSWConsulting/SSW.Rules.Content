They are a few important terms you need to know and remember when using YouTube to make sure your content will "fit" the site better.

<!--endintro-->

Always consider the below notions. They are important for YouTube and therefore for your content. If your content helps YouTube, YouTube will help you. So always pay attention to:

* **Session time** : the amount of time spent by a person on YouTube after watching your video. The higher the better.
* **Watch time** : total time spent watching a YouTube video since it went live. The higher the better.
* **Pattern interrupts** : elements in a video that are different from the rest of the video (they literally “interrupt” the “content”). These can be graphics, other video extracts, camera angle changes etc.
* **CTR** : Clickthrough rate (CTR) can be used to gauge how well your keywords and ads are performing. CTR is the number of clicks that your ad receives divided by the number of times your ad is shown: clicks ÷ impressions = CTR. For example, if you had 5 clicks and 100 impressions, then your CTR would be 5%. On average, in Google Ads, technology related content gets a CTR of 2.38% for search and 0.84% for display (average CTR in Google Ads for all industries is 1.91% for search and 0.35% for display). A good Google Ads click-through rate is 4-5%+ on the search network or 0.5-1%+ on the display network.
* **Audience retention** : percentage length of your video that viewers watched. If a video lasts 2 minutes and someone watches for 30 seconds, audience retention is 25%. The higher the better and ideally, this value would be 25% at least.
