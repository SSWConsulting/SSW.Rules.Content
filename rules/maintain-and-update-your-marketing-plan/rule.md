<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​We suggest you follow up and update your metrics and results on a monthly basis to&#160;help you understand if your strategy and your marketing efforts are working.<br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Every&#160;4&#160;months you should meet with your team to present results and brainstorm on activities than can be done or you might need help with. After 6 months, we recommend reviewing your strategy to make sure&#160;that&#160;it is still aligned to the company’s core goals, and if no changes are required, just keep tweaking your campaigns and you can review it after a year to measure your efforts and analyze if need budget adjustments are needed for the next year.​<br></p>
