The aim of most meetings should be to come up with next steps. These should be shared with the intended recipient, as well as CCing all other attendees.

<!--endintro-->

Common action items include:
*	The outcomes from agenda points marked as “for decision”
*	Parking lot topics that require more discussion by subsets of the meeting’s attendees
*	Ad hoc tasks that come up from brainstorming
