Public Websites done completely with Flash or Silverlight can be very eye-catching                     and used in the right spots can achieve way more than you can ever achieve with                     HTML. But beware because:

<!--endintro-->

* It does not work on an iPhone or iPad
* Flash/Silverlight can be slow loading, especially if the visitor is not using a
                        fast Internet connection. If your website doesn't load within 5 seconds, they're
                        gone. (There are techniques to overcome this)
* It is bad for search engine rankings as there is no content for search engine spiders
                        to crawl through. (There are techniques to overcome this)
* Navigation via the back button (and Browser History). (There are techniques to overcome
                        this)
* Accessibility
* Often seen with busy designs that turn off or distract visitors. Look at the biggest
                        ecommerce sites and you notice that none of them are Flash websites
* In many cases it unnecessarily creates page bloat
* You can \*almost\* get the same effects and functionality using jQuery, but faster
                        and lighter
* You get an inconsistent UI if you use it for controls such as text boxes
* Flash and Silverlight do not support CSS, so you need to follow unfamilar concepts
                        for re-skinning


Finally, and saddest of all, when Flash/Silverlight is used, it is normally over used.

**Footnote #1:** It is clear that Flash has been quite successful in the past - the penetration                         of its run time is 99% on PCs, however because of the fact iPhone and iPad don’t run it and the growth of HTML 5, Flash is now considered an old technology.

**Footnote #2: ** The development of Silverlight has been discontinued as of 2012 due to the poor acceptance of Silverlight and restrictions Microsoft imposed on its utility.
