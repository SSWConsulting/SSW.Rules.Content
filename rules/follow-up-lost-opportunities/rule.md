Losing a sales opportunity doesn't mean losing a connection. Maintaining relationships is key as it can lead to future work. A great, low-pressure way to stay in touch is via LinkedIn.

If you lost a sales opportunity, add them to LinkedIn and send a message (if you have already added them a while ago, ask someone else to).

For example:

::: greybox
Hey Bob - As per my email I'd love to do your xxx project when you are ready.

We are doing some really cool AI projects these days.
