<p>People don't go to your Twitter profile as often as they visit your website. It's a good idea to have your Twitter timeline on your website. The Embeddable timelines are interactive and also enable your visitors to reply, Retweet, and favorite Tweets directly from your website&#160;pages.​​ The best place to put it is on the sidebar.<br></p>
