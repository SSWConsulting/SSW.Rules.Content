Sometimes a senior leader intervenes in an issue that could be handled by someone else who is well-informed and close to the problem. This intervention is not a good idea because it diverts focus from high importance strategic priorities that senior leaders should be involved in. Instead it is better for the senior leader to ask the person closest to the issue to fix the problem, that way they feel empowered and the senior leader can focus on strategy.

<!--endintro-->

## The problems
When senior leaders are involved in every level of decisions, it causes several problems including:
- Setting the wrong tone for how senior leadership is spending their time.
- Conveying a "command and control" model of management, disempowering others.
- Inefficient use of company resources.

## The solution
Resolving this problem is easy, when a senior leaders notices an issue they should ask someone closer to the issue to resolve it instead. This delegation leads to benefits such as:
- Employee empowerment because all employees have important decision making capability
- Increased efficiency because senior leaders are focused on issues which need their attention more
- Reduced bottlenecks because senior leaders are not the only ones making decisions

[Cross approvals](/cross-approvals) is a great system which helps enact this solution because it makes it clear who is responsible for addressing a specific issue

## Scenario - Malfunctioning office printer
Imagine that the office printer is malfunctioning and the CEO notices it's not working

### ❌ Bad Example - The CEO sends a company wide email
It's not a good idea for the CEO to send an email to everyone about this issue. It distracts everyone, including the CEO themselves.

The outcome of this approach is that:
- Everyone is distracted, including the CEO
- A poor impression is given for how the CEO spends their time
- The people who are good at printer troubleshooting feel disempowered

### ✅ Good Example - The CEO notifies someone who is well-versed in printer troubleshooting
A better scenario is for the CEO to call someone well-versed in printer troubleshooting and allocate the task to them instead. The CEO should also communicate that they want that employee to handle this task in the future.

The outcome of this approach is that:
- The printer is fixed efficiently with minimal distractions
- The CEO can focus on strategic priorities
- The employee fixing the printer feels empowered.


## Conclusion
Empowering those closest to an issue to make decisions fosters efficiency, collaboration, and strategic focus within the business. By delegating tasks to those best suited to handle them, senior leaders can concentrate on high-priority matters, enhancing overall productivity and employee satisfaction.
