Whenever a long process is churning away (e.g. about 10 seconds) users will usually do something else, either make a coffee or switch to another window.

<!--endintro-->

Your application should remind the user to go back and check on it by:

* Playing a sound
* Hiding the progress bar
* Showing a message box at the end of the long process


See rule on [Do you know how to make long-running processes user-friendly?](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulestoBetterInterfaces-Windows-Applications.aspx#LongProcessFriendly)

When using Message Box to indicate user a process is done, always includes detailed summary of the process. Don't just say "Process completed."

Process completed.

This is just like standing at a set of traffic lights listening for the beep to know when to walk, rather than constantly looking at the red and green lights.
