Every rule must have a person responsible for its content - The rule owner. The way readers see this person is on the &quot;Acknowledgement&quot; section.

<p>​When editing a rule, choose who is the rule owner on the &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; field. It is OK to have more than one person there.</p><dl class="image"><dt><img src="/Communication/Rules-to-Better-Adding-Rules/PublishingImages/Pages/add-acknowledgements-to-rules/acknowledgements.jpg" alt="acknowledgements.jpg" />​</dt><dd>Figure&#58; This is where you add or remove &quot;Ackowledgements&quot;. Click on &quot;Go to lookup list to add new value​&quot; if the person is not on the list yet</dd></dl>
