Control4 is a home automation system that allows you to control devices in your home from a single platform. The Control4 Project Creation process involves several stages, including connecting the Controller, adding devices, creating rooms and scenes, programming the system, and testing and troubleshooting. Each stage includes several steps necessary to create a customized Control4 system.

You'll do most of the steps below in Composer Pro, the Control4 Director.
