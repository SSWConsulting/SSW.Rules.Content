<span class='intro'> <p>You should not provide a database schema via several screen captures - it has little information of the details. A well formatted Word document may be providing more details information, but it is not easy to maintain the document to keep it up-to-date. The best way is to automatically generate your document with a tool.<br></p> </span>

<p>We recommend and use&#160;<a href="https&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/DeveloperGeneral/SQLservertools.aspx#SqlDoc">Red-Gate SQL Doc</a>&#160;to produce chm help files or html pages of the database schema. SQL Doc also allows you to run via the command line so you can include the generation in your build process to be automatically created.</p><p>We have also have used these other available tools in the past&#58;&#160;<a href="https&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/DeveloperGeneral/SQLservertools.aspx#SqlScribe">SQL Scribe</a>&#160;and&#160;<a href="https&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/DeveloperGeneral/SQLservertools.aspx#ApexSqlDoc">Apex SQL Doc</a>.​<br></p>
