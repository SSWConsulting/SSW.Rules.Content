To make office documents with content preview available in search result, you need to setup an Office App server and link it to SharePoint: 
<!--endintro-->
<dl class="image">&lt;dt&gt;<img src="preview-sharepoint.png" alt="preview-sharepoint.png"><span style="color:#555555;font-size:0.9rem;font-weight:bold;line-height:16px;">Figure: Preview Office documents on SharePoint</span>&lt;/dt&gt;</dl>
