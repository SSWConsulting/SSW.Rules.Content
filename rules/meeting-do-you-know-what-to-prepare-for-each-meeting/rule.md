In Scrum, meetings are time boxed. Team members should be well prepared in order to accomplish the meeting goals in time. 


<!--endintro-->

**Daily Scrum Meetings** - This is time boxed to 15 mins. All members of the team should be well prepared by:

* Being ready on time
* Having their "Remaining hours" up-to-date – read 
      [Do you update your tasks before the daily Scrum meeting?](/Pages/DailyScrumUpdateTasks.aspx)
* Be ready to answer the 3 main questions:



> > > What did you do yesterday? e.g. "Yesterday I did xxx"
> > > 
> > > What are you doing today? e.g. "Today I will do yyy"
> > > 
> > > Do you foresee any impediments or roadblocks? e.g. "I might hit a roadblock today because of xxx"


* Remember to say "Let's park that conversation for after the Daily Scrum". Major discussions are not to be conducted during the time boxed Scrum meeting.
* Being online on Skype (especially for team members in different locations).

**Review Meetings** - all members of the team must be well prepared by:

* Being available 
       **30 minutes** before the meeting
* Setting up and testing the projector with a computer before the meeting starts
* Making sure remote members are connected via Skype and/or TeamViewer before the meeting starts
* Nominating in advance another member of the team to take notes from the presentation
* Deciding, in advance, the order in which PBIs should be presented; priority, sprint backlog order, logical order and minimizing presenter and presentation medium switching should be taken into account.
* Controlling the time spent on the PBI presentation
    * Practice the demo beforehand if needed to ensure a succinct delivery. This can be in the form of a pre-prepared video if desired
    * Inform the product owner what the main goal of the PBI is and tell if the team believe it was done or not
    * If the Product Owner previously saw what was done, ideally the member should just mention that and ask if the PBI is accepted
    * If the member needs to show something, show a couple of examples and ask if the Product Owner wants to see something else


**Retrospective meetings** - all members of the team must be well prepared by:

* Having all your tasks from the last sprint closed
* Having your sprint feedback ready in advance, so members don’t need to think about it during the meeting, saving time
* Being clear and pointing out issues that need further discussions


**
Planning meetings** - all members of the team must be well prepared by:

* Having all bugs and PBIs up-to-date on the backlog
* Having all PBIs on the backlog “groomed” in order of priority (according to the Product Owner)
* Understanding all PBIs and the Product Owner’s priorities
* Being responsible on estimates
* Volunteering to work on PBIs and tasks, even if they are not related to your best skills – read
