Use Microsoft's **Test & Feedback extension** to perform exploratory tests on web apps directly from the browser.

Capture screenshots (and even videos), annotate them and submit bugs into Azure DevOps as you explore your web app - all directly from the Chrome browser (Edge and Firefox are also supported).

Test on any platform (Windows, Mac or Linux) on different devices - without the need for pre-defined test cases or test steps.
