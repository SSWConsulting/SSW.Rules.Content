<span class='intro'> Always give a heads up when you&#160;log in to someone else's account. Also, when you access a company account - which many people may&#160;use, like <strong>google</strong><strong>[at]ssw.com.au</strong> - send a heads&#160;up to that email so others know you are the one accessing it.<br><br> </span>

<p>A&#160;quick&#160;IM, SMS or email is enough to let the account owner know that you are the one accessing&#160;their account and it's not being hacked.​<br></p><dl class="image"><dt>
