Usually, when you notice some undesirable behaviour, you would generally give feedback directly, but sometimes there is a better way that can train both the person and also their direct manager:

<!--endintro-->

You can ask a manager for an "off the record" conversation where you can tell them something you have observed about the person they're managing and suggest that, if they agree, can they say something to the person?

This teaches the manager to observe these things and also helps the employee not to look bad (or get in trouble) from the boss. Then when/if the employee takes the feedback and it results in better actions in the next meeting, then you can compliment them publicly in the retro.
