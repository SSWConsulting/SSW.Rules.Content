ChatGPT's knowledge is cut off in September 2021, meaning it can't provide real-time or updated information beyond that date. It also can't interact with web content or perform complex computations on its own.



This is where ChatGPT plugins come into play. These powerful tools extend the capabilities of ChatGPT, enabling it to perform tasks such as browsing the web for the most recent information, interpreting content from various digital resources, and even performing complex computations. By leveraging these plugins, you can overcome the limitations of ChatGPT and significantly enhance its utility in the workplace.

Here's a rundown of some of the most useful plugins and how they can be beneficial in a work context.

## Inbuilt Browser Support in ChatGPT

ChatGPT has a built-in browser support that can perform searches on Bing to fetch up-to-date information. It's designed to pull in information from the web in real-time during a conversation. It's useful for quick lookups, fact-checking, or when you need to pull in fresh data from the web to answer a question.

For example, if you're asking about the current weather, the latest news, or recent sports scores, the native browsing functionality of ChatGPT would be used to fetch this real-time information. It's also used for general web searches when the assistant needs to pull in information from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive answer.

## WebPilot

WebPilot is used when there's a need to interact with a webpage in a more dynamic way. It can simulate browsing actions like clicking on links, filling out forms, or navigating through a website's pages. It's useful when the information you need can't be accessed directly from a single URL, but requires some interaction with the webpage. It can also be useful for some basic SEO advice.

For example, if you need to retrieve data that is behind a form submission or requires navigating through a multi-page article, WebPilot would be the appropriate tool to use.

## Link Reader

Link Reader, on the other hand, is more focused on extracting and interpreting information from a single static link. It's designed to understand and synthesize information from various digital resources, including web pages, PDF documents, PowerPoint presentations, images, Word files, and more. It's particularly useful when you need to read, summarize, or analyze the content of a specific link. 

For instance, if you have a URL to a specific online article or a PDF document and you want to get a summary or detailed understanding of its content, Link Reader would be the tool to use.

## AskYourPDF

If you have a PDF on your machine, not online, use AskYourPDF. It can open and read PDF files, extract text, figures, tables, and even metadata from them. It's an essential tool when you need to access, interpret, or summarize content from a PDF document.


For instance, if you have a PDF report and you need to extract certain tables or sections, or if you want to understand the overall content without going through the whole document, AskYourPDF is the perfect tool for the job.
