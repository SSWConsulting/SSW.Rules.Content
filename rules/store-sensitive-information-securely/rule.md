Keeping sensitive details like credit card numbers and passport information in unsecured places is risky. It can harm both the individuals involved and the organizationâ€™s reputation.

Ideally, avoid storing this information altogether. However, that is not always practical. Managers and CEOs often need to share these details with admin staff to book flights or arrange travel, for example. When that happens, make sure the information is stored and shared securely. Use encrypted files, password managers, or secure portals instead of emails, spreadsheets, or notes.

## Risks of insecure storage

Storing credit card details, passport information, or any sensitive data in unsecured fields exposes the organization to unnecessary risks.

### Data breach

* Credit card information and passport details are highly sought-after by cybercriminals. When this data is stored in an unsecure manner, the likelihood of it being accessed and misused by unauthorized parties increases significantly
* Should a data breach occur, the organization could face severe reputational damage, legal consequences, and financial penalties. <https://www.oaic.gov.au/about-the-OAIC/our-regulatory-approach/guide-to-privacy-regulatory-action/chapter-7-privacy-assessments>

### Non-compliance with data protection regulations

* Global and regional data protection regulations, such as GDPR in Europe, CCPA in California, and the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) under the Privacy Act 1988 in Australia, mandate strict guidelines on how personal and sensitive data should be stored and protected
* Storing such sensitive information in an insecure manner is a direct violation of these regulations, leading to hefty fines and legal action

### Data integrity and management issues

* Over time, unstructured and unsecured data can become outdated, redundant, or even be altered unintentionally
* Using Dynamics 365's notes field for such data means there's no systematic way to track its accuracy, validity, or history
