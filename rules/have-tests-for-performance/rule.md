Typically there are User Acceptance Tests that need to be written to measure the performance of your application. As a general rule of thumb, Forms should not load in more than 4 seconds. This can be automated with your unit testing framework.

<!--endintro-->

**Sample Code:**



```
public abstract class FormTestBase<F>
 where F : Form, new()
 {
 protected TimeSpan _ExpectedLoadTime = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(4);
 [Test]
 public void LoadTest()
 {
 Stopwatch stopwatch = new Stopwatch();
 stopwatch.Start();
 F testForm = new F();
 testForm.Show();
 testForm.Close();
 stopwatch.Stop();
 Console.WriteLine("Form [{0}] took {1:#,##0.0} seconds to open", typeof(F), stopwatch.Elapsed.TotalSeconds);
 Assert.IsTrue(stopwatch.Elapsed < _ExpectedLoadTime, 
 string.Format("Loading time ({0:#,##0.0} seconds) exceed the expected time ({1:#,##0.0} seconds).", 
 stopwatch.Elapsed.TotalSeconds, _ExpectedLoadTime.TotalSeconds));
 }
 }
 
 [TestFixture]
 public class LoginFormTests : FormTestBase<LoginForm>
 {
 }

 [TestFixture]
 public class MainFormTests : FormTestBase<MainForm>
 {
 }
```


 **Figure: This code tests that the LoginForm and MainForm load in under 4 seconds
