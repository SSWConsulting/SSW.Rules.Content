Hearing "No" from a customer or manager can feel like a dead end, but it can be an opportunity to refine your approach. A rejection doesn't mean they don't want your solution. It might just mean they don't yet see the value, have concerns, or need a different perspective.

<!--endintro-->

We recommend you use this objection handling model.

## Step 1: Understand the real reason behind the "No"

Before pushing back, we need to make sure that we understand why the person declined. Common reasons include:
- **Cost concerns** – The client sees your solution as too expensive
- **Timing issues** – A business isn't ready to implement the suggested solution
- **Misalignment with needs** – A client doesn't see how the solution fits into their business
- **Unclear value proposition** – The client doesn't understand the return on investment
- **Preexisting solution** - The client has an existing solution that currently meets their needs

Instead of immediately trying to resolve their issues with the solution, **ask questions** to understand their real hesitation:
::: greybox
"We can use a cheaper LLM to ensure the solution is within you're budget"
:::
::: Bad  
Figure: Bad example – Trying to resolve the issue by assuming the customers concerns
:::

::: greybox
  - "Can you help me understand what concerns you have with the current approach?"
  - "If I could resolve this issue for you, could we move forward?"
  - "Is it alright if I speak to one of my developers about it and let you know about that later today?"
:::
::: good  
Figure: Good examples – Asking the right questions helps you refine your response

## Step 2: Return with a better argument

Once you understand their objections, adjust your approach. Here's how:

### 1. If cost is an issue: show the ROI
   - Highlight long-term savings or increased revenue
   - Compare the cost of inaction
   - Offer a phased approach or a smaller-scale implementation

### 2. If timing is an issue: keep them engaged
   - Ask, "When would be a better time to revisit this?"

### 3. If they don't see the fit: provide better examples
   - Use case studies relevant to their industry
   - Show how similar clients have benefited
   - Incorporate the clients feedback and offer a more tailored solution

### 4. If they don't see the value: clarify your messaging
   - Simplify your explanation
   - Use visuals, data, or examples to reinforce your point
   - Focus on their issues rather than just listing features and benefits

## Step 3: Present with confidence

When you go back, don't just repeat your pitch **reframe it** based on what you've learned. Emphasise the value from their perspective, and make it clear you're there to solve the problem.

A typical objection we get is - "Why do you put 2 developers on the project? This is going to be more expensive isn't it?". This is how we regularly manage this question:

::: greybox
- Explain the benefits:

  - "We can complete the project sooner. Is that important to you?"
  - "You get more expertise - One person is more focussed on UI, the other person is stronger
    with databases"
  - "You get better quality code because the team are able to "put their heads together"
    to solve a problem - this saves maintenance costs down the track"
  - "We can continue working if 1 person gets sick"

- If they are still unsure, you can offer a small discount off the hourly rate, or
  offer some free support - it's all about managing risk.

## Step 4: Accept a final "No" with grace

If the client still says "No", accept it professionally. Leave the door open for future discussions:
::: greybox
"I appreciate your time and insights. If anything changes in the future, I'd love to revisit this conversation."

### Final thoughts

A "No" isn't always the end it's often just the beginning of a better conversation. Listen, refine, and come back stronger like [Steve Bucknor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bucknor).
