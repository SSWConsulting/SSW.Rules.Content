Nobody Likes a Slow Website. You should optimize the performance of your websites so it loads as quick as possible. 
<!--endintro-->

You should use     [Pingdom Website Speed Test](http&#58;//tools.pingdom.com/fpt/) to analyze the load speed of your websites and learn how to make them faster.

Then work to keep it under 3 MB:


* **Unacceptable**  &gt; 
          **3 MB**
* OK  **1.5 MB** to 
          **3 MB**  (apple.com is 1.5MB)
* Good &lt; 
          **1.5 MB**
* **Excellent**  &lt; 
          **1 MB**
