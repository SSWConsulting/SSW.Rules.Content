Reasons to release build your web applications before you deploy them with ASP.NET:

- ASP.NET conducts a batch compilation on "release builds", which means it tries to compile all files in the current folder into one DLL
- No resource caching is performed on debug build assemblies, which means that each request/response for a resource is not cached

According toÂ [MSDN web developer tips](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com), you can choose one of the following to release build your web application:

- In web.config file, set &lt;compilation debug="false"/&gt;
- Disable the &lt;compilation debug="true"/&gt; switch for all ASP.NET applications on the server by setting the following in Machine.config

<!--endintro-->

```xml
<system.web>
    <deployment retail="true"/>
</system.web>
```

::: good
The setting in machine.config will also turn off trace output in a page and detailed error messages remotely
:::

Machine.config file is typically located at `%SystemRoot%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\%VersionNumber%\CONFIG`.
