### Steps to Handle Passive Aggressive Comments

#### 1. Acknowledge the Subtext

Begin by reflecting what you sense in their comment. Use phrases like:

* "It sounds like there’s more to that."
* "It seems like you’re holding something back."
* "It sounds like there’s more for me to understand about what you just said."

These responses show that you recognize a deeper concern without escalating the situation.

#### 2. Seek Clarification

Ask, “Should I read into that?”

* This invites the person to clarify their statement
* Even if they respond “no,” they’ll be more mindful in future conversations knowing that their comments won’t be ignored

#### 3. Address Feelings Directly

Ask, “How are you feeling?”— genuinely and calmly

* Many people use passive aggression because they struggle to express their feelings openly
* Discussing emotions can lead to a more honest and constructive dialogue

### Why This Works

1. **De-escalation:** Acknowledging subtext without reacting defensively creates a safe space for honest communication
2. **Clarity:** Direct questions about feelings or intent eliminate misunderstandings
3. **Resolution:** Focusing on emotions often uncovers the root issue, enabling you to address it collaboratively

By approaching passive aggressive comments with these strategies, you can maintain professionalism, encourage openness, and build stronger team dynamics.
