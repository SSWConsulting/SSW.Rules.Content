Use Label controls to display static text of the application. Eg. "Customer ID:"
Use Text Box controls to display data (results of calculations, information, records from a database, etc.).

The reasons are:

* users know it is data, not a label of the application
* users can copy and paste from the field

PS: One reason web UI's are nice, is that the information is always selectable/copyable.

As you can see you'll barely know the difference, so start using Textboxes for displaying data, that's good practice.

#### More Information
