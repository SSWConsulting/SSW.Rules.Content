Pull requests are a fundamental feature of collaborative software development, allowing contributors to propose changes to a project and receive feedback from other developers. When reviewing a pull request, it can be tempting to make additional changes beyond those requested by PR creator. 

Knowing that these addional edits might not be reviewed by anyone else, it's crucial to make sure the changes are **correct**, **necessary** and **beneficial** to the project before adding them.

If whatever you want to change can serve as a learning opportunity to others, it is best if you ask them to action by [requesting a change](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/reviewing-proposed-changes-in-a-pull-request).

Most common scenarios where editing an existing PR is encouraged:

* Fixing typos
* Grammar improvements
* Formatting (Markdown) fixes/improvements

::: info
**Warning:** Only experts should add changes to a PR. Never make extra changes to a PR if you are less experienced or unfamiliar with the project. The additional changes may be unnecessary or even harmful.
:::

Ultimately, the decision to add additional changes to a pull request should be made based on the needs of the project and the expertise of the contributors involved. It's important to carefully consider the impact of any additional changes and ensure that they are aligned with the standards.
