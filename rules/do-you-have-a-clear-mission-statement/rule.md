To ensure everyone is on the same page, you can create a&#160;mission statement&#160;that continually drives your marketing plan. Is a short statement&#160;that outlines why your&#160;organization exists, what&#160;its&#160;overall goal is and it identifies&#160;the goal of its operations, e.g.&#160;what kind of product or service it provides, its primary customers or market, and its geographical region of operation&#160;and target audience.&#160;<br>
