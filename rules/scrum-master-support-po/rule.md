When working with a client-side Product Owner (PO), it’s crucial for the Scrum Master to come from the consultancy. Typically, the consultant Scrum Master has more experience in Agile and Scrum methodologies than the client PO. This experience can significantly impact the success of the project by providing essential guidance and support to the PO in their key responsibilities.

Without proper support, the PO might struggle with critical tasks like backlog management, prioritisation, and stakeholder communication, which can lead to misaligned expectations, missed deadlines, and reduced product quality.

### The Scrum Master's Role in Supporting the Product Owner

#### 1. **Product Vision and Goals**

One of the key roles of the Product Owner is to establish and maintain a clear product vision and goals. The Scrum Master ensures the PO understands the importance of this responsibility and helps facilitate the necessary workshops or discussions to create a clear and actionable product vision.

#### 2. **Stakeholder Identification and Engagement**

A Product Owner needs to identify key stakeholders and maintain ongoing communication with them. The Scrum Master can assist by coaching the PO on effective stakeholder engagement and providing insights into managing expectations and priorities.

#### 3. **Backlog Management**

The Product Backlog is the backbone of any Scrum project. The Scrum Master should guide the PO in:
* Defining and prioritising backlog items effectively
* Ensuring that user stories are clear, actionable, and aligned with the product vision
* Keeping the backlog organised and up-to-date

#### 4. **Sprint-by-Sprint Collaboration**

During the sprint, the Scrum Master helps the PO with the following essential activities:
* **Backlog Refinement**: Ensuring that the backlog is properly groomed and stories are ready for future sprints.
* **Sprint Planning**: Collaborating with the PO to prioritise the most valuable work for the upcoming sprint.
* **Daily Stand-Ups**: Supporting the PO in understanding the team’s progress and removing impediments.
* **Sprint Reviews**: Assisting the PO in reviewing and accepting the work completed during the sprint.
* **Sprint Retrospectives**: Encouraging the PO’s involvement in retrospectives to identify process improvements.

#### 5. **Metrics and Roadmap Alignment**

The Scrum Master should help the PO establish key metrics to measure the product’s progress. This includes defining success criteria, tracking the team's velocity, and adjusting the product roadmap accordingly.

#### 6. **Release Planning**

By working closely with the PO, the Scrum Master ensures that the product releases are aligned with the goals of the business and the needs of the users. Together, they coordinate on the release dates and manage the expectations of stakeholders.

### Supporting Beyond the Sprint

#### 1. **Risk and Change Management**

Projects often encounter risks and changes, which need to be managed properly. The Scrum Master should coach the PO on how to identify and mitigate risks early and how to effectively communicate changes to the development team and stakeholders.

#### 2. **Training and Support**

It’s common for a client-side Product Owner to be relatively new to Scrum. The Scrum Master should take on the responsibility of training the PO, offering guidance, and providing ongoing support. This ensures the PO grows in their role and becomes more effective over time.

### Conclusion

A Scrum Master plays a vital role in supporting the Product Owner by offering expertise in Agile practices, helping manage the product backlog, and ensuring stakeholder engagement. When the Scrum Master effectively supports the PO, it leads to better product outcomes, more efficient sprints, and clearer communication across the board.
