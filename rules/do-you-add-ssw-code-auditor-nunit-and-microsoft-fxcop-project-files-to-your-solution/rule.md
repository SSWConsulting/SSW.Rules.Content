[SSW Code Auditor](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/Default.aspx), [NUnit](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/DeveloperGeneral/netTools.aspx#NUnit) and [Microsoft FxCop](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/DeveloperGeneral/netTools.aspx#FxCop) are tools to keep your code "healthy". That is why they should be easily accessible in every solution so that they can be run with a double click of a mouse button.
