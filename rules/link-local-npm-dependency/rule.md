When working on multiple related JavaScript projects, you may need to test changes in a local dependency without publishing it to npm. `npm link` provides a way to symlink a local package, allowing real-time updates without reinstalling the package manually. However, improper usage can lead to issues like dependency mismatches or unresolved modules.

### How `npm link` Works

`npm link` creates a symbolic link between a globally registered local package and a project that depends on it.

#### Steps to Link a Local Dependency

1. Navigate to the local package directory (the dependency you are developing) and run:
   
   ```sh
   npm link
   ```
   
   This registers the package globally on your system.

2. Navigate to the project that will use this dependency and run:
   
   ```sh
   npm link <package-name>
   ```
   
   This links the globally registered package into your projectâ€™s `node_modules`.

#### Example Usage

If you're developing `my-local-package` and want to use it in another project:

```sh
cd ~/projects/my-local-package
npm link
cd ~/projects/my-app
npm link my-local-package
```

Now, `my-app` will use the local version of `my-local-package` instead of fetching it from npm.

### Common Issues and Fixes

- **Module Resolution Issues**: If your project uses a different version of a peer dependency than the linked package, you might get errors. A common fix is running:
  
  ```sh
  npm install
  ```
  
  in both the linked package and the main project.

- **TypeScript Not Detecting Changes**: Sometimes, TypeScript may not immediately recognize changes in a linked package. Restarting the TypeScript server (`tsc --watch`) or adding `"preserveSymlinks": true` in `tsconfig.json` can help.

### Alternatives to `npm link`

#### 1. Using `npm install <path>`
Instead of linking, you can install a local package directly:

```sh
npm install ../my-local-package
```

Figure: Good Example (Simpler alternative that avoids symlink-related issues)

#### 2. Using `npm pack`
Another option is to create a tarball of the package and install it manually:

```sh
cd my-local-package
npm pack
npm install ../my-local-package/my-local-package-1.0.0.tgz
```

Figure: Good Example (Simulates a real npm package installation)

### Best Practices

- Use `npm link` mainly for development, not for production environments.
- Always verify dependencies are correctly installed after linking.
- Consider `npm install <path>` or `npm pack` if `npm link` causes issues.

By understanding and properly using `npm link`, you can streamline local package development while avoiding common pitfalls.
