<span class='intro'> <p>Code Coverage shows how much of your code is covered by tests and can be a useful tool for showing how effective your unit testing strategy is.&#160; However, it should be looked at with caution.​​<br></p> </span>

<ul><li>You should focus on <strong>*quality*</strong> not <strong>*quantity*</strong> of tests.</li><li>You should write tests for fragile code first and not waste time testing trivial methods</li><li>Remember the 80-20 rule - a very high-test coverage is a noble goal but there are diminishing returns.</li><li>If you're modifying code, write&#160;the test first, then change the code, then run the test to make sure it passes (AKA red-green-refactor).</li><li>You should run your tests regularly (see <a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=53774ecb-3e5b-4985-89e9-3a57c2737e4c">Do you follow a Test Driven Process</a>).
