Code Coverage shows how much of your code is covered by tests and can be a useful tool for showing how effective your unit testing strategy is.  However, it should be looked at with caution.

<!--endintro-->

* You should focus on  **\*quality\*** not  **\*quantity\*** of tests.
* You should write tests for fragile code first and not waste time testing trivial methods
* Remember the 80-20 rule - a very high-test coverage is a noble goal but there are diminishing returns.
* If you're modifying code, write the test first, then change the code, then run the test to make sure it passes (AKA red-green-refactor).
* You should run your tests regularly (see [Do you follow a Test Driven Process](/before-starting-do-you-follow-a-test-driven-process)). Ideally, they'll be part of your build (see [Do you know the minimum builds to create on any branch](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterVersionControlwithTFS%28AKASourceControl%29.aspx#MinimumBuilds))
