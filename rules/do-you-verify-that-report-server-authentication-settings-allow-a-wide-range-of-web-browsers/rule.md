The default configuration for Report Server isn't accessible by most mobile browsers and some desktop browsers too. You can adjust the authentication types allowed to increase the range.

<!--endintro-->

The configuration file for the Report Server is namedÂ RSReportServer.config and the default location is:

::: greybox
**C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSRS13.MSSQLSERVER\Reporting Services\ReportServer\**
:::

You should make a backup of the configuration before editing it so you can rollback if you make a mistake.

We normally change the AuthenticationTypes node from:

```html
<AuthenticationTypes>
  <RSWindowsNegotiate /> 
</AuthenticationTypes> 
```

to:   

```html
<AuthenticationTypes>
  <RSWindowsNegotiate /> 
  <RSWindowsKerberos /> 
  <RSWindowsNTLM /> 
</AuthenticationTypes> 
```

Check out the different [Authentication Types in the Report Server documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/sql/sql-server-2008-r2/cc281310(v=sql.105)?redirectedfrom=MSDN) and select the types that suit your needs.

More details on configuring Windows authentication on the report server can be found here: [Configure Windows Authentication on the Report Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/reporting-services/security/configure-windows-authentication-on-the-report-server).
