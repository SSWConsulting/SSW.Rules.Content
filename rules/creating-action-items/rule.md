The aim of most meetings should be to come up with next steps. These should be shared with the intended recipient, as well as CCing all other attendees.

It is a good idea to have a scribe who is drafting the action points during the meeting, so if it's not already clear who that is, say "Who will be the scribe?" at the beginning of any meeting.

The leader should allow time after the meeting to check the action points before their next meeting.

The scribe should also document the decision-making process by writing down each person's arguments. After everyone comments on the options, the notes can be reviewed as a group and often the best course of action is clear. 

Common action items include:

<!--endintro-->

* The outcomes from agenda points marked as “for decision”
* [Off topics that require more discussion](/keep-track-of-a-parking-lot-for-topics) by subsets of the meeting’s attendees – aka a “parking lot”
* Ad hoc tasks that come up from brainstorming, usually sent as separate email tasks or created as PBIs in a backlog
* A date scheduled for the next meeting (if needed)
