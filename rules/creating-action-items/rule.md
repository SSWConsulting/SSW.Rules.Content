The goal of most meetings should be to establish clear next steps. These action items should be shared with the intended recipients, with all other attendees CC'd.

It's beneficial to designate a scribe who drafts action points during the meeting and **assigns them directly to those responsible for completing the tasks**. If the scribe hasn't been identified at the start, simply ask: _"Who will be the scribe?"_

The scribe should also document the decision-making process by writing down each person's arguments. After everyone comments on the options, the notes can be reviewed as a group and often the best course of action is clear.

Common action items include:

<!--endintro-->

* The outcomes from agenda points marked as ‚Äúfor decision‚Äù
* [Off topics that require more discussion](/keep-track-of-a-parking-lot-for-topics) by subsets of the meeting‚Äôs attendees ‚Äì aka a ‚Äúparking lot‚Äù
* Ad hoc tasks that come up from brainstorming, usually sent as separate email tasks or created as PBIs in a backlog
* Scheduling the next meeting, if necessary

If you are in a Teams meeting, the best place to put notes is the meeting Notes tab because it keeps the meeting notes with the context of the meeting:

## Option 1: The Notes tab

In Microsoft Teams, the scribe can use the **Notes** tab during the meeting to add details and list follow-up tasks.

The meeting organiser should allow time after the meeting to check the action points before their next meeting. This can seen as a summary page at the end of the meeting.

If you're in a regular Teams call rather than a scheduled meeting and don‚Äôt have access to the Notes tab, you can still effectively manage action items with these options:

## Option 2: Quick and dirty

During the call, type your key action items or decisions directly into a Teams message.

Once you've noted everything down, ask everyone in the call to "Like" üëç the message if they agree with the summary.

This helps ensure consensus and provides a quick way to confirm that everyone is on the same page without the overhead of creating a new Loop.

## Option 3: Loop it up

For more detailed or complex notes, create a new Loop page and share the link with the group.

As the discussion progresses, use the Loop to collaboratively edit and refine the notes.

After the meeting, once you've created PBIs (Product Backlog Items) or other tasks based on the notes, remember to "zz" (mark as obsolete) the Loop notes and include a link to the corresponding PBIs.

This prevents anyone from accidentally editing the old notes without realizing that a newer, finalized version exists.
