The goal of most meetings should be to establish clear next steps. These action items should be shared with the intended recipients, with all other attendees CC'd.

It's beneficial to designate a scribe who drafts action points during the meeting and **assigns them directly to those responsible for completing the tasks**. If the scribe hasn't been identified at the start, simply ask, "Who will be the scribe?"

In Microsoft Teams, the scribe can use the **Notes** tab during the meeting to add details and list follow-up tasks.

The meeting organiser should allow time after the meeting to check the action points before their next meeting. This can seen as a summary page at the end of the meeting.

The scribe should also document the decision-making process by writing down each person's arguments. After everyone comments on the options, the notes can be reviewed as a group and often the best course of action is clear.

Common action items include:

- The outcomes from agenda points marked as “for decision”
- [Off topics that require more discussion](/keep-track-of-a-parking-lot-for-topics) by subsets of the meeting’s attendees – aka a “parking lot”
- Ad hoc tasks that come up from brainstorming, usually sent as separate email tasks or created as PBIs in a backlog
- Scheduling the next meeting, if necessary
