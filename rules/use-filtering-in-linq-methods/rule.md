Many LINQ methods like Count, First and so on include an optional filter parameter. It's normally much more readable to use this than add an extra call to Where

<!--endintro-->

```cs
.Where(x => x < 5).Count()
.Where(x => x < 5).FirstOrDefault()
```

::: bad
Figure: Bad example - More code that requires extra thought to understand.
:::

```cs
.Count(x => x < 5)
.FirstOrDefault(x => x < 5)
```

::: good
Figure: Good example - Shorter and easier to read.
