According to the Scrum Alliance, "Scrum" is capitalized.

<!--endintro-->

You will occasionally see it in:

* not capitalized (scrum) - this is incorrect
* all caps (SCRUM) - this is incorrect, as Scrum is not an acronym

Other Scrum terms should also be capitalized:
- Sprint
- Product Owner
- Scrum Master
- Product Backlog
- Sprint Review
- Sprint Planning
- Sprint Retrospective
