According to the Scrum Alliance, "Scrum" is capitalized.

<!--endintro-->

You will occasionally see it written incorrectly:

❌ scrum - Not capitalized

❌ SCRUM - All caps (incorrect, as Scrum is not an acronym)

Other Scrum terms should also be capitalized:

- Sprint
- Product Owner
- Scrum Master
- Product Backlog
- Sprint Review
- Sprint Planning
- Sprint Retrospective
