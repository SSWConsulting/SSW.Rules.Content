### Less is more

To ensure effective written communication, it's crucial to embrace the principle of "less is more". By being concise and focusing on relevant information only, we can capture the reader's attention and prevent important messages from being overlooked or postponed due to time constraints. So, let's keep it **short**, **direct**, and **to the point**, ensuring our messages are accessible and impactful, even for busy individuals on the go.
