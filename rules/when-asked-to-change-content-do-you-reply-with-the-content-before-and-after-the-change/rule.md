Your boss asks you to change a page on your website. You discuss it with your team and come up with the changes. Wouldn't it be nice if your boss could see exactly what was changed?

<!--endintro-->

Always keep a copy of what the page (or document) looked like before you make the change, and reply to the original email with the "before" and "after.
