<span class='intro'> <div style="text-align&#58;justify;">Endomarketing is one of the most effective strategies to reduce your employee turnover rate and attract new highly qualified professionals to your company. <br></div><div style="text-align&#58;justify;"><br></div><div style="text-align&#58;justify;">This strategy is mainly directed at creating an image of a great workplace and making people feel like their current position is a dream job. The prefix ‘endo’ comes from the Greek meaning &quot;inside,&quot; therefore Endomarketing in a business environment is targeted at your employees. <br></div><div style="text-align&#58;justify;"><br></div><div style="text-align&#58;justify;">You can also call this Internal Marketing, as it seeks to improve the image of the company among its employees, culminating in a motivated team and reduced turnover.</div><div><br></div> </span>

<div style="text-align&#58;justify;">Many companies invest a lot of time, resources and money to attract and retain customers, but sometimes they completely forget about their own workers. After implementing a new successful strategy for your internal marketing, you should see a lift in your team’s perception of the company and they will begin to see the company in a more human and charismatic way; often developing a feeling of &quot;adoration&quot; for the business.</div><div style="text-align&#58;justify;"><div>
