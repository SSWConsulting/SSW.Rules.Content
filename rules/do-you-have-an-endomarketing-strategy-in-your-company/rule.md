<div style="text-align:justify;">Endomarketing is one of the most effective strategies to reduce your employee turnover rate and attract new highly qualified professionals to your company. <br></div><div style="text-align:justify;"><br></div><div style="text-align:justify;">This strategy is mainly directed at creating an image of a great workplace and making people feel like their current position is a dream job. The prefix ‘endo’ comes from the Greek meaning "inside," therefore Endomarketing in a business environment is targeted at your employees. <br></div><div style="text-align:justify;"><br></div><div style="text-align:justify;">You can also call this Internal Marketing, as it seeks to improve the image of the company among its employees, culminating in a motivated team and reduced turnover.</div><div><br></div>
