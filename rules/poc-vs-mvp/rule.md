It is really important to understand the difference between a Proof of Concept (POC) and a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). It is also important that clients understand the difference so they know what to expect.

<!--endintro-->

A POC is a proof of concept, usually developed quickly and with a single concept in mind. It is used to demonstrate the feasibility of a concept or idea. It is not intended to be a complete product or even a slice of a complete product. It is usually used to prove a new architecture, technology, or approach to a problem.

POCs should be build, tested, and thrown away. They are **not intended to be used in a production environment**.

A MVP is a slice of a complete product. It usually covers a single feature end to end, and deployed to production. These are usually developed with more care and attention to detail than a POC as they will be used in a production environment.
