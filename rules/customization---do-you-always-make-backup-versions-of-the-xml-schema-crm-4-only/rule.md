<span class='intro'> <p>When the XML schema is published it re-generates the underlying SQL and .aspx code. If trouble hits, a &quot;refresh&quot; or &quot;rollback&quot; to an uncorrupted schema is always a backup plan. A versioning scheme is also required to keep track of different versions of the XML schema at different points in time. To make a backup of the schema from within Microsoft CRM navigate to Settings -&gt; Customization -&gt; Export Customizations. Browse to the location on your personal hard drive where the .XML file is to be stored. </p> </span>

<p><strong>Tip #1&#58;</strong> Export only the customizations of entities that you customize and keep each entity customizations in a separate file, see the rule&#58;<a href="/Pages/Only-export-the-customizations-and-related-ones-that-you-have-made.aspx">Customization</a><span></span><span> - Do you export only the customizations of entities that you did customize?</span></p>
<p><strong>Tip #2&#58;</strong> Put the date on the file names and while you are working you will be doing this multiple times a day. </p>
<p><strong>Tip #3&#58;</strong> don't save this on the Dev Virtual Machine. </p><p>In CRM 2011 we use Solutions and TFS Source Control.</p>
