  <p>​​​Most devs don't send 'Done' emails. Do you really expect Product Owners to always be checking TFS?<br>
<br>
The better approach is&#58;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;- If task/bug came from a client, when it is completed, send&#160;the 'Done'&#160;email to Product Owner.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;-&#160;If the task/bug is your breakdown of a PBI&#160;(that the developer did to break down a big user story), then only send the ‘Done’ once the entire user story is complete.<br>
<strong>Note</strong>&#58; Send the ‘Done’ email to the <a shape="rect" href="/Pages/OwnerForEveryUserStory.aspx" target="_blank">Owner of that&#160;PBI</a>.</p>
<h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Don​​​e tips&#58;</h3>
<p>- Include the Task #, Summary and link to the item in TWA. <br>
-&#160;Remember that all your tasks should be under 4 hours<br>
-&#160;Follow the Done Email rules<br>
-&#160;If you completed the task in a different way than previously discussed, mention it. <br>
-&#160;Make sure that every PBI&#160;has an Owner as per the rules.</p>

  <h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">If you are w​orking on a task&#58;</h3>
<p>When you complete a Task that is part of a PBI you need to send a done email to the <a shape="rect" href="/Pages/OwnerForEveryUserStory.aspx" target="_blank"><font color="#000080">Owner of that Story</font></a>.</p>
<p>You only need to add the Task #, Summary and link to the item in WIWA. Remember that all your tasks should be <a shape="rect" href="/Pages/BreakLargeTasks.aspx" target="_blank"><font color="#000080">under 4 hours</font></a>, do spending&#160;lots of time on a <a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=29d5ca5d-c191-475f-8db2-0086c44ca46c" shape="rect" target="_blank"><font color="#000080">Done Email</font></a> for a Task would be counter productive.&#160;Add more information if required, for example you may have completed the task a different way than previously discussed.&#160; </p>
<p>Make sure that <a shape="rect" href="/Pages/OwnerForEveryUserStory.aspx" target="_blank"><font color="#000080">every PBI has an Owner</font></a> as per the rules.<br></p>
<h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">If you are th​e owner of a PBI&#58;</h3>
<p>When the last task/bug of a PBI&#160;is complete, you then send a <a shape="rect" href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=29d5ca5d-c191-475f-8db2-0086c44ca46c" target="_blank"><font color="#000080">comprehensive done email</font></a> as per the rules when the story had been completed. Make sure you add a list of all of the Tasks that were completed as part of the story and the Done criteria that you completed.</p>
