Sometimes, you get a cryptic email and think, "what on earth!". That's why it is important to [seek clarification with a call](/do-you-seek-clarification-via-the-telephone-first)

Other times you send an email and get a response saying it's too cryptic. So, before you send an email, think about what context and reasoning the receiver will need to know, and add it to your email.

Never assume that others will understand anyways. When sending an email it is very important to have context and reasoning, and make yourself as clear as possible. This way anyone can understand your emails at any time in the future.  Make sure there are always enough details in the thread for anyone else to acknowledge what is going on.

A nice way to provide extra clear information is by adding links and [screenshots with useful captions](/add-useful-and-concise-figure-captions).
