Never assume that others will understand anyways. When sending an email it is very important to have context and reasoning, and make yourself as clear as possible. This way anyone can understand your emails at any time in the future.  Make sure there are always enough details in the thread for anyone else to acknowledge what is going on.

A nice way to provide extra clear information is by adding links and [screenshots with useful captions](/add-useful-and-concise-figure-captions).
