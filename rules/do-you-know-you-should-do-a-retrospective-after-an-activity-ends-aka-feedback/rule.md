<p class="p1">Feedback is an important commodity to any professional who wants to improve their game.​</p><p class="p1">Notes you take during meetings, presentations, user group, etc., can serve you well as reminders of what happened during an activity. There will be things you like and things you do not.&#160;</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>​It is very important you write this down and discuss it with people in the room or with the presenter (if it was a presentation or user group). This will help everyone to understand what was good and what needs to improve.​</p><dl class="goodImage"><dt><img src="/Communication/RulesToBetterCommunication/PublishingImages/activity-feedback.jpg" alt="" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good Example - Danijel took notes during the FireBootCamp Gala Day presentation and sent them to Adam​</dd></dl>
