<span class='intro'> <p>Email signatures are great when they&#58;<br></p><ul><li>Have a little&#160;branding&#160;and&#160;advertising&#160;(can be a tagline or company news), so people know instantly who it is from</li><li>Include your phone number (in international format - it's important to add the country code so people from all around the world can easily add you&#160;to their contacts)</li><li>Include the company website link</li><li>Include work-related&#160;social media and blog link</li>
   <li>Include your position and city/country&#160;where you are based <br></li></ul> </span>

<h3>Long Signature</h3><p> 
   <b>Use the complete &quot;long signature&quot; when sending a new email to a client.</b> </p><p>This is created in HTML and goes well on emails with Word used as the email editor. Include some product advertising and rotate on a monthly basis to coincide with what's on your homepage and monthly newsletter. It should have the com pany colors&#160;somewhere.<br></p><dl class="image"><dt> <img src="/SiteAssets/great-email-signatures/outlook-signature.png" alt="outlook-signature.png" style="max-width&#58;100%;" /> <br>
   </dt><dd>Figure&#58; A great long signature</dd></dl> <span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">However, you shouldn't use your long&#160;signature on <b>every</b> sent email. It's recommended to have simpler versions of it for different cases&#58;</span>
<h3>Short Signature<br></h3><p>
   <b>Use the &quot;short signature&quot; when replying to a client's email.&#160;</b></p><p> 
   <span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">It just includes your name, phone number and URL.&#160;</span></p> ​ 
<h3>Mobile Signature <br></h3><p>
   <strong>Use the &quot;mobile signature&quot; when using you iPhone/Windows Phone/Android.</strong></p><p>When you send emails via mobile, always include the &quot;Sent from my iPhone/BlackBerry/Mobile Device&quot; signature.</p><p>This means the recipient of the email knows you are writing on the fly and won't be as upset if you make little spelling mistakes or use acronyms.</p><dl class="image"><dt> <img src="/PublishingImages/obama-typing.jpg" alt="obama-typing.jpg" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Let people know you are using a mobile device. You hope they will be more forgiving of minor typo's or acronyms.</dd></dl><h3>No Signature</h3><p>
   <strong>Use a really short signature (your first name or initials) or no signature at all in internal emails</strong> as people already know who you are.</p><p> 
   <b>Note #1&#58;</b> Use the short&#160;signature as your default in Outlook Web Access.<br><b>Note #2&#58;</b> You can see Ulysses using this rule in practice, along with other&#160;best practices, on this short <a href="http&#58;//www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAqRokqq4jI">demonstration video.</a> </p><h3>More Information</h3><h4>How to set it up in Outlook</h4><ol><li>Open Microsoft Outlook and go File | Options</li><li>Click the &quot;Mail&quot; tab as seen below</li><li>Click on &quot;Signatures...&quot; and add in your signatures</li></ol><dl class="image"><dt> <img src="https&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/images/Outlook2013_signature.jpg" alt="" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; How to add a signature in Outlook</dd></dl><h4>How to set it up in OWA</h4><ol><li>Open OWA (e.g. http&#58;//mail.northind.com/owa)</li><li>Click &quot;Options&quot; on the top right side. <br></li><li>Go Settings | Mail and make followin g changes&#58; <br></li></ol><dl class="image"><dt> <img src="/SiteAssets/great-email-signatures/owa-signatures.png" alt="owa-signatures.png" style="max-width&#58;100%;" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Add your 'E-Mail Signature' and save<br></dd></dl><p>
   <strong>Warning&#58;</strong>&#160;Unfortunately you need to setup up your signature in Outlook and OWA. There is no way to share this.&#160;<br><strong style="line-height&#58;1.6;"> Tip&#58;</strong><span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">&#160;You can automatically have your Outlook signature changed on </span>sign-<span style="line-height&#58;1.6;">in via a script.
