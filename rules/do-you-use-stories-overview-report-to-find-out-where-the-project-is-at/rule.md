  <p>A common question for every project manager is &quot;where is my project at&quot;? This question isn't just asked to find out how many tasks are done, but also to understand if all these tasks are done to meet users' requirements. </p>
<p>TFS2010's Agile Template provides a built-in &quot;Stories Overview&quot; report to help you find out where the project is at, as well as to tell you if all the tasks are well tested. </p>

<p>Tip&#58; Set this up on a <a href="/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/DailyReportsEmailedToTeam.aspx" shape="rect">daily schedule so the Scrum Team get this in their inbox each day</a>.</p>
<p>Suggestion for Microsoft #1&#58; Add a Summary Number in large font at the top, eg. 55% complete. </p>
<p>Suggestion for Microsoft #2&#58; Add this great report to the Microsoft Scrum TFS Process Template.</p>
