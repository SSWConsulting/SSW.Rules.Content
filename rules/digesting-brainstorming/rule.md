The Brainstorming day is a lot of fun, but its important all the outcomes are captured and acted on.
Once you have everyone's thoughts on the ideas, they need to be digested into actionable items.

<!--endintro-->

Create a PBI or send a task for every item that the Brainstorming team decides is valuable.

Send a summary of what was implemented to the company with links to the PBIs.

**Tip:** Tag all issues with a 'brainstorming' label to make it easy to track them across projects.
