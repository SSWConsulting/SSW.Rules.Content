Blazor lets you build interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript. Blazor apps are composed of reusable web UI components implemented using C#, HTML, and CSS. Both client and server code is written in C#, allowing you to share code and libraries.

Blazor lets developers escape from all the pain of JavaScript frameworks. Blazor is also much easier to learn for developers coming from a backend language as it uses C#.
