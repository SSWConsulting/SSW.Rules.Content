**Zeplin** provides designers with an organised workspace where they can publish their work and allow the entire team to collaborate on a project.

<!--endintro-->

This software allows developers to view mockups with selectable elements â€“ even displaying snippets of HTML and CSS that can be pasted right into a project 
or simply used as a helpful reference point. Users can also leave comments and notes on mockups to serve as reminders or points of feedback. 

Using the Zeplin plugin for Sketch, designers can easily export not only their mockups but any important symbols and assets they created or included. 
With Zeplin styleguides developers have easy access to a library of the colours and reusable design elements of any given project.
