One of the many reasons Figma is the most recommended software for designing user experience is Figma made the design process (handover and feedback) more open and inclusive. By enabling more people to contribute and share feedback, teams can create more creative and comprehensive solutions that reflect a wider range of perspectives.

**Sharing a Figma file is as easy as sharing a link.** Figma is a multifaceted tool that provides designers with a shared project space where they can publish their work and allow the entire team to collaborate on a project. Editors can manage permissions and should invite viewers or collaborators to a project as needed. Interactive prototypes are treated as a separate file and can be shared using their own specific links too. 

## Share design work with collaborators
Developers, clients, or any other collaborators can use Figma to view mockups with selectable elements and interactive prototypes. The inspect tab allows viewers to access size or spacing measurements plus code snippets generated from the designs - for iOS, Android, and CSS  - that can be copied right into a project. Developers can also take advantage of a project's components and styles to dive into all the reusable elements or variables that have been created. Anyone who has access to a Figma file can easily export not only whole frames, but any symbols and assets a designer has crafted or included in the file.

## Get feedback for your design work
Team members can easily add and reply to comments on files and prototypes using the browser or Figma desktop and even on Figma mobile app. Figma also let your comment to be pinned in a selected location on canvas. You can also mention collaborators to your messages.

When you've reached an agreement, or have resolved an issue, remember to resolve the comment. Figma will remove the comment icon from the prototype to make your canvas clean and tidy. 

Note: resolved comments can be turned back on by showing resolved comments on the prototype.
