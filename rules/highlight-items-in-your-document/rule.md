When highlighting items (file names, user commands etc.) be sure to:

<!--endintro-->

1. Distinguish the items from the rest of the surrounding text; and
2. Be consistent.





Use the following rules to highlight items in your document.






| Style | Use this style on | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Bold text**  | Menus, commands, dialog box options, file names and paths | To access the application, click  **Start | Programs | Accessories | System Tools | Disk Defragmenter**  |
| UPPER CASE | Code keywords and database elements | Use the INNER JOIN clause in SQL Server to join one table to another. |
| **Initial Capitals + Bold**  | File paths and file names | 	Now open  **C:\My Documents\Invoice.doc.**  |
| Monospace (Courier New font) | Code samples, error messages | You will see the following error: error opening database: database is currently in use. |




Remember: Never Underline the text when it isn't a link as per the rule:Â [Do you use underlines only on links?](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/standards/rules/RulesToBetterWebsitesNavigation.aspx#DontUseUnderlines)
