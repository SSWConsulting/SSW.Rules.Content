When you're working, you will encounter issues that block you from progressing, force you to do a lot of research or otherwise spend time building towards being able to complete your work. In these moments, the question arises, "When should I ask for help?"

## Something Measurable

As everyone's struggles are different and everyone's way of handling pressure is different, it's hard to provide a useful metric for precisely when to ask for help. However, here's a general rule to follow:

1. Find the smallest 'significant' amount of work that your project can allocate. In Scrum, this would be the smallest effort value (Extra-Small if using shirt sizes)
2. If you spend that amount of time trying to work out the problem, you **should** ask for help
