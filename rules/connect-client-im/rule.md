Effective communication with your clients on Microsoft Teams builds credibility, trust and ensures they receive the deserved attention.

# Do you know why it’s important to talk with clients on Teams? 

Microsoft Teams is an excellent channel for communicating with clients, especially at the early stage of client development, like after the initial meeting. It encourages the client to reach out and ask you anything about the business, an upcoming spec review and vice versa. This impresses the client and brings your business closer to a Specification Review.

In other words, Microsoft Teams = buddies :-)

## Microsoft Teams Context
SSW has an open Microsoft 365 (tenant), which means any external email address can communicate with SSW via SSW Teams. However, some organisations have a closed tenant, meaning you can only communicate via Teams with their organisation’s consent.

### Getting started
Once you’ve arranged an Initial Meeting or before a Spec Review, follow these steps to begin communicating with your client on teams.

1. Open Microsoft Teams
2. Open a ‘New Client’ chat or press (Control + N)
3. Enter the client’s email address
4. Create the chat

### If the client has an open tenant, you should send an open tenant request email.

#### Open Tenant Email   
Subject: Communication via Microsoft Teams

Dear [client]

I hope you’re well.

As discussed earlier, we should use Microsoft Teams to chat because it ensures quick responses to your queries.

No development question is too big or too small so don’t hesitate to reach out.

Thanks

### If the client has a closed tenant, you should send a closed tenant request email.

#### Closed Tenant Email
Subject: Communication via Microsoft Teams

Dear [client]

As discussed earlier, we should use Microsoft Teams to chat because it ensures quick responses to your queries.

No development question is too big or too small so don’t hesitate to reach out.

Because your Microsoft 365 tenant is ‘closed’, we’ll need your IT team to add my email address to your server.

Please copy them into this email chain so I can request access.
