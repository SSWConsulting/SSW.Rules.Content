<span class='intro'> <div>Sending appointments from Teams feels less natural than from Outlook&#160;but there are some great&#160;benefits&#58;<br> 
   <ul><li>Appointment - &#160;You don’t need to remember everyone’s name - The whole team is invited</li><li>Appointment - In the appointment, it auto-generates a link so that everyone goes to the right place to attend</li><li>Visibility - It shows up in Teams Calendar</li><li>Visibility - It appears in the Teams chat (for the channel that was invited)</li><li>Visibility – When the appointment is beginning the app&#160;pops up with a button to&#160;“Join”</li><li>History - If you decide to record the meeting, the link to the recording shows up in the chat history as well<br></li></ul></div><div><div>

      <b>Important&#58;</b>&#160;Although the meeting app works great to organize Teamwork such as Scrum meetings or other client meetings, it is not very suitable for more global events such as a retreat or a conference. At SSW we use Microsoft Outlook appointments in those instances.<br></div><div>

   <br></dt><dd>​​Figure&#58; Bad Example - This appointment was created using Outlook using Zoom -&#160;the team members&#160;needed to be added to the appointment&#160;individually and there are too many options on how to join the meeting.<br></dd></dl></div></div><dl class="goodImage"><dt>

   </dt><dd>​​Figure&#58; Good Example - I know this appointment was created in&#160;Microsoft Teams since it was created on behalf of the team (see sender) and at&#160;the bottom&#160;it&#160;has&#160;a link so that people can click and join the correct meeting (even without Teams installed)<br></dd></dl> </span>
