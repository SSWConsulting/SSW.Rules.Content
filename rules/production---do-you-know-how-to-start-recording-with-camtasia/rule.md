<span class='intro'> Follow these steps to start recording using Camtasia&#58;
​<br> </span>

<ol><li>Set your screen resolution to as high as possible but do not exceed 1920 x 1080 for a 16&#58;9 display,&#160;or 1920 x 1200 for a 16&#58;10 display. If your screen resolution is too low then you will either have to expand the footage in post-production (which will result in a loss of quality) or release a low-resolution video (which will become poor quality when watched in full screen).</li><dl class="image"><dt> <img alt="screen resolution.png" src="./screen%20resolution.png" style="width&#58;650px;" /> <br></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Set your screen resolution as high as possible without exceeding 1920 x 1080</dd></dl><dl class="badImage"><dt> <img alt="poor resolution screenshot.jpg" src="./poor%20resolution%20screenshot.jpg" style="width&#58;650px;" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Bad example - screen resolution is set to 800 x 600.</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt> <img alt="good resolution screenshot.jpg" src="./good%20resolution%20screenshot.jpg" style="width&#58;650px;" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good example - screen resolution set to 1920 x 1080</dd></dl><li>Start 'Camtasia Recorder' <dl class="image"><dt> <img alt="How to record with Camtasia - step 1" src="./record-camtasia-1.jpg" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Click on &quot;Record the Screen&quot;</dd></dl></li><li>In the Recorder window, select 'Full Screen', then turn on the mic.
