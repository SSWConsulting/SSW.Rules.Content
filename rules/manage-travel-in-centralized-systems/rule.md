When employees need to travel between offices or various locations, 
they typically require accommodation, flights, transportation, and other necessities. 
Managing these bookings, obtaining approvals, and handling tax invoices can be both costly and time consuming.

Imagine first organising a trip six months in advance, and having to wait that long until you receive the invoices. 
Now multiply this complexity by managing several reservations concurrently. It becomes overwhelming! Orz

In a dynamic business environment, effectively managing travel expenses is key for organizations trying to optimize costs while maintaining efficiecy and compliance. 

Utilizing centralized booking platforms can help greatly in achieving this.  

### Example of centralized travel systems:

* Accommodation – [Trip.com](https://www.trip.com/)
* Flight – [Qantas Business, Virgin Business](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/missing-flight-invoices/)
* Uber – [Uber for Business](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/do-you-make-business-travel-easier/)
  
It is important to establish appropriate access levels and securely share login credentials using tools like Keeper. 
This ensures that administrators and accountants can efficiently manage documentation and expenses.
