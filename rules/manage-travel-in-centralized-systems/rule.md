When employees need to travel between offices or various locations, 
they typically require accommodations, flights, transportation, and other necessities. 
Managing these bookings, obtaining approvals, and handling tax invoices can be both costly and administratively burdensome.

Imagine the scenario of scheduling a trip six months in advance, to deal with tax invoices after the journey. 
Now multiply this complexity by managing numerous reservations concurrently. Orz, it becomes quite overwhelming! 

In a dynamic business environment, effectively managing travel expenses is paramount for organizations striving to optimize costs while maintaining compliance and operational efficiency. 
Utilizing centralized booking platforms can significantly alleviate these challenges.

### Example of centralized travel systems:

* Accommodation – [Trip.com](https://www.trip.com/)
* Flight – [Qantas Business, Virgin Business](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/missing-flight-invoices/)
* Uber – [Uber for Business](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/do-you-make-business-travel-easier/)
  
It is important to establish appropriate access levels and securely share login credentials using tools like Keeper. 
This ensures that administrators and accountants can efficiently manage documentation and expenses.
