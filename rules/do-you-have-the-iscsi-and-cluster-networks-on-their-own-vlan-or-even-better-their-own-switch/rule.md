Having the network flooded with a virus is bad news â€“ but it will be worse news if iSCSI traffic is going across the same network. This is why you should have your iSCSI or SAN traffic on a different VLAN.

Note: An even better and more expensive solution is purchase a separate Switch for each network (this example means 3 network adapters = 3 networks)
