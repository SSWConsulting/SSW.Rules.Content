Renaming pages in SharePoint site will cause broken links. All requests to the old URL will be responded to with a 404 error. 
<!--endintro-->

Options to resolve this issue are:

* Add a page every time for a rename…. add a JavaScript or META tag redirect to the original page
* Use custom 404 page to look at a list in SharePoint, the list contains all the renaming records, the records are automatically maintained via page updating events handler. (We are using this way)
* Wait for MS to fix the problem - [support classical alternative links for a page.](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/BetterSoftwareSuggestions/SharePointTeamServices.aspx#PageAlternativeURLs)
