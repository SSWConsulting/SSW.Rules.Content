<span class='intro'> ​​​​​​​Application Insights can provide an overwhelming amount of errors in your web application, so use just-in-time bug processing to handle them.<br> </span>

<p>The goal is to each morning check your web application's dashboard and find zero errors. However, what happens if there are multiple errors? Don't panic, follow this process to improve your application's health.</p><dl class="image"><dt>

You can find out the user's browser details, what page they tried to access, as well as the stack trace (Tip&#58; make sure you follow the rule on&#160;<a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=68f64a3a-78ec-49f6-87ed-7ee92af1c809">How to set up Application Insights</a>&#160;to enhance the stack trace).</p><dl class="image"><dt>

Simply create one bug for the most critical issue. Reproduce, fix and close&#160;the bug&#160;then you can move onto the next one and repeat. This is just-in-time bug processing and will move your application towards better health one step at a time.</p><dl class="badImage"><dt>
