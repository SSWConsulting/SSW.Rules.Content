<span class='intro'> <p>NuGet allows you to search for, install, upgrade, configure and remove 3rd party libraries from Visual Studio projects in a consistent and easy to use manner.</p> </span>

<p>NuGet makes it easy to manage 3rd party libraries in your projects by keeping track of the library and the files needed to make it work with the concept of a package.</p>
<p>The package contains all the information needed for the 3rd party library to work with your project including any dependencies it may require.</p>
<p>The concept of a package makes it very easy to upgrade and remove the libraries in the future with a single click.</p>
