<span class='intro'> <h3>Schedule a Specification Review<br></h3><p>For almost all projects, there is a need for additional requirements gathering. Some clients don't have any kind of specification, while the specifications you&#160;are given can sometimes be&#160;lacking in detail or incomplete. Accordingly, before you&#160;can provide an estimated&#160;price for completing the project, there is another step that requires the engagement of your&#160;resources - the&#160;<strong>Specification Review</strong>.​<br></p> </span>

<p></p><p>It is the responsibility of the Account Manager during the initial meeting to present the benefits of a Specification Review for the client. Following the initial meeting, the Account Manager will send a​&#160;<a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=8dc33f53-e08f-44d7-9304-ca7b3fe89296" target="_blank">brief proposal</a>&#160;in the form of a&#160;<a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/templates/BriefProposalPostInitialMeeting.docx">Post initial meeting</a>&#160;email through to the prospective client for a Specification Review.&#160;</p><p><strong>Note&#58;&#160;</strong>Make sure everyone who was in the meeting from your company checks the email&#160;before it's sent.</p><p>It may be necessary to conduct a second initial meeting with a technical specialist attending as well.&#160;<br></p><p>You may also find that some clients are unable to progress to a Spec Review until they have a vague ballpark. In these cases, the salesperson is to make the decision whether an extra 4 hours will be spent investigating the solution before the ballpark is given. This should then be sent as part of that &quot;Post initial meeting&quot; email mentioned above, with Spec review info swapped out for ballpark estimate info as required.</p><p>A salesperson has 16 hours per month of developer time they can invest in this pre-sales investigation, so this time has to be used wisely.<br></p><dl class="image"><dt><img src="adam-cogan-ceo-in-a-business-meeting.jpg" alt="adam-cogan-ceo-in-a-business-meeting.jpg" style="width&#58;750px;margin&#58;5px;" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Pre-sale meeting - use time wisely<br></dd></dl><p>​Never offer a fixed price at the conclusion of an Initial Meeting, and this engagement model must be chosen before&#160;the Specification Review is done.</p><p>More on the&#160;<a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=35fd7784-942a-43ec-8a4b-6edf2fc601ba">Specification Review rules</a>.<br></p><dl class="image"><dt><img alt="Send a brief proposal" src="Brief-Proposal-MrNorthwind.jpg" style="width&#58;750px;margin&#58;5px;" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; Send a&#160;<a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/templates/BriefProposal.docx">brief proposal</a></dd></dl><h3>Ad-Hoc work/Consulting</h3><p>In case the work is thought to be less than 3 developer days and the scope is well understood, it may be worthwhile for the developers to commence work straight away without a Specification Review. Normal standards for work should be followed, such as&#160;<a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=731a3f5d-a266-4944-876c-a45afa82832f">daily scrums</a>. This type of work is called 'ad-hoc' work.</p><p>You&#160;may also immediately commence ad-hoc work if the client is a technical client and you&#160;are providing resources for an existing project under the sole direction of the client.&#160;<br></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Related Rule​<br></h3><ul><li><a>Do you incentivize a quick Spec Review sale?​​​</a>​<br></li></ul>
