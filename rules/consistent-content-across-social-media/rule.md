**Being consistent on your content across the different platforms you use is key to having a consistent online brand presence.** It will help you grow audience engagement across the social media platforms you use for your business by following your branding guidelines and the personality you defined for your company.

<!--endintro-->

**The content of your social media posts should be consistent across your different accounts, which means having the same caption (text), URLs, videos, images, and hashtags on each one.** If your post exceeds the character limit of a site such as Twitter, you can write a separate, shorter version of the post to use instead.

**Be aware that if you decide to update or edit the content later, you might not be allowed to do so.** No social media platform allows you to change the original image or video after it's published, and some sites have additional editing limitations. For example, on Twitter you cannot update anything; you would have to delete the tweet and start again. On LinkedIn, you cannot edit a video thumbnail (whereas you can on Facebook).

Across all platforms, you will find that they have some limitations and recommendations regarding character limits. See them in [this blog post from HootSuite](https://blog.hootsuite.com/ideal-social-media-post-length/).

Also, Sprout Social has an interesting [social media character counter](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-character-counter/) that you can test your content before putting your post out.

Some tips:

* Hashtags are really popular on Instagram and Twitter, but not as much on Facebook.\
  **Note:** This does not apply to social media ads. If you run campaigns with repetitive ad copy, you will fail in every single campaign. To be able to prove that you have good ad copywriting on a certain campaign, you will need a variety of text to see which ad is performing better and driving more conversions.
* LinkedIn is a professional platform, so it is good sense to avoid using too many emojis or sharing memes if it's not the right fit for your industry.
