<span class='intro'> DevOps and Scrum compliment each other very well. Scrum is about&#160;inspecting​ and adapting with the help of the Scrum ceremonies (Standup, Review, Planning and Retro). With DevOps it's all about Building, Measuring and Improving with the help of tools and automation.<div><br></div><div><img src="/SiteAssets/do-you-know-how-devops-fits-in-with-scrum/2016-06-08_14-33-24.png" alt="2016-06-08_14-33-24.png" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;808px;" /><br><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; Traditional Scrum Process<br></dd><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P"><img src="/SiteAssets/do-you-know-how-devops-fits-in-with-scrum/2016-06-08_14-30-33.png" alt="2016-06-08_14-30-33.png" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;808px;" />​​​​<br></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Figure&#58; Scrum with DevOps​​</dd><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​​​With DevOps, we add tools to help us automate slow process like build and deployment then add metrics to give us numbers to help quantify our processes. Then we gather the metrics and figure out what can be done to improve.<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P"><br></p><br><p></p></div> </span>

<p>​</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">For example with Exception Handling, you may be using a tool like Raygun.io or Elmah and have 100s of errors logged in them. So what do you do with these errors? You can&#58;</p><ol><li><span style="line-height&#58;20px;">Add each one to your backlog</span><br></li><li><span style="line-height&#58;20px;">Add a task to each sprint to &quot;Get exceptions to 0&quot;</span><span style="line-height&#58;20px;">​​​</span></li></ol><p></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">The problem with the above is that not all exceptions are equal, and&#160;most of the time they are not more important than the planned PBIs being worked on. No developers like working a whole sprint just looking at exceptions.&#160;What should happen is&#58;</p><ol><li><span style="line-height&#58;20px;">Have the&#160;exceptions visible in your development process</span><span style="line-height&#58;20px;">&#160;(i.e. using Slack, adding as something to check before Sprint Planning)</span><br></li><li><span style="line-height&#58;20px;">Triage the exceptions</span><span style="line-height&#58;20px;">, either add them to the backlog if they are urgent and important</span><br></li><li><span style="line-height&#58;20px;">Add ignore&#160;filters to the exception logging tool to ignore errors you don't care about (e.g. 404s)</span><br></li><li><span style="line-height&#58;20px;">Prioritize the exceptions on the backlog</span></li></ol><p><span style="line-height&#58;20px;">​The goal here is to make sure you're not missing important and to reduce the noise. You want these tools to help support your efforts and make your more productive&#160;and not just be another time sink.</span></p>
