The role of the [<font color="#000080">PBI Owner</font>](/Pages/OwnerForEveryUserStory.aspx) is like a mini project manager. The PBI Owner resolves any road blocks, performs the “[<font color="#000080">Test Please</font>](/Pages/TestPleaseInScrum.aspx)” and makes sure there is a good presentation at the Review Meeting. In addition having a PBI Owner makes it easy for Product Owners and others to talk to the right person.   
<!--endintro-->

There are five things that the story owner is responsible for:

* Manage / Own the story and its sub tasks
* Make sure a “[<font color="#000080">Test Please</font>](/Pages/TestPleaseInScrum.aspx)” is conducted (or that their story is included in one)
* Make every effort to show the story to the Product Owner before the Sprint Review (aka a [corridor conversation](/spec-do-you-conduct-a-specification-review-ask-for-a-coffee-not-a-marriage))
* Prepare for the Sprint Review. Make sure he ready for the review. Have a scribe, have a demo plan/script and get the story accepted quickly.
* Present the completed Story at the Sprint Review


Note: Make sure you are ready for the review. Have a scribe and how you are demoing worked out before hand.

The objective of the Review meeting is to have the story accepted quickly.
