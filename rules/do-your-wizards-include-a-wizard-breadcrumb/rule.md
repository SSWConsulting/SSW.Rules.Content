<span class='intro'> <p>Headings that direct the user around your web page are 
     important as it gives the user the feeling of confident in 
     using your web page. The user will tend to feel lost and 
     unsure in what he/she should be doing next, if a website 
     dose not directs them properly. Good navigation through 
     directing headings removes this feeling and gives the user 
     confidence. This rule becomes especially important when it comes to shopping applications, of which Amazon is exemplary. A great shopping application includes the following breadcrumbs&#58;<br><ul><li>Showing the user where they are up to in buying products, previous steps and the next step in the process, gives the user the confidence that they are doing the right steps in purchasing a product.</li><li>Allowing the user to go back to previous steps allows them to change or review a previous choice.</li><li>​Showing the user where they are up to and what is next shows the user what is left in the process in purchasing a product.&#160;<br></li></ul></p> </span>
