Whenever we rename a file in Visual Studio .NET, the file becomes a new file in SourceSafe. If the file has been checked-out, the status of old file will remain as checked-out in SourceSafe.

The step by step to rename a file that under SourceSafe control:

<!--endintro-->

1. Save and close the file in Visual Studio .NET, and check in the file if it is checked-out.
2. Open Visual SourceSafe Explorer and rename the file.
3. Rename it in Visual Studio .NET, click "Continue with change" to the 2 pop-up messages:
        
![Figure: Warning message of renaming files under source control.](RenameVSS1_small.jpg)  

        
            
![Figure: You are seeing this as the new file name already exists in SourceSafe, just click "Continue with change".](RenameVSS2_small.jpg)  

        
    



 Visual Studio .NET should find the file under source control and it will come up with a lock icon
