Any website designer that needs to display code should be aware that there is a very simple method for simply formatting code, and there is a slow and complex method.

The complex method requires formatting each line with HTML tags (such as &lt;br&gt; and &nbsp;) to ensure the code looks nice and pretty.

The simpler method uses &lt;pre&gt; tags. Pre (standing for "preformatted") means that the code is formatted exactly as it is written in the HTML window. This means the page designer can format code in a very simple fashion, without worrying about tags.

**Note:**  &lt;code&gt; tags should not be used because they only provide the font Courier - you still have to manually indent all of your code as in the bad code display example below.



```
<font face="Courier, Times, Arial, Verdana" size="3">
public class Configuration

&nbsp;{

&nbsp;&nbsp;public static string MySetting

&nbsp;&nbsp;{

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;get

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{

</font>
```

**Tip:**  Do not use auto-format (Ctrl-K, Ctrl-F) in Visual Studio when updating page with &lt;pre&gt; tags, or it will destroy all the code formatting. We have made a suggestion to Microsoft to fix this.
