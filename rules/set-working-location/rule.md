Working from home is common these days, so it is beneficial to let your colleagues know when you're in the office and when you're working remotely.

This can be done through Outlook or Teams, and it will appear on your Calendar in both apps - as well as in [Microsoft Places](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/microsoft-places).
