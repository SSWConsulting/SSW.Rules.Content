Testing can be carried out on the copy, image, demographics and interest groups – altering these variables will give you a range of different results.</p><p>Reporting is vital to determining the success of any campaign, as it allows us to clearly see and compare each campaign and decide which should be altered as they are ineffective and which are performing well.</p><p>Facebook allows you to customize your reports, allowing you to measure the success of your campaign based on your goal.
