This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field).
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <p>Provided that it doesn't have any negative effects on the current release, there will not be any reason why you can't stick to the &quot;customer is always right&quot; philosophy. So what will you do when this happens?</p>
<ol>
    <li>Move any left over work/items to the next release. </li>
    <li>Send a debrief to the client with a note eg. As per your request we have just cancelled Release five and will start on Release six. The remaining items have been moved into Release seven. </li>
    <li>Send a Release Plan for the new release. </li>
</ol>
