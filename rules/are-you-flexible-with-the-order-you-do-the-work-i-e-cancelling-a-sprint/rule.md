Every now and then your clients are going to want to move on to another release which they see is more important than the current one.&#160;Provided that it doesn't have any negative effects on the current release, there isn't any reason why you can't stick to the &quot;customer is always right&quot; philosophy.<br>
<br>
So what will you do when this happens? 
​
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <br>
<ol>
    <li>Move any left over work/items to the next release. </li>
    <li>Send a debrief to the client with a note eg. As per your request we have just cancelled Release five and will start on Release six. The remaining items have been moved into Release seven. </li>
    <li>Send a Release Plan for the new release. </li>
</ol>
