Every now and then your clients are going to want to change their priorites and have you work on something which they see as more important than your current sprint.&#160;Provided that it doesn't have any negative effects overall, there isn't any reason why you can't stick to the &quot;customer is always right&quot; philosophy.<br><br>So what will you do when this happens? ​
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<br><ol><li>Move any left over work/items to the next backlog. </li>
<li>Send a debrief to the client with a note e.g. As per your request we have just cancelled Sprint five and will start on Sprint six. The remaining items have been moved into the backlog. </li>
<li>Send a Sprint&#160;Forecast for the new sprint. </li></ol>
