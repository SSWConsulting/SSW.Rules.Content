There are five interrelated issues that undermine the performance of a team:

<!--endintro-->

1. **Absence of trust** - If the members of the team do not trust each other then they cannot be totally honest with each other.
2. **Fear of conflict** - Without trust people will not have the healthy debates that are necessary to arrive at better thought through decisions.
3. **Lack of commitment** - If the team have not aligned behind a decision then the individual members who did not agree with the final decision will ultimately be less committed to that decision.
4. **Avoidance of accountability** - If they are not committed to the course of action, then they are less likely to feel accountable (or hold other people accountable).
5. **Inattention to results** - Consequently, they are less likely to care about the group results (and instead focus on achieving their own goals).

These are from the excellent book, [The Five Dysfunctions of a Team](https://www.amazon.com/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Fable/dp/0787960756) by Patrick Lencioni.
