If you want to know your website is working or not, you need to add a ping check to the machine also an HTTP Content Scan to the website in WhatsUp. We use WhatsUp to do real-time monitoring.
Follow these steps to check your website in WhatsUp:

<!--endintro-->

1. Add your website as a new device.

3. Add an HTTP Content Scan monitor.

4. Edit the scan script. In the script, you can see 2 keywords "Send" and "Expect".
   "Send" expression is an HTTP request to your website.
   "Expect" expression is a regular expression to check the key word in response from your website.

    Once a device is down or up, a WhatsUp action will tell SQL Reporting Services to send out a notification report.
   Our report looks like this:
