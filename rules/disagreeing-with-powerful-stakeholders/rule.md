## Scenario - Disagreement with the Product Owner about PBI priority

Imagine you are a Developer on a team and you disagree with the Product Owner about the priority of migrating from .NET 6 to .NET 8.

The Product Owner is saying they don't want to do it but you think it's important to do it this Sprint.

Let's see what tips and tricks can be applied to ensure a smooth discussion.

<!--endintro-->

## Align your interests and understanding

When you have a disagreement with a stakeholder, it's likely that you have different perspectives and understanding. Before you talk about the issue, it's pivotal to check you are on the same page about the issue and looking for a path forward. Here are some tips for doing so:

1. Repeat your understanding of the issue
1. Ask permission
1. Find a common target

#### 1. Repeat your understanding of the issue

By repeating back your understanding of the issue, you can check that their viewpoint aligns with yours, and if there are any discrepancies, they can be caught before the issue is discussed.

**Developer**: I think you don't want to migrate from .NET 6 to .NET 8 because you want to finish adding single-sign on first

**Product Owner**: Actually, the reason is because .NET 9 comes out in a few months and I want to wait for that version.
:::
:::good
Good example - The Developer identified that the Product Owner had a different reason than they thought
:::

#### 2. Ask permission

Getting permission to talk is a great tactic. It makes the stakeholder feel empowered to have the conversation and also gives you confidence that they are interested in what you have to say.

:::greybox
**Developer**: Would it be okay if I explain why I think we should upgrade now?

**Product Owner**: Sure!
:::
:::good
Good example - The Developer makes the Product Owner feel empowered and also builds their own confidence
:::

#### 3. Find a common target

Determine an outcome you both want to see from the solution. That way the conversation centers on delivering business value rather than being contrary for the sake of it.

:::greybox
**Developer**: Lately, our users have been having significant performance issues, and that has been a pain point. Would you agree?

**Product Owner**: Yes, absolutely!

**Developer**: Well, when I read the .NET 8 release notes I saw they have fixed a bug which will resolve this performance issue for our users. That's why I want to upgrade now.
:::
:::good
Good example - The **Developer** identified a pain point the **Product Owner** cares about which will strengthen their position and open the way for more discussion

## Keep the dialogue focused on the issue

When talking with a powerful stakeholder it's vital to keep the conversation on track and focused on the issue itself. Here are several strategies you can use:

1. Ground yourself in logic
1. Express that it's your opinion
1. Avoid judgemental language
1. Leave it up to them

#### 1. Ground yourself in logic

When communicating about a problem, emotions can quickly get in the way. You want to project confidence and neutrality - that's why it's critical to try and stick to the logic and facts.

#### 2. Express that it's your opinion

If you caveat that you are just expressing your opinion, others will feel like you are open to discussing the issue rationally and that you understand others may disagree.

:::greybox
**Product Owner**: I don't want to upgrade to .NET 8 this Sprint because I want to wait for .NET 9

**Developer**: No, we should upgrade to .NET 8 this Sprint because it will help fix users' performance issues.
:::
:::bad
Bad example - The **Developer** didn't express that it was their opinion.
:::

:::greybox
**Developer**: In my opinion, it's better if we upgrade to .NET 8 this Sprint because it will help fix users' performance issues.
:::
:::good
Good example - The **Developer** mentions that it is their opinion leaving the topic open for discussion.
:::

#### 3. Avoid judgemental language

Language that sounds accusatory or judgmental can evoke bad reactions and derail a conversation. Words like "stupid", "hasty", "naive" etc. focus the discussion on people's judgment rather than the issue itself. When that happens, you are no longer discussing the logical cause of the disagreement.

:::greybox
**Developer**: It would be stupid if we didn't upgrade to .NET 8 this Sprint
:::
:::bad
Bad example - The **Developer** made their point sound like a personal attack on the stakeholder's judgment
:::

:::greybox
**Developer**: If we don't upgrade to .NET 8 this Sprint, our users are going to keep having the performance issues they have been complaining about.
:::
:::good
Good example - The **Developer** identifies a pain point for the users, rather than making it emotion based
:::

#### 4. Leave it up to them

Let them know it's their decision, but be clear that you disagree. Communicating this way allows them to feel in control but also makes it obvious what your opinion is.

:::greybox
We should upgrade to .NET 8 this Sprint so that we can solve the performance problems users are experiencing.
:::
:::bad
Bad example - Doesn't leave the power in the stakeholders hands.
:::

:::greybox
My opinion is that we should upgrade to .NET 8 this Sprint so that we can solve the performance problems users are experiencing. However, it's your call to make so I'll leave it up to you.
:::
:::good
Good example - Clearly expresses that the final decision is up to them but that you think the upgrade should be done this Sprint.
