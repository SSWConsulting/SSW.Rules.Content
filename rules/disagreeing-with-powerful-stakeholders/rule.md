## Scenario - Disagreement with the Product Owner about PBI priority

Imagine you are a developer on a team and you disagree with the Product Owner about the priority of migrating from .NET 6 to .NET 8.

The Product Owner is saying they don't want to do it but you think it's important to do it this Sprint.

Let's see what tips and tricks can be applied to ensure a smooth discussion ensues.

## Align your interests and understanding
When you have a disagreement with a stakeholder, it's likely that you have different perspectives and understanding. Before you talk about the issue, it's pivotal to check you are on the same page about the issue and looking for a path forward. Here are some tips for doing so:

* Repeat your understanding of the issue
* Ask permission
* Find a common target

### Repeat your understanding of the issue
Sometimes you might interpret an issue differently than the stakeholder. By repeating back your understanding of the issue, you can check that their viewpoint aligns with yours, and if there are any discrepancies, they can be caught before the issue is discussed.

Developer: I think you don't want to migrate from .NET 6 to .NET 8 because you want to finish adding single-sign on first

Product Owner: Actually, the reason is because .NET 9 comes out in a few months and I want to wait for that version.

Good example - The Developer restating their understanding identified that the Product Owner had a different reason than they thought
:::

### Ask permission
Getting permission to talk is a great tactic. It makes the stakeholder feel empowered to have the conversation and also gives you confidence that they are interested in what you have to say.

:::greybox
Developer: Would it be okay if I explain why I think we should upgrade now?

Product Owner: Sure!
:::
:::good
Good example - The Developer makes the Product Owner feel empowered and also builds their own confidence
:::

### Find a common target
Determine an outcome you both want to see from the solution and articulate that. That way the conversation centers on delivering business value rather than on being contrary for the sake of it.

:::greybox
Developer: Lately, our users have been having significant performance issues, and that has been a pain point. Would you agree?

Product Owner: Yes, absolutely!

Developer: Well, when I read the .NET 8 release notes I saw they have fixed a bug which will resolve this performance issue for our users. That's why I want to upgrade now.

:::good
Good example - The Developer identified a pain point the Product Owner cares about which will strengthen their position and open the way for more discussion

## Keep the dialogue focused on discussing the issue
When talking with a powerful stakeholder it's vital to keep the conversation on track and focused on the issue itself. Here are several strategies you can use:

* Ground yourself in logic
* Express that it's your opinion - 
* Avoid Adjectives
* Leave it up to them

### Ground yourself in logic
When communicating emotions can quickly get in the way, you want to project confidence and neutrality. That's why it's critical to try and stick to the logic and facts in a discussion.

### Express that it's your opinion
If you caveat that you are just expressing your opinion, others will feel like you are open to discussing the issue rationally and that you understand others may disagree.

:::greybox
Product Owner: I don't want to upgrade to .NET 8 this Sprint because I want to wait for .NET 9

Developer: No, we should upgrade to .NET 8 this Sprint because it will help fix users' performance issues.
:::
:::bad
Bad example - The Developer didn't express that it was their opinion.
:::

:::greybox
Developer: In my opinion, it's better if we upgrade to .NET 8 this Sprint because it will help fix users' performance issues.
:::
:::good
Good example - The Developer mentions that it is their opinion leaving the topic open for discussion.
:::

### Avoid judgmental language
Language that sounds accusatory or judgmental can evoke bad reactions in others and derail a conversation. Words like "stupid", "hasty", "naive' etc focus the discussion on people's judgment rather than the issue itself. This focus will mean you aren't discussing the logical cause of the disagreement.

:::greybox
Developer: It would be stupid if we didn't upgrade to .NET 8 this Sprint
:::
:::bad
Bad example - The Developer made their point sound like a personal attack on the stakeholder's judgment
:::

:::greybox
Developer: If we don't upgrade to .NET 8 this Sprint, our users are going to keep having the performance issues they have been complaining about.
:::
:::good
Good example - The Developer identifies a pain point for the users, rather than making it emotion based
:::

### Leave it up to them
Let them know it's their decision, but be clear that you disagree. Communicating this way allows them to feel in control but also makes it obvious what your opinion is.

:::greybox
My opinion is that we should upgrade to .NET 8 this Sprint so that we can solve the performance problems users are experiencing. However, it's your call to make so I'll leave it up to you.
:::
:::good
Good example - Clearly expresses that the final decision is up to them but that you think the upgrade should be done this Sprint.
