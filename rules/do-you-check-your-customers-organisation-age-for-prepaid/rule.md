It is essential to be familiar with your organization's Terms & Conditions, as it may impact the way you invoice. [SSW Terms & Conditions](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Forms/ConsultingOrderTermsConditions.aspx) allow SSW to invoice on a Prepaid basis as per part '6 - Pre-Paid Work' & '19 - Payment Terms'. 


It is also highly recommended to invoice customers, who have been in existence for less than 2 years on a prepaid basis. It may, however, be an awkward conversation or irrelevant on the customer's behalf to ask of their organization's age in an initial meeting.  Instead, you can perform an [ASIC Company Search](https://connectonline.asic.gov.au/RegistrySearch) to determine the customer's organization age.

To do so, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to ASIC Company search page above and change the filters to 'Organisation & Business Names'. Enter the customer's name or ABN number

3. Review the registration date or alternatively, purchase a $9 company extract which provides the same details on the free page with some additional information (however irrelevant for prepaid purposes)

4. Should the registration date be less than 2 years old, ensure that the message is pushed across to the state managers so they can push towards invoicing on a prepaid basis wherever possible.
