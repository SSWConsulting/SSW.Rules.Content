Team Foundation Server is the fully integrated solution to manage projects, giving developers, testers and management a single source of truth for all project needs.

<!--endintro-->

#### Project Managers and stakeholders will love:

* TFS's integration with code/SQL/SharePoint which provides a dashboard with project reports, giving them greater visibility of the project status and burn down lists
* The easily customization of the data using Excel Web Services


#### Developers will love:

* TFS 2010 for the SQL and SharePoint Server Explorer and the integration of viewing, creating and deploying
* That they don't have to try to interpret a bug report from a tester,  and then they have to reproduce it. Why? Because of Intellitrace, which allows you to double click and open to the exact line of code with the variables set.
* Seamless source control
* No waiting for compiling and tests to run. The integration with the build server (continuous integration) is the biggest productivity boost you can give a developer
* SharePoint Wiki


#### Testers will love:

* The many ways of automating their manual tests via:
    * Web tests
    * Performance tests
    * And the jewel in the crown, Coded UI Tests
* The fact they never have to spend time reproducing a bug before documenting it
* And it gets better, they don't have to document it because testing tools recorded what they did
* Later on, when they decide to go with Lab Manager they will never spend time setting up that special environment (say running windows 95 and IE6)
