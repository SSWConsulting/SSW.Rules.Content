Instagram is one of the most popular social networks today. It's very important that the images you share look great for every user, so always follow the minimum&#160;standard image resolution when making a new post. So, what should be your​ image size for Instagram?<br><br>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>​Since 2015, Instagram's default&#160;image size&#160;is&#160;<strong>1080px by 1080px</strong>&#160;to keep up with Retina and other high-resolution displays available on smartphones, tablets, and&#160;laptops. <br></p>
