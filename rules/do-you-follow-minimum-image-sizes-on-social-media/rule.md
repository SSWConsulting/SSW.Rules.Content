<p>​Always make sure the images you add to any&#160;post has good quality. Read and follow​ 
   <a href="https&#58;//www.brandwatch.com/blog/social-media-image-sizes-guide/">The Latest Social Media Image Sizes&#160;Guide</a>.<br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>It's very important that the images you share look great for every user, so always follow the minimum&#160;standard image resolution when making a new post. For example, what should be your​ image size for Instagram?</p><p>Since 2015, Instagram's default&#160;image size&#160;is&#160;<strong>1080px by 1080px</strong>&#160;to keep up with Retina and other high-resolution displays available on smartphones, tablets, and&#160;laptops.​<br></p><p>By the way, if you're shooting straight from your smartphone camera don't bother, the image should be already good enough ;)<br></p>
