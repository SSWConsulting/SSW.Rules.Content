Each Sprint has a "Sprint Forecast" email that details what will be worked on during this Sprint.

At the end of the Sprint, this should be replied to with a "Sprint Review" email that shows a breakdown of what was completed.

If you're using GitHub to manage your project, create repeatable templates that can easily edited and emailed out.  
See [GitHub Issues - Do you create a template for your Sprint Reviews, Retros and Forecasts?](/github-sprint-templates) for more details.

Each Sprint has the following stages:

<!--endintro-->

1. **Planning meeting**

   - Sprint Forecast email: "Northwind - Sprint 5 Forecast"
   - See [Do you send "Sprint Forecast" email to the client?](/do-you-create-a-sprint-forecast-aka-the-functionality-that-will-be-developed-during-the-sprint) for more details

2. **Work in progress**

   - "Done" emails are sent asking for specific functionality to be tested
   - See [Rules to better Email](/rules-to-better-email) for details

3. **Review and Retro meetings**

   - The [Sprint review/retro email](/sprint-review-retro-email): "Northwind - Sprint 5 Review/Retro"
