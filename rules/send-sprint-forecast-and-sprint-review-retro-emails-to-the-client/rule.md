<div>Each sprint has a &quot;Sprint&#160;plan&quot; email that details what will be worked on during this sprint. At the end of the sprint, this should be replied to with a breakdown of what was completed.</div>
<p>Each sprint has the following stages&#58;</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol><li>Planning meeting<br>* The Sprint plan email&#58; &quot;Northwind Sprint 5 Plan&quot;</li>
<li>Review and Retro meetings<br>​​* The Sprint review/retro email&#58; &quot;Northwind Sprint 5 Review/Retro&quot;<br>* Include the Sprint Plan in the history<br>* Include significant notes from the Retro<br>* Any other notes that the stakeholder might need to know</li></ol>
<p>The goal of this email is to inform disconnected stakeholders (depending on what notes you include) info that will answer the following questions&#58;</p>
<ul><li>The location of the new package you built last Friday </li>
<li>The % of the tasks done? (Find this from your current iteration) </li>
<li>The % of the budget spent? (Find from your Billing System. <a href="/Management/RulesToManagingSoftwareConsultants/Pages/DoYouGetRegularUpdatesOnCostsAndProgress.aspx">See example of a Billing Report - Project Progress Report</a>) </li>
<li>Expected finish date </li></ul>
