Each sprint has a "Sprint Forecast" email that details what will be worked on during this sprint.

At the end of the sprint, this should be replied to with a "Sprint Review" email that shows a breakdown of what was completed.

Each sprint has the following stages:

1. Planning meeting:
    * Sprint Forecast email: "Northwind Sprint 5 Forecast"
    * See [Do you send a Sprint Forecast Email](/do-you-create-a-sprint-forecast-%28aka-the-functionality-that-will-be-developed-during-the-sprint%29) for more details
2. The work is done:
