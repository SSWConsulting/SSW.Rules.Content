Each sprint has a "Sprint Forecast" email that details what will be worked on during this sprint.

At the end of the sprint, this should be replied to with a "Sprint Review" email that shows a breakdown of what was completed.

Each Sprint has the following stages:

1. **Planning meeting**

   * Sprint Forecast email: "Northwind - Sprint 5 Forecast"
   * See [Do you send "Sprint Forecast" email to the client?](/do-you-create-a-sprint-forecast-aka-the-functionality-that-will-be-developed-during-the-sprint) for more details

2. **Work in progress**

   * "Done" emails are sent asking for specific functionality to be tested
   * See [Rules to better Email](/rules-to-better-email) for details

3. **Review and Retro meetings**

   * The [Sprint review/retro email](/do-you-create-a-sprint-review-retro-email): "Northwind - Sprint 5 Review/Retro"
