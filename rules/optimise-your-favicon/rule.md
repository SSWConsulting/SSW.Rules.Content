Favicons are commonplace in web development, but did you know your favicon may not be properly optimised for all devices?

## What is a Favicon?

Favicons are most commonly used to display a custom icon on a browser tab, but they can also be used to alter the display of your website in other cases.

Some places the favicon is used are:
- Browser Tabs
- Android and iPhone Icons
- Windows and Mac Icons

## How to Check Your Favicon

Even if your website has a favicon, it may not be fully compliant.
