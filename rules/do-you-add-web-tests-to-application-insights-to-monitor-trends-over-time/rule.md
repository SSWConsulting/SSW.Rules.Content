<span class='intro'> <p>​As soon as you have configured Application Insights, you should immediately add a Web Test to track general performance trends&#160;​​over time. You can configure test agents to access your application from different locations around the globe to give a general idea of&#160;what users will experience.​&#160;<br>Instructions on how to configure can be found on MSDN&#160;<a href="https&#58;//azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-insights-monitor-web-app-availability/">https&#58;//azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-insights-monitor-web-app-availability/​​</a></p> </span>
