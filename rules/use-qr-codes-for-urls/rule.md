Have you ever watched an awesome presentation, and been excited to hear the presenter say they are going to share some resources, only to be frustrated when they're racing through their slides too fast for you to note down the URLs they are sharing? It's best not to do that to your audience.

<!--endintro-->

Showing URLs on a slide is sometimes necessary - for example, you might be specifically talking about URLs. But when it comes to sharing resources, your audience will struggle to note them down, and lingering on the slide just so people can take note of it can interrupt your flow.

A much better approach is to use QR codes in your slides instead. Your audience can quickly scan the code and bookmark the interesting resource you are sharing.
