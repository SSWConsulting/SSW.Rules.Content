<div>Some people like popup forms. Some do not.</div>
<div>Popup modal forms are no good&#58;</div>
<ul><li>as you can't read or edit something else in a window behind</li>
<li>as they take a lot of time to load in a browser (ask any CRM 4 user)</li></ul>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
​<div>Popup forms are good&#58;</div>
<ul><li>as it is obvious you have an action step to perform before continuing</li>
<li>as they simplify a form that has lots of fields </li>
<li>if they can't get lost behind another window</li>
<li>if you make them clear by dimming the background (see below)</li></ul>

<dd>Figure&#58; Bad example - if this was a popup form it would be easier to focus on where to look (as a minimum you would be looking at half the screen)</dd></dl>

<dd>Figure&#58; Good example - the popup with the dimmed background is much more intuitive</dd></dl>
<div>For example, adding a webpart in SharePoint 2010 should use a popup form. <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/BetterSoftwareSuggestions/sharepoint2010.aspx#PopupForm">See our suggestion to Microsoft</a>.</div>
