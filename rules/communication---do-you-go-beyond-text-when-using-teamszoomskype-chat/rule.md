<p>​Communication can be difficult &#160;(even if English is your first language!).&#160;It might be tempting to only communicate via IM, but this will not improve your skills or build a relationship as well as communicating verbally.<br></p><ol><li>Stop&#58; Just using IM</li><li>Start&#58; Asking ‘Can I call you?’&#160;<br>...<br></li><li>Start&#58; Using video call (if weak bandwidth just use it for the first 10 seconds)</li><li>Start&#58; Make up for weak English by typing while speaking <br></li></ol><dl class="image"><dt> <img src="/PublishingImages/skype-conference.jpg" alt="skype-conference.jpg" /> <br>

Sound - Check the sound quality of the microphone - you need a good mic and it should be close to your mouth - if you are using the laptop mic, sit in close.<br>4. Video - Check the image quality of the camera. Beware of the angle of the camera - the ones with thin bezels now put the camera at the base, looking up your nose. Avoid them.<br>5. <a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=21a35c4d-e815-42a2-b69c-14206aa7e968">Consider what is in the background​​</a><br>6.
