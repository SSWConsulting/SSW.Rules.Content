<p>Communication can be difficult &#160;(even if English is your first language!).&#160;It might be tempting to only communicate via IM, but this will not improve your skills or build a relationship as well as communicating verbally.​​<br></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad">Stop&#58; Just using&#160;text in IM<br></dd><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Start&#58; Asking ‘Can I call you?’ (Especially for complicated conversations)<br></dd><dl class="image"><dt> <img src="/PublishingImages/skype-conference.jpg" alt="skype-conference.jpg" /> <br>

<ul><li>Try to always answe<span style="color&#58;#444444;">r the call with video&#160;(if weak bandwidth,&#160;use it for the first 10 seconds and say &quot;I'll turn off video to save bandwidth&quot;).</span><br></li><li> 
      <b>Sound</b> - Be ready with the headset already on (it looks disorganized plugging it in after you make the call)<br></li><li> 
      <b>Sound</b> - Check the sound quality of the microphone - you need a good mic and it should be close to your mouth - if you are using the laptop mic, sit in close.<br></li><li> 
      <b>Video</b> - Check the image quality of the camera. Beware of the angle of the camera - the ones with thin bezels now put the camera at the base, looking up your nose. Avoid them.&#160;Frame your head and shoulders in the shot, and keep the camera lens at or above eye level​ -&#160;use a cardboard box as a stand if necessary.<br>Eye to Eye level is best - for&#160;more info see&#160;<a href="https&#58;//www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/04/11/zoom-meetings-go-better-these-6-tips-look-your-best/5125980002/">Six tips for looking great in a Zoom meeting​</a>​<br></li><li> 
      <b>Video</b> -&#160;Consider what is in the background -&#160;Keep a light source on your face, and try to avoid sitting with a window behind you.<br>​​Get your video background right. Check

      <b>Video</b> - Have a microfiber cloth and wipe off the lens from time to time.<br></li><li>
      <b>Text</b> -&#160;It's always helpful to confirm things you're talking about with typed text during the call (Especially helpful for people with English as a second language).<br></li></ul><p>
   <strong>Tip&#58;</strong> Help the other person with&#160;following&#160;this rule&#160;by taking a screenshot and giving them a mark /10 with good and bad feedback on the call quality&#160;and background.</p><dl class="badImage"><dt>
