Distinguishing visited links is very helpful to show where       users have been before. Visited links should still stand out       but not as obvious as unvisited ones. Give visited links a       less saturated colour to give that "used" look and be careful       not to overuse css techniques on visited links.

Specifying style for visited links is very simple. Just add this to your CSS file:



```
A:visited { color: purple; }
```
