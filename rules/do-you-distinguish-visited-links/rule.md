<span class='intro'> <p>Distinguishing visited links is very helpful to show where 
     users have been before. Visited links should still stand out 
     but not as obvious as unvisited ones. Give visited links a 
     less saturated colour to give that &quot;used&quot; look and be careful 
     not to overuse css techniques on visited links.
                </p> </span>
