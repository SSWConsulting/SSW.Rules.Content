[Do you do a Daily Scrum?](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=731a3f5d-a266-4944-876c-a45afa82832f) Daily Scrums are important because:

* They keep us in sync + show what we are working on
* They increase visibility, especially towards blockers
* Are an opportunity to adjust priorities if something urgent comes up

If you don't do Daily Scrums, have a catch up with your clients and/or team anyway. People need to be across what you’re working on to improve visibility and grow trust.
