[Daily Scrums](/methodology-daily-scrums) are important because:

<!--endintro-->

* They keep us in sync + show what we are working on
* They increase visibility, especially towards blockers
* Are an opportunity to adjust priorities if something urgent comes up

If you can't do a proper Daily Scrum, have a catch up with your clients and/or team anyways. People need to be across what you’re working on to improve visibility and grow trust.
