<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">​When it comes to the easiest and quickest
way to share files between designers, it should all be done in Dropbox.</span></p>

      <strong>OneDrive (was SkyDrive) requires me to check out the file in SharePoint before I make changes. </strong>
      <p>I have to open a web browser, log in to the intranet, check out the file, and then open the file on my computer before I can make edits to it. This is a shocking amount of busy work for something that is already on my computer. I am unable to work directly from the file on my computer and have it sync automatically. I have to check out a file that is ON my computer. Why can I not check out the file from my computer? Why does it not check out the file when I edit it?</p><p>Dropbox lets me work right away on the file on my computer</p><dl class="image"><dt> <img src="Designer-Source-Control-SkyDriveCheckout.png" alt="" style="width&#58;750px;" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; OneDrive (was SkyDrive) has no option to &quot;check out&quot; here. I have to go to the&#160;browser and check out a file which is on my computer. Better yet, Dropbox doesn't even ask me to check out, it just does it<br></dd></dl></li><li>
      <strong>For me to check out the file and to upload the file to &quot;SharePoint&quot; I have to be on VPN. </strong>
      <p>Our VPN speed is horrible for people outside of Sydney and it takes me the majority of the day to upload 1 Photoshop file. This is unacceptable, because the files designers work with are huge. I.E. those posters of Uly, Mehmet and William are&#160; 54MB… EACH.</p><p>I can use Dropbox and have it sync to Tiago, David, without needing to be on VPN. The files are sync'd as I work so they are never out of date, or &quot;waiting to be uploaded&quot;</p></li><li>
      <strong>When OneDrive (was SkyDrive) has an error, it just sits there and pauses my other files until the error is resolved. </strong>
      <p>Even if the problem is something like &quot;this file is too big for upload.&quot; Somehow one large file prevents my other normal files from being uploaded.</p><p>I have used Dropbox for 3 years and it has never given me an error.</p><dl class="image"><dt> <img src="Designer-Source-Control-SkyDriveUploadPaused.png" alt="" style="width&#58;750px;" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; OneDrive (was SkyDrive) has my last two files just sitting as &quot;upload paused&quot; – these files are perfectly ok to be uploaded but it refuses to do so, even when I ask it to<br></dd></dl></li><li>
      <strong> OneDrive (was SkyDrive) has strange errors that cannot be resolved. </strong> 
      <p>For example, in the screenshot below, I have been getting &quot;Upload pending&quot; when I have repeatedly tried to upload the file. I have no idea what OneDrive is doing. The file is checked out in SharePoint, it's a little big but typical of designer files. And yet, OneDrive sits there, doing nothing and throwing me popup messages about the status being updated.</p><p>Dropbox just works.</p><dl class="image"><dt> <img src="Designer-Source-Control-SkyDriveLoop.png" alt="" style="width&#58;750px;" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; In OneDrive (was SkyDrive), my files are stuck in a &quot;Upload pending&quot; loop. I do not know why, as the files have been checked out and are not particularly large<br></dd></dl></li><li> 
      <strong> OneDrive (was SkyDrive) has problems uploading files. </strong> 
      <p></p><ul><li>In the first box, it decided to upload my file as a new file instead of saving the old one as a version</li><li>In the second box, it <strong>overrode</strong> my file with something that has no file size (probably a broken file.)</li></ul><p></p><p>Thank god that second file is saved in my Dropbox. Dropbox has never broken my files and it knows how to save files with version tracking.</p><dl class="image"><dt> <img src="Designer-Source-Control-SkyDriveError.png" alt="" style="width&#58;750px;" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; OneDrive (was SkyDrive) has both failed to save a file as a new version and uploaded a truncated file<br></dd></dl></li></ol><p>Of course, Dropbox is not perfect. There is the issue of file size limit, especially as the Share Folder takes up a portion of the individual user's account (this is resolved by upgrading to a <a href="https&#58;//www.dropbox.com/help/59/en">Dropbox Business Account</a>). A free account starts off with only 2GB and this is likely not enough especially as your team's shared folder continues to get bigger.</p><p>For developers, see&#58; <a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=2860239f-9812-414a-ad42-6174c928cbb0">Do you know where to keep your files - TFS, SharePoint?</a></p>
