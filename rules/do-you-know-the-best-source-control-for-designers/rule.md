way to share files between designers, it should all be done in Dropbox.</span></p>

</dl><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad">Figure&#58; Bad Example – What seemed like a great idea at the time, SharePoint and Skydrive proved to be plagued with slow response times, upload errors and unresponsiveness.</dd><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"> 
   <img src="/Management/Rules-to-Better-Designers/PublishingImages/Designer-Source-Control-Dropbox.png" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;650px;" /> 
</dl><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Figure&#58; Good Example – Dropbox… the way file sharing is meant to be.</dd><h3>So why do we prefer Dropbox over Skydrive?</h3><ol><li> 
      <strong>Skydrive requires me to check out the file in SharePoint before I make changes. </strong>      
      <p>I have to open a web browser, log in to the intranet, check out the file, and then open the file on my computer before I can make edits to it. This is a shocking amount of busy work for something that is already on my computer. I am unable to work directly from the file on my computer and have it sync automatically. I have to check out a file that is ON my computer. Why can I not check out the file from my computer? Why does it not check out the file when I edit it?</p><p>Dropbox lets me work right away on the file on my computer</p><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"> 
         <img src="/Management/Rules-to-Better-Designers/PublishingImages/Designer-Source-Control-SkyDriveCheckout.png" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;650px;" /> 
      </dl><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; Skydrive has no option to &quot;check out&quot; here. I have to go to browser and check out a file which is on my computer. Better yet, Dropbox doesn't even ask me to check out, it just does it.</dd></li><li> 
      <strong>For me to check out the file and to upload the file to &quot;SharePoint&quot; I have to be on VPN. </strong>      
      <p>Our VPN speed is horrible for people outside of Sydney and it takes me the majority of the day to upload 1 photoshop file. This is unacceptable, because the files designers work with are huge. I.E. those posters of Uly, Mehmet and William are&#160; 54MB… EACH.</p><p>I can use Dropbox and have it sync to Tiago, David, without needing to be on VPN. The files are sync'd as I work so they are never out of date, or &quot;waiting to be uploaded&quot;</p></li><li> 
      <strong>When Skydrive has an error, it just sits there and pauses my other files until the error is resolved. </strong>      
      <p>Even if the problem is something like &quot;this file is too big for upload.&quot; Somehow one large file prevents my other normal files from being uploaded.</p><p>I have used Dropbox for 3 years and it has never given me an error.</p><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"> 
         <img src="/Management/Rules-to-Better-Designers/PublishingImages/Designer-Source-Control-SkyDriveUploadPaused.png" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;650px;" /> 
      </dl><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; Skydrive has my last two files just sitting as &quot;upload paused&quot; – these files are perfectly ok to be uploaded but it refuses to do so, even when I ask it to.</dd></li><li> 
      <strong>      Skydrive has strange errors that cannot be resolved. </strong>
      <p>For example, in the screenshot below, I have been getting &quot;Upload pending&quot; when I have repeatedly tried to upload the file. I have no idea what Skydrive is doing. The file is checked out in SharePoint, it's a little big but typical of designer files. And yet, Skydrive sits there, doing nothing and throwing me popup messages about the status being updated.</p><p>Dropbox just works.</p><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"> 
         <img src="/Management/Rules-to-Better-Designers/PublishingImages/Designer-Source-Control-SkyDriveLoop.png" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;650px;" /> 
      </dl><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; In Skydrive, my files are stuck in a &quot;Upload pending&quot; loop. I do not know why, as the files have been checked out and are not particularly large.</dd></li><li>
      <strong> Skydrive has problems uploading files. </strong>
      <p></p><ul><li>In the first box, it decided to upload my file as a new file instead of saving the old one as a version</li><li>In the second box, it 
            <strong>overrode</strong> my file with something that has no file size (probably a broken file.)</li></ul><p></p><p>Thank god that second file is saved in my Dropbox. Dropbox has never broken my files and it knows how to save files with version tracking.</p><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea"> 
         <img src="/Management/Rules-to-Better-Designers/PublishingImages/Designer-Source-Control-SkyDriveError.png" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;650px;" /> 
      </dl><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureNormal">Figure&#58; Skydrive has both failed to save a file as a new version and uploaded a truncated file.</dd></li></ol><p>Of course, Dropbox is not perfect. There is the issue of file size limit, especially as the Share Folder takes up a portion of the individual user's account (this is resolved by upgrading to a 
   <a href="https&#58;//www.dropbox.com/help/59/en">Dropbox Business Account</a>). A free account starts off with only 2GB and this is likely not enough especially as your team's shared folder continues to get bigger.</p>
