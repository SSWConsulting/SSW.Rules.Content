re-iterate use of ET (and link to rule)
Without scripted test cases but with the freedom to decide what to test and how to test, testers can find it hard to know what to test.

It’s helpful to think in terms of **test ideas**.

defs:

“Test ideas are brief notions about something that could be tested.” Rikard Edgren
“Test Idea: an idea for testing something.” James Bach

The use of heuristics becomes more critical and valuable as you approach the exploratory end of the continuum, to help you come up with test ideas during freestyle exploratory testing.

defs:

A heuristic is a fallible method for solving a problem or making a decision

A heuristic is an experience-based technique for problem solving, learning, and discovery

"A heuristic is a way to help me come up with test ideas" Lee Hawkins

When tasked with testing something new, you don’t necessarily know how to unearth interesting test ideas and so following rules probably doesn’t help. 

Under such conditions of uncertainty (which are normal in software development), look for methods or ways of coming up with test ideas that might work, while acknowledging that they might not - these are heuristics.

You’ll likely build up your own toolbox of heuristics to draw from as you become more familiar with them and realise their power. 
Consistency heuristics are good places to start, e.g. Michael Bolton’s HICCUPPS heuristic.

History. We expect the present version of the system to be consistent with past versions of it.
Image. We expect the system to be consistent with an image that the organization wants to project, with its brand, or with its reputation.
Comparable Products. We expect the system to be consistent with systems that are in some way comparable. This includes other products in the same product line; competitive products, services, or systems; or products that are not in the same category but which process the same data; or alternative processes or algorithms.
Claims. We expect the system to be consistent with things important people say about it, whether in writing (references specifications, design documents, manuals, whiteboard sketches…) or in conversation (meetings, public announcements, lunchroom conversations…).
Users’ Desires. We believe that the system should be consistent with ideas about what reasonable users might want. 
Product. We expect each element of the system (or product) to be consistent with comparable elements in the same system.
Purpose. We expect the system to be consistent with the explicit and implicit uses to which people might put it.
Statutes. We expect a system to be consistent with laws or regulations that are relevant to the product or its use.




2. Place your content here. Markdown is your friend. See this [example rule](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/rule) for all the things you can do with Rules.
3. Submit your rule for review.
4. Add your rule to a category. See [How to Add and Edit Categories and Top Categories](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Rules.Content/wiki/How-to-Add-and-Edit-Categories-and-Top-Categories).
