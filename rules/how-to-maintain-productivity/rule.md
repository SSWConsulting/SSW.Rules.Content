It’s not always easy to stay on-flow and maintain productivity in a distracting environment. Here are 3 proven strategies to help you maintain productivity:

1. Create TODO lists on your favourite note taking tech:
    * list for most important tasks (MIT) - what I would like to get done today
    * for new features - when developing a new feature, a concise TODO list of what needs to be done
    * for additional tasks - any distractions such as additional tasks to be completed, can be noted on the appropriate list, without breaking concentration or stopping to focus on something else.
2. [Pomodoro technique](https&#58;//francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique) - This technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.
3. Have a soundscape or background music to keep you focused
