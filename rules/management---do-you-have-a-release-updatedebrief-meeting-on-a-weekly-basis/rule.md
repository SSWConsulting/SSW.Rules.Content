<span class='intro'> 
  <p>Every week&#160;the project manager should meet with the client to conduct an external &quot;Test Please&quot; as well as to discuss the status of the release. <br></p>
<p><b>Tip #1&#58; </b>Choose the same day each week (for example SSW chooses Tuesday)<br>
<b>Tip #2&#58; </b>While it is better to conduct an internal &quot;Test Please&quot; before the meeting (for example SSW chooses Friday), this &quot;Release Update/Debrief Meeting&quot; should proceed (even if it hasn't been completed).</p>
<p>This is the agenda&#58;​​</p> </span>


  <ol>
    <li>Status of original work items - are they all done?</li>
    <li>External <a href="/Pages/InternalTestPlease.aspx">Test Please</a> - go through the application and get the clients thoughts. Many&#160;issues they&#160;see, will already be reported by the internal &quot;Test Please&quot;. Send emails to the new ones.</li>
    <li>Triage these additional work items - try to move all to the next release</li>
    <li>Approval for additional work items/budget overruns&#160;- talk $$ <br>e.g. look at the &quot;Actual&quot; and &quot;Estimate&quot; figures on the top of the report</li>
    <li>Release sign-off - &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;?</li>
</ol>
<p>If &quot;Yes&quot;</p>
<ol>
    <li>Ask the client for a mark /10 for the release</li>
    <li>Ask the client if you can do a deployment to Production?</li>
    <li>Ask for Approval for next release &#160;</li>
</ol>
<p>There are tools to help you do this&#58;</p>
