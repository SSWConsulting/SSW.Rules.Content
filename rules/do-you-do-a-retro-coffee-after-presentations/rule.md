<p>Presentations at User Groups and other events are great for connecting with the developer community. After giving a presentation, you should always follow up with a few attendees to get feedback, find out what projects they’re working on, and potentially how you can help.</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>Pick a few attendees at random to follow up with, give them a call and ask if you can buy them a coffee. You should ask them&#58; </p>
<ul><li>What they thought of the session and whether they have any feedback</li>
<li>Whether there are any related topics they’d like to learn more about</li>
<li>What projects they are working on at the moment</li>
<li>Whether there are any issues they’re having with those projects</li></ul>
