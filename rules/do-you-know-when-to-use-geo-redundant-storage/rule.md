Data in Azure Storage accounts is protected by replication. Deciding how far to replicate it is a balance between safety and cost.

#### 

**Locally redundant storage (LRS)**

* Ma  intains three copies of your data.
* Is replicated three times within a single facility in a single region.
* Protects your data from normal hardware failures, but not from the failure of a single facility.
* Less expensive than GRS
* Use when:
    * o Data is of low importance â€“ e.g. for test websites, or testing virtual machines
    * o Data can be easily reconstructed
    * o Data is non-critical
    * o Data governance requirements restrict data to a single region


**Geo-redundant storage (GRS).**

* The default when you create it storage accounts.
* Maintains six copies of your data.
* D  ata is replicated three times within the primary region, and is also replicated three times in a secondary region hundreds of miles away from the primary region
* In the event of a failure at the primary region, Azure Storage will failover to the secondary region.
* Ensures that your data is durable in two separate regions.
* Use when:
    * o Data cannot be recovered if lost

**Read access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS).**  
* Replicates your data to a secondary geographic location (same as GRS)
* P  rovides read access to your data in the secondary location
* Allows you to access your data from either the primary or the secondary location, in the event that one location becomes unavailable.
* Use when:
    * o Data is critical, and access is required to both the primary and the secondary regions
