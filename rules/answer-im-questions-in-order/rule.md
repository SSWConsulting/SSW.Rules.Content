Sometimes people fire a few questions at you and the tendency is to answer the last question first. A clear approach if you receive more than 1 question in an IM chat, is to answer each question in order, keeping the conversation is clearer. It's also a good idea to repeat the keywords of each question in your answer so there is no chance of confusion.
