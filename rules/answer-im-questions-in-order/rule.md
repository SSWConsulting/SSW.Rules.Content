Sometimes people fire a few questions at you and the tendency is to answer in all kinds of ways that can make our signal to noise ratio poor.

Tips when answering IMs:

* Answer each question in order

* Repeat the keywords of each question

* Avoid grouping your messages together [as per the rule](/separate-messages)
