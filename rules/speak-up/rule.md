Throughout your career, you might come across a scenario that feels unfair. In these situations, communication is vital for resolving conflict and making all parties feel content with the result. Let's take a look at some scenarios that cause this problem, and what kind of communication tools can be used to resolve them...

<!--endintro-->

There are many situations where unfairness may be perceived. For example:
* Someone might get a promotion when you felt you deserved it more
* A group of employees might be left out of a public yearly bonus
* A colleague might be put on a project that someone else is more suited to

There are three perspectives to consider and each has different strategies for maintaining a good working environment.

### Manager

* Communicate decisions - By communicating the reasons for every decision you set the right expectations for employees and prevent them from feeling frustrated.
* Avoid unfair situations - Steer clear of situations that could be perceived as unfair where possible. For example, in the case of gifts either keep things private or distribute them equally.

### Receiver

* Remain humble - You might feel proud of your new accomplishment and that's awesome. However, make sure you don't advertise or boast about it because that may cause resentment among your colleagues and foster a bad working environment.

### Neglected individual

* Ask questions - Asking questions about the reasons for decisions will help you understand why it happened and what you need to do to make sure it happens for you next time!
* Speak up - If you feel things are unfair speak up and make it known! The longer you wait, the worse it becomes. Speaking up will give the person making the decision a chance to rectify the issue and keep yourself and your team more harmonious.
