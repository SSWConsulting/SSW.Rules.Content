<p>​​​​Any DateTime fields must be converted to universal time from the application to the stored procedures when storing data into the database.<br></p><p>We can simplify dealing with datetime conversions by using a date and time API such as <a href="https&#58;//nodatime.org/">Noda TIme</a>.<br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>Noda Time uses the concept of an Instant representing a global point in time, which is first converted to UTC time and then to the users local time when required for display.​<br>An Instant is the number of nanoseconds since January 1st 1970. Using an Instant gives more granularity than datetime because it uses nanoseconds rather than ticks (100 nanoseconds).​​<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-CodeArea">//------ .NET DateTime Examples<br>int year, month, day;<br>int hour, minute, second;<br><br>long nowInTicks = DateTime.Now.Ticks;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;//&#160; &#160; &#160; 637158251390332189<br>DateTime now = DateTime.Now;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;<br>DateTime nowUtc = DateTime.UtcNow;<br>DateTime date = new DateTime(2020, 1, 2);&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; //&#160; &#160; &#160; 2/01/2020 12&#58;00&#58;00 AM<br>TimeSpan time = new TimeSpan(16, 20, 0);&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;//&#160; &#160; &#160; 16&#58;20&#58;00<br>DateTime dateTime = date + time;&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160; &#160; &#160; //&#160; &#160; &#160; 2/01/2020 4&#58;20&#58;00 PM<br><br>date = dateTime.Date;<br>time = dateTime.TimeOfDay;<br>year = date.Year;<br>month = date.Month;<br>day = date.Day;<br>hour = time.Hours;<br>minute = time.Minutes;<br>second = time.Seconds;<br><br>int startDate = (int)date.DayOfWeek;<br>int target = (int)DayOfWeek.Wednesday;<br>if (target &lt;= startDate)<br>&#160; &#160; target += 7;<br>DateTime nextWednesday = date.AddDays(target - startDate);&#160; &#160; &#160;//&#160; &#160; &#160;8/01/2020 12&#58;00&#58;00 AM<br><br>startDate = (int)date.DayOfWeek;<br>target = (int)DayOfWeek.Friday;<br>if (target &gt; startDate)<br>&#160; &#160; target -= 7;<br>DateTime lastFriday = date.AddDays(-(startDate - target));&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;//&#160; &#160; &#160;27/12/2019 12&#58;00&#58;00 AM<br><br>TimeSpan t1 = TimeSpan.FromDays(1.0);<br>TimeSpan t2 = TimeSpan.FromHours(1.0);<br>​<br>int timespanCheck = TimeSpan.Compare(t1, t2);<br>TimeSpan longestSpan;<br>TimeSpan shortestSpan;<br>if(timespanCheck &gt; 0)<br>&#123;<br>&#160; &#160; longestSpan = t1;<br>&#160; &#160; shortestSpan = t2;<br>&#125;&#160;<br>else if(timespanCheck &lt; 0)<br>&#123;<br>&#160; &#160; shortestSpan = t1;<br>&#160; &#160; longestSpan = t2;<br>&#125;<br></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad">Figure&#58; Bad Example -&#160;​​Using .Net DateTime to manipulate dates and times.<br></dd><p class="ssw15-rteElement-CodeArea">//------&#160; &#160; Noda&#160;Time Examples<br>int year, month, day;<br>int hour, minute, second;<br><br>Instant nowAsInstant = SystemClock.Instance.GetCurrentInstant(); //&#160; &#160;2020-01-28T05&#58;18&#58;26Z<br><br>DateTimeZone zone = DateTimeZoneProviders.Tzdb[&quot;Australia/Melbourne&quot;];<br>ZonedClock utcClock = SystemClock.Instance.InUtc();<br>ZonedClock localClock = SystemClock.Instance.InZone(zone);<br>LocalDate ntDate = new LocalDate(2020, 1, 2);&#160; &#160;//&#160; &#160; &#160; Thursday, 2 January 2020<br>LocalTime ntTime = new LocalTime(16, 20);&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;//&#160; &#160; &#160; 4&#58;20&#58;00 PM<br>LocalDateTime ntdateTime = ntDate.At(ntTime);&#160; &#160;//&#160; &#160; &#160; 2/01/2020 4&#58;20&#58;00 PM<br><br>ntdateTime.Deconstruct(out ntDate, out ntTime);<br>ntDate.Deconstruct(out year, out month, out day);<br>ntTime.Deconstruct(out hour, out minute, out second);<br><br>LocalDate ntNextWednesday = ntDate.Next(IsoDayOfWeek.Wednesday); //&#160; &#160; Wednesday, 8 January 2020<br>LocalDate ntLastFriday = ntDate.Previous(IsoDayOfWeek.Friday);&#160; &#160;//&#160; &#160; Friday, 27 December 2019<br><br>Duration d1 = Duration.FromDays(1);<br>Duration d2 = Duration.FromHours(1);<br>Duration longestDuration&#160;= Duration.Max(d1, d2);<br>Duration shortestDuration&#160;= Duration.Min(d1, d2);&#160;<br></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood">Figure&#58; Good Example - Using Noda Time to manipulate dates and times.<br></dd><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureNormal"><br></dd><p>When retrieving data from the database it must be converted back to the local time of the user.</p><p>That way you get an accurate representation of&#160;the time someone entered data into the database (i.e. the DateUpdated field).<br>The exception to this rule, however, is for already existing databases that deal with DateTime as part of their queries.<br>e.g. SSW Time PRO.NET is an application that allows employees to enter their timesheet.
