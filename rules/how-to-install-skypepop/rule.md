All company receptionists should install SkypePOP on your PC.
 
This will enable you to get Dynamics CRM contact popups on incoming calls, for example:

1. Bob Northwind calls you
2. His CRM contact will open up in your browser (by default before you pickup)
3. You now know exactly what you last talked about (by looking at the recent Activities and Opportunities)




There is one limitation to SkypePOP - forwarded calls won't give you useful information, as SkypePOP will show you the contact details of the person forwarding the call, not the external client. That's why we recommend using SkypePOP the following way:

<!--endintro-->

Only receptionists should have SkypePOP installed.

1.      An incoming call is taken by the receptionist

2.      The CRM contact pops up (or a "new contact" form if the number is not already in your CRM):

4.      Inform the person the call is being transferred to that you have sent him an email with the CRM Contact

5.      Wow! No one has to open the CRM manually anymore
