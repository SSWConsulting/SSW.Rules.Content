With a password manager, you don't have to remember that strong, unique password for every website. The password manager stores them for you and even helps you generate new, random ones.Â

It does not matter which one. There are many great tools out there for example:

* **[KeePass](https://keepass.info/)** - keeps all passwords in one database locked by a master key, which should be accessible only by the few people you trust.
* **[1Password](https://1password.com/)** - syncs passwords and personal data across all your devices. It's not quite as slick or capable as many competitors, but it's still an easy-to-use utility
* **[Keeper Password Manager & Digital Vault](https://keepersecurity.com/vault/)** - an elegant and security-first password management solution available for all popular platforms and browsers.
* **[Lastpass](https://www.lastpass.com/)** - matches the capabilities of other top paid password managers and is easy to use. Platform syncing limitations for the free version make it significantly less useful than it was
