<span class='intro'> <p>
                When a prospective client gets a quote for a huge price it's like giving them a slap in the face.
                Break your proposals into a series of releases, where each is&#160;1&#160;or more sprints,&#160;and 
                clients can choose to proceed with a smaller financial commitment (such as just getting the mock-ups 
                done) than if they were committing to the whole project. Often, small financial commitments will 
                lead to bigger ones.
                </p> </span>

<p> This approach also allows you to side-step common delaying tactics of prospective clients by making it easier to get the project moving. </p><dl class="image"><dt>
