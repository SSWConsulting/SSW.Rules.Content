Companies have a lot of information and standards – some of it is **public** (E.g. SSW Rules), some of it is **private** (E.g. SSW Intranet). When there is thousands of documents, new employees should be given a guided process so they know what is important. 

<!--endintro-->

When someone joins a company, it is a stressful event... they have to remember people's names, references to where things are... there is a lot of assumed knowledge and explanations of "this is how we do things". 

New employees often get inconsistently onboarded depending on who they got their initial information from. 

An induction system is a way to solve these problems. SSW uses and recommends is **[SugarLearning.com](https://www.sugarlearning.com/)**. \
\
What SugarLearning does is aggregate your learning items into the one space to make it easy for you to complete your induction. Once you've done your reading, the follow-up quizzes help you confirm what you have learned.

It's also a great continuous learning tool that shows employees where to find relevant information and also tests their knowledge. It especially useful when a process changes, as a learning item can be invalidated and all employees informed to complete a new process. 

Certain jobs have a module and completing them gives each employee a license to do that job.

### What's what?

> **SugarLearning** is an induction program for things you must complete before start working… E.g. Before you do a Spec Review, you must have done the Module - Spec Review. It’s like getting your license.\
> \
> The **Intranet** is the location of all information, standards and "how-tos that must be private. In some project we have specific **Wikis** for those too.\
> \
> **Rules** is where we kept all information, standards and "how-tos that can be public.
