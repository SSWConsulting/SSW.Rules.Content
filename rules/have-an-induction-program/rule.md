Companies have a lot of information and standards – some of it is **public** (E.g. SSW Rules), some of it is **private** (E.g. SSW Intranet). When there is thousands of documents, your new employees should be given a guided process so they know what is important. 

The induction system that SSW uses and recommends is **[SugarLearning.com](https://www.sugarlearning.com/)**. 

<!--endintro-->

When someone joins a company, it is a stressful event... they have to remember people's names, references to where things are, there is a lot of assumed knowledge, and explanations of "this is how we do things. New people often get inconsistently onboarded depending on who they got their initial information from. \
\
What SugarLearning does is aggregate your learning items into the one space to make it easy for you to complete your induction. Once you've done your reading, the follow-up quizzes help you confirm what you have learned.

It's also a great continuous learning tool that shows employees where to find relevant information and also tests their knowledge. It especially useful when a process changes as the learning item can be invalidated and all employees informed to complete a new process. 

Certain jobs have a module and completing them is like giving them a license to do that job.



### What's what?

> **SugarLearning** is an induction program for things you must complete before start working… E.g. Before you do a Spec Review, you must have done Module Spec Review. It’s like getting your license. If you find exceptions please let us know.\
> \
> The **Intranet** is the location of all information, standards and how to’s that must be private. In some project we have specific **Wiki’s** for those too.\
> \
> **Rules** is where we kept all information, standards and how to’s that can be public.
