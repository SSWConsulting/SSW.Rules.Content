Most companies keep their presentations on an internal resource eg. SharePoint ... these days more likely Teams | Files ....and there is still a place for that (especially if you don't want to share it).

The best place for presentations (PPT) and other resources such as PDFs or a bunch of URLs is in a public location. The best public location is GitHub.

Did you know that if you keep your PowerPoint presentations in a public location, it makes it easier for your attendees to access later?

<!--endintro-->

There are a few ways to do this:

* **Option 1:** [Slideshare](http://slideshare.net/)
More at: [Do you know to Slideshare your PowerPoint Presentations?](/do-you-know-to-slideshare-your-powerpoint-before-the-presentation)
* **Option 2:** [Notist](https://noti.st/)
A design & video collaboration, prototyping & workflow app for creative teams.
* **Option 3:** Sharing an OneDrive link (ouch - they expire üî•)
* **Option 4:** GitHub (E.g. https://github.com/sswconsulting/presentations
      )
