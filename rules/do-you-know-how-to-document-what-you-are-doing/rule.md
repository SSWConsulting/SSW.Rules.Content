When are recording a choice (best way of doing something) you should create a rule. If you are explaining how you did something it should be a blog post.

Everytime you are writing a really long email, ask yourself if it would be better as a lining blog post rather than a one off email.

**Hint:** If you the extra mile, you will end up with one or more rules + a blog post, and your email will need just a link to them.
