If you find yourself developing a decision process to make a choice, that process should be documented in a rule. If you are explaining how you did something to solve a problem, you should record that in a blog post.

Any time you find yourself writing a long email, ask yourself whether it should be recorded in a blog post, rather than just in an email, where everyone who might find it useful can see it, not just the people on the email chain.

### Does it make a rule?

If you go the extra mile, you will end up with one or more rules based on the blog post, and your email will need just a link to them.

On these cases, always link the blog post to the rule(s) and vice versa.

For example, you could add something like this to your post: _"This blog post is consistent with the good example on the rule {{ Rule URL }}}"._

Likewise, the rule should point to the blog post. It's awesome for SEO.
