If you find yourself developing a decision process to make a choice, that process should be documented in a rule. If you are explaining how you did something to solve a problem, you should record that in a blog post.

Any time you find yourself writing a long email, ask yourself whether it should be recorded in a blog post, rather than just in an email, where everyone who might find it useful can see it, not just the people on the email chain.

**Tip:** For good SEO, the blog post should point to a rule and vice versa.\
For example, you could add something like this to your post: "This blog post is consistent with the good example on the rule XXX". \
Likewise, the rule should point to the blog post.

**Hint:** If you the extra mile, you will end up with one or more rules + a blog post, and your email will need just a link to them.
