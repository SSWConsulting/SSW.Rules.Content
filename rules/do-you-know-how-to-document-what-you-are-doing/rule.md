<span class='intro'> <p>If you are recording a choice you should create a rule, if you are explaining how you did something, it should be a blog post.</p><p>If you are writing a really long email, ask yourself if it would be better as a lining blog post rather than a one off email.</p><p>Also see&#58; <a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=257bcb90-884d-49bd-8e15-e639c70f7de1">Do you know to make what you can public?</a><br></p> </span>
