When you add an image to a website or application, it is so useful to add a figure underneath it to describe your image. Tip: Prefix it with the actual word "Figure: ".

(This is the same as how Microsoft Word does it when you add a caption.)

It's the best way of ensuring you catch users' attention to the content of your page. When you're scanning a newspaper for interesting articles, you'll check out the pictures, read the accompanying description, and if it sounds interesting you'll go back and read the article.

<!--endintro-->

Users read websites in a similar fashion. Catch their attention with an image, and then keep it with a useful description. Don't just describe what the image is; say what it's used for in the context of the document.


::: good  
![Figure: Good Example - Some nice useful text describing the image](good-caption.jpg)  
:::

It is especially important that images and captions serve a purpose, as opposed to graphics which are there solely for design.

### Tip #1 - Bold your captions



::: greybox
[image]

:::



::: bad
Figure: [Description…] (not bolded)
:::


::: greybox
[image]

:::




::: good
Figure: [Description…] (bolded is best)

:::


### Tip #2 - Describe the actions 

Especially for screenshots, it is a good idea to have your figure describe the action the user would take:


   &lt;

::: greybox
[image]

:::




::: bad
Figure: This is the screen  
:::


::: greybox
[image]  
:::




::: good
Figure: On the screen, choose the execution method  
:::




A good example of this can be seen in the figures at [SSW Code Auditor User Guide](https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/UserGuide.aspx) page.

### Tip #3 - Give bad and good examples 

It's recommended that you use "bad" and "good" examples to clearly explain the DOs and DON'Ts.
Bear in mind to always show the bad example first, then good example, like below:




::: greybox
To print your document:
1. Select File | Print. The Print dialog <mark>should</mark> now show.
2. Select the number of copies and click Print. The file <mark>should</mark> now print.  
:::


::: bad
Figure: Bad Example - Using 'should' implies uncertainty  
:::


::: greybox
To print your document: 
1. Select File | Print. The Print dialog <mark>is shown</mark>.
2. Select the number of copies and click Print. The file <mark>will</mark> now print.

:::


::: good
Figure: Good example - Using present or future tense implies confidence
