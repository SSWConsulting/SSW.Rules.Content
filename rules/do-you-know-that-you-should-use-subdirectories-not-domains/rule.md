​​If you’re building a website today, and your business needs to create addresses for different online directories, it can be hard to figure out the best way to go about it. <br><br>There’s a lot of debate about this topic on the internet, so the question to ask yourself is&#58; “Should I use subdirectories or subdomains?”<br>

However, if you already have a domain and a lot of legacy structures in place, using subdirectories could be a big change and might not be worth it. You would need to update your properties in Google Analytics, your Google Search Console settings, a lot of redirects, and much more.<br></p><p><br></p><p>Keep in mind,&#160;Google is now&#160;s​​mart enough to work this out for you&#160;– it's just&#160;an extra step for Google’s bots.
