There are a lot of different CRM solutions on the market.Â We would never suggest to develop a CRM solution from scratch. Instead pick an existing solution and customize it for your needs.

<!--endintro-->

The main choices for CRM solutions are:

* [Salesforce](http&#58;//www.salesforce.com/crm/ "Salesforce")
* [Microsoft CRM](https&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/MicrosoftCRM.aspx "Microsoft CRM ")


At SSW we implemented a lot of CRM services based on Microsoft CRM. 
 The experience with this solution showed us high trust in using MS CRM as a base for future business needs.

 Read the [rules to better Microsoft CRM](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulestoBetterMicrosoftCRM.aspx "SSW Rules to Better Microsoft CRM")to get an idea what MS CRM can do for you.
