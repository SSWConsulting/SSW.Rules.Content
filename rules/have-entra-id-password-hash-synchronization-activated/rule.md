Microsoft Entra ID - formerly Azure Active Directory, Password Hash Synchronization (PHS) is one of the methods you can use if you want to have your identities synced to the cloud, alongside Pass-through Authentication (PTA) and Federation with AD FS.
If you have a hybrid identity in place with Entra ID, chances are you are already synchronizing password hashes to the cloud with Microsoft Entra Connect formerly Azure AD Connect.

<!--endintro-->

Entra ID PHS synchronizes the password in on-premises Active Directory with Entra ID so you can use your on-premises password to login to cloud services, like Azure or Office 365. It also allows you to implement Seamless Sign-On for domain-joined machines, so users don't need to login twice when opening their emails in a browser, for example.

Entra ID PHS also allows you to have an absolute lean infrastructure on-premises, as the only needed moving part is Entra Connect to be installed in a server or Domain Controller. No agents or internet-facing machines necessary.

The web requests don't even come to your server, they are server by Microsoft's big pool of servers around the globe!
