At events where there are multiple presenters it's important that they know the presentation order so they can be ready to present at the right time.
The presentation order is also valuable for the audience and the AV team.

Before presentations start, make a presentation run sheet and share it with the presenters, audience and AV team.

If the presentations are on a tight schedule, note the time each presentation is expected to start to help keep the event on track.
