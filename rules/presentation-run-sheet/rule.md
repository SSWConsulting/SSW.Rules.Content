In events with multiple speakers clarity on the presentation order is crucial. Presenters need this to be ready to present at the right time, while attendees and the AV team benefit from knowing the flow.

Before the sessions begin, make a presentation run sheet and distribute it among the speakers, attendees, and AV team.

For those streaming the event, introduce the next speaker in the chat beforehand. This can enhance the stream experience by clearly segmenting the discussion for each presentation.

Tight schedules demand precise timing. Note the expected start time for each talk on the run sheet, helping everyone stay on track.
