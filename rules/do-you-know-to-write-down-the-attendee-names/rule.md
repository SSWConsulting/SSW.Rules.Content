<p>If the presenter has a small audience (say under 20), then it is best to know the attendee names (or at least quite a few of them) so you are able to communicate better with them throughout the day. </p><p>The problem is you will forget their names after they introduce themselves. 
</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>The fix is to have a piece of paper, (already divided up) so you can write down the names on it in the order that people are sitting.</p><p>This ends up being a great reference you can use to address questions directly to participants using their name. This ensures that attendees keep focused as they may directly have questions referencing them.</p><dl class="image"><dt><img src="/PublishingImages/classroom.jpg" alt="" />
