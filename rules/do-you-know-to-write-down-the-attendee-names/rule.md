If the presenter has a small audience (say under 20), then it is best to know the attendee names (or at least quite a few of them) so you are able to communicate better with them throughout the day.

The problem is you will forget their names after they introduce themselves.

The fix is to have a piece of paper, (already divided up) so you can write down the names on it in the order that people are sitting.

This ends up being a great reference you can use to address questions directly to participants using their name. This ensures that attendees keep focused as they may directly have questions referencing them.
