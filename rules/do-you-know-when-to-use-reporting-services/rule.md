Like any solution, Reporting Services has its pros and cons. From our experience, we have discovered these things about Reporting Services:
<!--endintro-->
Cons

* Parameters - you are forced to use built-in controls
* Query string - when you change the parameters and refresh a report, the values do not appear directly in the query string, making it hard to copy/paste URLs
* Can't separate SQL into a strongly-typed dataset or middle-tier object like in ASP.NET
* There are potential difficulties with the deployment of RS reports and the exposing of them. However, once we have the infrastructure...

 **Pros** 

* You can develop read only reports faster in Reporting Services than ASP.NET
* Maintenance with RS is easier than ASP .NET, as with most cases you don't have to write any code
* Flexibility with groupings and totals is easier. In ASP.NET you would need to iterate through the DataSet, keeping variables with the totals
* Parameters are built-in. In ASP.NET there is code
* Drilldown interactivity. In ASP.NET you need to code up a treeview
* Users can have reports automatically emailed to them on a schedule
* Users can export natively to PDF and XLS, plus a variety of other popular formats

So in conclusion, if you will only ever need 1 report, go with ASP.NET - it is easier to get up and running. If you plan to have more than one report, use Reporting Services - it's worth the time to configure.
