  <p>When emailing external parties, it is a good idea to CC the other colleagues within your organization that may have an interest in the email. Some of the benefits of CC'ing others include&#58;</p>
<ul>
    <li>It can save time </li>
    <li>Gives the email more credibility if you have CC'd others in your organization </li>
    <li>Colleagues may correct your mistakes </li>
</ul>

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <p>In addition, I often see people replying only to the sender of the email, ignoring the fact that there were other persons included in the original email. Obviously the original sender intended to keep everyone in the loop, so it would be polite to CC everyone included on the original communication. The converse is true also - don't cc people unnecessarily - you're just adding to the email problem! <br>

<p>If the original email was to an alias with many subscribers, in general you should not Reply All. <br>
Also if the sender requests a <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Redirect/Netlingo.htm">'little r'</a> <img height="11" width="17" src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Images/LeaveSite.gif" alt="You are going to a site outside of SSW" /> reply, then you should not Reply All. </p>

<p><strong>Exception</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>If not all recipients need to be informed </li>
    <li>The opinions of the rest of the recipients do not matter as they are unlikely to disagree <font class="ms-rteCustom-YellowBorderBox">We have a program called <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/LookOut/">SSW LookOut! for Outlook</a> to check for this rule. </font>
    <p>It checks this for you, and would raise a warning like this one&#58;</p>
