You can upload staff profile pictures into Active Directory. Exchange and Lync will automatically use these profile pictures.  

<!--endintro-->

Using a free third party tool AD Photo Edit tool which can be downloaded from     [cjwdev.co.uk](http://www.cjwdev.co.uk/) you can upload staff profile pictures into AD. You need to run the application with Domain Admin rights. After you have uploaded the picture for a user it will take some time for the change to be replicated through to Exchange and Lync if you have use these solutions.
