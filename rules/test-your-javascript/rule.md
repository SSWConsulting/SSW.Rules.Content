The need to build rich web user interfaces is resulting in more and more JavaScript in our applications.

Because JavaScript does not have the safeguards of strong typing and compile-time checking, it is just as important to unit test your JavaScript as your server-side code.

<!--endintro-->

You can write unit tests for JavaScript using:

* [Karma](https&#58;//karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html)
* [Jasmine](https&#58;//jasmine.github.io/)
* [Jest](https&#58;//jestjs.io/)
