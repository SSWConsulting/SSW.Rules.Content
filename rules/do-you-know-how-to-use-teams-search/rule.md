<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Teams search is designed to help you quickly find the files you are collaborating on.​<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">From the main search box, you can search for:</p><ul class="ssw15-rteElement-P"><li>Teams</li><li>Channels</li><li>Files</li><li>Messages</li><li>People​</li></ul>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>If you start typing in the search box, you will see all Teams and Channels that matches your query:<br></p><dl class="image"><dt>

   </dt><dd>Figure: Search results for "Training". The 1st two results are Teams, the 3rd one is a channel.<br><br>Teams only show up with their title, while channels show with the name of the associated Team underneath</dd></dl><dl class="image"><dt>

   </dt><dd>Figure: Teams result</dd></dl><dl class="image"><dt><img src="teams-search-3.png" alt="teams-search-3.png" /></dt><span style="color:#555555;font-weight:bold;">Figure: Channel associated to a Team result</span></dl><p class="ssw15-rteElement-InfoBox"> 
   <b>Warning:</b> If you hit enter, you will be redirected to the Messages, Files & People results. To see the Teams/Channels matching your query, simply click the search box again</p><p></p><p>Once you've hit "Enter", you can search through the different tabs to find messages, people or files that match your query across all teams</p><dl class="image"><dt>
      <img src="teams-search-4.jpg" alt="teams-search-4.jpg" />
   </dt><dd>Figure: Use the 3 built-in tabs to search through the different categories</dd></dl><p>You can also use built in filters to refine your search, by clicking the "Filter" icon in Messages or Files tabs: </p><dl class="image"><dt>

   </dt><dd>Figure: Built in filters for Messages (see #3)</dd></dl><p class="ssw15-rteElement-InfoBox"> 
   <b>Important:</b> Even though Teams search gives you quick access to all your messages and documents; the search is scoped to ONLY Teams, which means you cannot search for files hosted on SharePoint, OneDrive, other Office365 products (i.e. Delve/UserProfile) or external sources (i.e. Sugarlearning.com, Rules.SSW.com.au etc...). For this reason, it is advised to use the SharePoint Search instead.</p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Related Rule​<br></h3><p></p><ul><li>
