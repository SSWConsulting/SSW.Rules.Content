Do you believe in being verbose in your code (don't compress code and don't use too many ternary operators)? 

<!--endintro-->

Different developers have different opinions.  It is important your developers work as a team and decide together how verbose their code should be.

What is your opinion on this?  Contribute to the discussion on [Stack Overflow](http&#58;//stackoverflow.com/questions/2765360/ternary-operators-in-c-sharp).
