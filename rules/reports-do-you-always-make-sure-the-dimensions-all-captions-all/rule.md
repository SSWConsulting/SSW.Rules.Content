When you are carrying out reporting (using Reporting  Services) based on some OLAP cube you should change the "All Caption"  property of each dimension to be have the value "All". By default the  caption for the dimension will be "All " (e.g. All  Products). This default is distracting when used in reporting solutions  and doesn't particularly clarify anything anyway.
