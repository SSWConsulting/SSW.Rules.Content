A common mistake for developers is to say _"See you later, call me sometime next month."_

If you don't create another appointment straight away, you and the client may forget. On your last day of consulting with a client, you should **always book in the next date**.

::: info
Be aware of the common blockage people get, which the client is saying _"How about I check my calendar and get back to you?"_

Often this never happens.
:::

A better approach is to minimize risk by saying **youâ€™re penciling it in**, with the option to cancel or reschedule if needed. It is also a good idea to add urgency by mentioning that your calendar fills up quickly.

::: greybox
_"My calendar fills up really quick, how about I pencil you in... say in 2 weeks' time?"_

Then create the appointment rather than remembering it later.

_"Don't forget you can cancel or reschedule it anytime."_

## What if it is your last day at the client, and you are not finished?

If, at the end of the day, work hasn't been fully tested or is incomplete and you haven't been booked in for the next day, tell the Product Owner (PO) that issues may arise and further work is likely to be required. After the conversation, email the PO and Cc your manager to confirm that further work is required.

E.g. _"As per our conversation, this work has not yet been tested and may still include bugs. At this stage, you would prefer if we did not continue to work tomorrow, but I do recommend that we come in and finish soon."_
