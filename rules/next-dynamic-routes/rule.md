NextJS supports dynamic routes out of the box, meaning you can create routes from dynamic data at request or build time. This is especially useful for sites such as blogs that have large amounts of content.

You can create a dynamically routed page by wrapping a folders name in square brackets. 
Eg: [filename] or [slug].
