**Focus is to explain the "how" on this page**

Load testing places a simulated "load" or demand on your web application and measures how it responds to that load, recording such valuable metrics as:


* Throughput rates
* Resource and environment utilization (e.g. CPU, physical memory, etc.)
* Error rates
* Load balancer performance

Load testing tools are designed to help you perform load testing, by recording metrics about the application as the load is varied and allowing you to visualize where user load impacts performance and/or causes application errors.


Ultimately the tool used will depend on the number of users you want to target and what infrastructure you have available. 
Most commercial tools will support up to 50 virtual users in the load test but on your hardware. Alternatively, for more users you should use cloud based offerings like:

choose tooling based on #users, infra, tool cost model

cloud vs. own hardware and why

open source vs. commercial and why
