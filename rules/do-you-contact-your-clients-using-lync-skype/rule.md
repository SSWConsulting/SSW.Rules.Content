Having your clients as Instant Messenger contacts can improve your efficiency in project work. You can get a fast solution to road blocks and solve little problems quickly, as well as develop a better relationship!

Of course any important chats should be     [confirmed via email](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulestoBetterInstantMessenger.aspx#ImportantChatsEmail).

Hey Simon,

I find having my clients available onÂ Skype is extremely useful. Are you on Skype? If so, can I please add you as a contact? I'll add the above email address, let me know if you use a different one.

Cheers

Figure: It's easy to get your clients on Skype, you only have to ask!
