This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field).
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>NOTE&#58; Delete your footer when you send emails internally, it's unnecessary. </p>
<p>If you are on site at a customer, you want colleagues to be able to give you a call without asking the office what your mobile number is. In this case, you should include your mobile and/or temp number for internal emails (e.g.Jonny Trees | On Site | 0412 xxx xxx). </p>
