Aligning expectations with stakeholders is key to success, especially for creative content where the outcome is very variable. Make sure you define what kinds of videos need what quality level.

### Gold

**Definition**

- Extra equipment needed to film, more filming locations, lots of B-Roll, many rounds of feedback, high level of audio post and colour grading etc.
