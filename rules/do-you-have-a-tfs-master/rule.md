The best way of getting the most out of TFS is to have a "TFS Master". A TFS Master is like a Scrum Master but is only interested in helping you get 100% from TFS and it's perfectly fine for them to be part of the developmentÂ team.

It's important to note that a TFS Master is not a management position. It's simply a role that encourages the team to use TFS in the best way possible. With a specialist knowledge of TFS, they're in the best position to know what should change and what could be done better.

Some of the things they should focus on are:

* Taking you beyond TFS as just a source control system
* Using TFS to help you on a proper ALM road
* Making sure that automated builds are created and managed properly by the developers
* Managing the build servers if additional help is needed (builds themselves are the responsibility of the developers)
* Checking the builds are fit for purpose, and that unit tests are included
* Checking that deployment is working properly
* Checking the right check-in policies are enabled and developers are leaving meaningful check-in or commit messages
* Ensuring code analysis is enabled and getting stronger
* Ensuring Code Auditor is running
* Cleaning up unused Workspaces (this removes old check-outs by default)
* Making sure all patches are applied to the servers (they might not do the work, but they make sure it's being done)
* If the team is using TFVC with Server Workspaces, sending out check-in warnings every week to people which have left over check-outs as per the [Do you make small changes and check in early and often?](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterSourceControlwithTFS.aspx#CheckinRegularly "Do you make small changes and check in early and often") rule


These duties need to be taken care of on a regular basis, but most of all, the all members of the team should be encouraged to improve things themselves.
