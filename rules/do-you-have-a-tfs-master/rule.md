<ul>The best way of getting the most out of TFS is to have a 'TFS master'. A 'TFS master' is like a Scrum Master but only interested in helping you get 100% from TFS&#58; <li>Taking you beyond, TFS as a source control system </li>
<li>Getting TFS to help you on a proper ALM road </li>
<li>Make sure that Build are created and managed properly by the developers </li>
<li>Manage the Build servers (builds themselves are the responsibility of the developers) </li>
<li>Check the builds are fit for purpose, and that unit tests are included </li>
<li>Deployment is fine and working properly </li>
<li>Checking Wix files </li>
<li>Checking the right check-in policies are enabled </li>
<li>Code analysis is enabled and getting stronger </li>
<li>Code auditor is running </li>
<li>Checking the reports are looking healthy </li>
<li>Clean up unused Workspaces (this removes old check outs by default) </li>
<li>Make sure all patches are applied to the servers </li>
<li>Send out check-in warnings every week to people which have left over check outs. (No task should take longer than 8 hours) </li>
<li>etc... </li></ul>
<p>These duties need to be taken care of on a regular basis.</p>
