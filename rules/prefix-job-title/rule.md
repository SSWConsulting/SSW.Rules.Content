Consistency is the most important part of branding. It leads to familiarity which builds brand recognition. A simple and effective method is prefixing job titles everywhere they appear with the company name.

<!--endintro-->

A job title on social media or other public place should be:

* **{{ COMPANY NAME }} {{ POSITION }}**

Note #2: See: [Do you understand the value of consistency?](/the-value-of-consistency/)
