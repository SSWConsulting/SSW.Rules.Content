Consistency is the most important part of branding. It leads to familiarity which builds brand recognition. A simple and effective method is prefixing job titles everywhere they appear with the company name.

A job title on social media or other public place should be:

- **{{ COMPANY NAME }} {{ POSITION }}**
  E.g. "SSW Software Engineer"
