There is often a bit of confusion about what constitutes a brief proposal and what constitutes a specification review.  
<!--endintro-->



[Brief proposal](/Pages/BriefProposalOrSpecificationReview.aspx) - free:

* Information about your company
* A basic overview of what you'll do for them
* The next steps


[Specification Review](/rules) - billed:

* A technical document listing in detail what technologies will be used and how
* Most likely includes initial release plans and ballparks
