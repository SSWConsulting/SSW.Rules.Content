There is often a bit of confusion about what constitutes a brief proposal and what constitutes a Specification Review.  
<!--endintro-->

**Brief proposal** - free:

* Information about your company
* A basic overview of what you'll do for them
* The next steps


**Specification Review** - billed:

* A technical document listing in detail what technologies will be used and how
* Most likely includes initial release plans and ballparks
