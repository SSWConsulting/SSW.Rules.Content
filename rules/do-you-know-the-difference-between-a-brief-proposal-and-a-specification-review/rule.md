There is often a bit of confusion about what constitutes a brief proposal and what constitutes a Specification Review.

<!--endintro-->

**Brief proposal** - free:

- Information about your company
- A basic overview of what you'll do for them
- The next steps

**Specification Review** - billed:

- A technical document listing in detail what technologies will be used and how
- Most likely includes initial release plans and ballparks
