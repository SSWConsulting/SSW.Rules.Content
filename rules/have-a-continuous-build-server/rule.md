A Continuous Integration (CI) server monitors the Source Control repository and, when something changes, it will checkout, build and test the software. If something is wrong, notifications are sent out e.g. via email or Teams.

Building and testing the software on each change made to the code helps to reduce the risk of introducing unwanted changes in its functionality. The change deltas between builds are small and continuous testing results in a stable and "known good" state of the codebase.
