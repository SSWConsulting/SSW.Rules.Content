Unless you're the &lt;1% of companies who competes based purely on price, you will need to be able to explain why your services are more expensive than 1 or more of your competitors.

In the bespoke software space, this is easy, as your clients are not buying something generic, and quality matters. Here's how we do it:


<!--endintro-->

From our research, our rates are in the top 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of our Australian competitors, and I understand that this can seem high, so let's try to highlight a few reasons why we more than justify these high rates:

* Statistically, more than half of all IT projects fail
    * SSW has been around for over 25 years and has only ever had 2 failed projects
* We ensure this through the following:
    * Our Lean Startup methodologies mean we focus clearly on the [Minimum Viable Product](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=3ab40a13-29a5-4016-a2e4-8eeb9d3ccd58)
    * A strong and strict [Scrum process](https&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Scrum.aspx) gives visibility into priorities, progress, and problems to the whole team and the Product Owner
    * Our arduous [hiring process](https&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Employment/Employment.aspx) ensures we only have the most technically proficient consultants with the best communication skills
    * A strong focus on [rules and best practices](/rules-to-better-scrum-using-tfs) ensure that we are consistently delivering high-quality solutions
    * Our [community involvement](https&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Events/) (User groups, Hack Days, MS Events, etc.)  helps us to rub shoulders with the other thought leaders in our industry  and stay ahead of the game
    * Our strong [partnership with Microsoft](https&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Company/AboutUs.aspx) (our owner is 1 of only 3 Microsoft Regional Directors in Australia) makes sure we have support when we need it
