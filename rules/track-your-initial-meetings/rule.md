When creating an appointment email for an initial meeting, make sure you include the words " **initial** " and " **meeting** " on the subject.

 **Subject:**  Northwind project with SSW and Bob

::: bad
Figure: Bad subject - not clear it is an initial meeting

::: greybox
 **Subject:** <mark>Initial meeting</mark> with SSW and Bob from Northwind
**Subject:** <mark>Initial</mark> phone 
         <mark>meeting</mark> with SSW and Bob from Northwind

The Appointment should also be tracked (without regarding) in Dynamics 365 so that this information is readily available and reportable.
