Workaround - When you have two fields and you want to handle tabbing out of the last one to do some stuff and save.

* If you handle onkeydown the value isn't set yet
* If you handle onkeyup it triggers on the first field instead of the last one

<!--endintro-->

To solve the issue change the binding to `@bind:event="oninput"` so the value is captured before key down.

The reason is due to the problem outlined in [Keyup event behavior on tab](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18020098/keyup-event-behavior-on-tab).

There are various workarounds such as using eventPropagation in JavaScript: [Catching TAB key press with keyup](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37144885/catching-tab-key-press-with-keyup).

However, eventPropagation is not supported in Blazor as per [this comment on Compiler support](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/14517#issuecomment-559184498) for `@oneventname:preventDefault` and `@oneventname:stopPropagation`.

So, to prevent this issue an OnInput binding lets the value be set before the keydown event is triggered.

This workaround can cause unexpected side effects if you have a custom setter so you shouldn't do that in tandem with this.
