Don't waste time evaluating which Web UI libraries to use. Most of the commonly used libraries are very similar in functionality.  The recommended library is  **[Bootstrap](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=f02abbb2-35fb-47b3-b379-486061d69a70)** .

It's the most popular available framework today, which means more people involved in the project, more tutorials and articles from the community, more real-world examples/websites, more third-party extensions, and better integration with other web development products
