Don't waste time evaluating which Web UI (Component) libraries to use. If you're already using React, we recommend going with [shadcn/ui](https://shadcn.dev/) – as it's the most extensible and strikes a balance between flexibility and simplicity. For other environments, or for the easiest experience, go with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

<!--endintro-->

## If you want to find a better fit

First consider the import type – some component libraries use a "copy and paste" style of code sharing, while others have typical import behaviour (hiding implementation details behind their APIs). 

The latter kind are typically easier to use, but harder to extend. There's also a divide in terms of maintenance responsibility – if you paste and modify code into your project, you'll have update code to newer versions yourself. 

Typical imports may be upgraded and maintained by the community, but you have to be conscious of any API changes.

When evaluating a component library, also keep in mind:
- **Community Support**: Does it have an active user base, comprehensive documentation, and external resources like tutorials and plugins?
- **Integration**: How well does it work with your current tech stack (e.g., React, Angular, Vue)?
- **Performance**: Does it maintain fast load times and responsiveness, even with complex components?

## (Recommended approach) shadcn/ui – customised with V0

shadcn/ui is an excellent choice for React developers looking for a library that is both customizable and pre-built.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines the benefits of a traditional UI library with flexibility, letting you customize components without being locked into specific styles or functionality.
- **Modern Design System**: Comes with clean, accessible, and responsive components that follow modern design principles.

## Bootstrap (recommended for ease of use)

Bootstrap has been the go-to general-purpose component library for years.
- **Wide Adoption**: It’s the most popular library, meaning more community support, tutorials, third-party plugins, and better integration.
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works seamlessly with JS, Angular, React, Vue, or even pure HTML/CSS.
- **Optimized Ports**: Specialized ports exist for frameworks like [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/).

While Bootstrap is a safe and reliable choice, it does have drawbacks, such as limited customizability and heavy reliance on CSS overrides to achieve bespoke designs.

### Other Useful Frameworks

Once you’ve saved time by using a pre-built UI library, explore these additional frameworks to enhance your web app:
- **[KendoUI](http://www.kendoui.com/)**: Offers advanced HTML and jQuery controls for data grids, charts, and more.
- **[SignalR](http://signalr.net/)**: Provides real-time web functionality, perfect for apps needing live updates (e.g., chat apps, dashboards).
