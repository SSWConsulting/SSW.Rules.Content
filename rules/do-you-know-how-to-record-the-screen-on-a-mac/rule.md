If you don't have [Camtasia](/production-do-you-know-how-to-start-recording-with-camtasia) or ScreenFlow, you can use the built-in Mac functionalities to record the screen on Mac OS.

<!--endintro-->

You have 2 options:

- [How to record the screen on your Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT208721) (recommended)
- [Record your screen in QuickTime Player on Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/quicktime-player/qtp97b08e666/mac)

**Tip:** Alternatively, you can use [Loom](https://www.useloom.com), which works as a Google Chrome extension.
