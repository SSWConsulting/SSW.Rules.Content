<p>
                    When a user downloads a file from your site, they should see a progress bar along with
                    the total size and estimated time, this way they will see the size of the download
                    increasing and will knowing when it will finish.​​</p>

                        Figure&#58; Bad example - there is no indication of the total size of the download or
                        the percent complete, thus no estimate of how long left</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt>

                        Figure&#58; Good example - percent complete, time left, total size and a progress bar
                        are all shown</dd></dl>
