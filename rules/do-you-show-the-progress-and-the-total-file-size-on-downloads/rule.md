<span class='intro'> <p>
                    When a user downloads a file from your site, they should see a progress bar along with
                    the total size and estimated time, this way they will see the size of the download
                    increasing and will knowing when it will finish.​​</p> </span>

<dl class="badImage"><dt>
                        <img src="bar-progress-bad.jpg" alt="image showing download with no progress" /></dt><dd>
                        Figure&#58; Bad example - there is no indication of the total size of the download or
                        the percent complete, thus no estimate of how long left</dd></dl><dl class="goodImage"><dt>
                        <img src="bar-progress-good.jpg" alt="image showing download with progress, size, percent complete, etc" /></dt><dd>
                        Figure&#58; Good example - percent complete, time left, total size and a progress bar
                        are all shown</dd></dl>
