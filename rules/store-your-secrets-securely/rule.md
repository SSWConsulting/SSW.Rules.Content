Most systems will have variables that need to be stored securely; OpenId shared secret keys, connection strings, and API tokens to name a few.

These secrets  **must not** be stored in source control in plain text – it is insecure by nature, and basically means that it is sitting.

<!--endintro-->

There are many options for managing secrets in a secure way:

### Bad Practices



::: greybox

### Store production passwords in source control protected with the 
      [ASP.NET IIS Registration Tool](https&#58;//msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zhhddkxy.aspx)

Pros:

* Minimal change to existing process – no need for 
         [DPAPI](https&#58;//msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms995355.aspx)or a dedicated Release Management (RM) tool.
* Simple and easy to understand


Cons:

* Need to manually give the app pool identity ability to read the default RSA key container.
* Difficult to manage production and non-production config settings
* Developers can easily decrypt and access the production password.
* Manual transmission of the password from the key store to the encrypted config file.

### Use Windows Identity instead of username/ password.

Pros:

* Minimal change to existing process – no need for DPAPI or a dedicated RM tool.
* Simple and easy to understand


Cons:

* Difficult to manage production and non-production config settings
* Not generally applicable to all secured resources.
* Can hit firewall snags with Kerberos and AD ports
* Vulnerable to DOS attacks related to password lockout policies
* Has key-person reliance on network admin

### [Use External Configuration Files](https&#58;//docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/identity/overview/features-api/best-practices-for-deploying-passwords-and-other-sensitive-data-to-aspnet-and-azure)


Pros:

* Simple to understand and implement


Cons:

* Makes setting up projects the first time very hard.
* Easy to accidentally check the external config file into source control.
* Still need DPAPI to protect the external config file.
* No clear way to manage the DevOps process for external config files.

### Good Practices


::: greybox

### Use Octopus/ VSTS RM secret management, with passwords sourced from KeePass


Pros:

* Scalable and secure.
* General industry best practice - great for organizations of most sizes below large corporate.


Cons:

* Password reset process is still manual
* DPAPI still needed.

### Use Enterprise Secret Management Tool – LastPass/ Hashicorp Vault/ etc..

Pros:

* Enterprise grade – supports cryptographically strong passwords, auditing of secret access and dynamic secrets
* Supports hierarchy of secrets
* API interface for interfacing with other tools.
* Password transmission can be done without a human in the chain.


Cons:

* More complex to install and administer
* DPAPI still needed for config files at rest

### Use Azure KeyVault

See the SSW Rewards mobile app repository for how SSW is using this in a production application:           [https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Rewards](https&#58;//github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Rewards)

Pros:

* Best solution for cloud (Azure) solutions
* Enterprise grade
* Uses industry standard best encryption
* Dynamically cycles secrets
* Access granted based on Azure AD permissions - no need to 'securely' share passwords with colleagues
* Can be used to inject secrets in your CI/CD pipelines for non-cloud solutions




Cons:

* Price is per transaction - can become costly if used in high volume and not managed thoroughly (see SSW's William Liebenberg on Azure SpendOps: 
            [https://azuregems.io/spendops-with-azure-cosmos-db/](https&#58;//azuregems.io/spendops-with-azure-cosmos-db/)
