There are several ways you can set up your boardroom AV for effective and efficient conferencing. The **best and recommended solution today is Microsoft Teams Rooms with a Logitech setup**.  

<!--endintro-->

## Microsoft Teams Rooms (Recommended)

The easiest and most reliable way to run hybrid meetings is to use a **Teams-certified Logitech bundle**.\
This includes the camera, microphones, speakers, and a Teams Room console – all purpose-built for different room sizes (Huddle, Medium, or Boardroom).

**✅ Pros:**

* One-touch join from the Teams Room console – no cable chaos
* Seamless integration with Microsoft 365 and Outlook
* Logitech hardware bundles are designed for Teams, providing excellent camera and audio quality
* IT-friendly – secure, managed, and built for corporate networking
* Works with both internal staff and guests (via Teams invites)
* Can still present wired (HDMI) or wirelessly using **Logitech Swytch**

**❌ Cons:**

* Higher upfront cost compared to consumer solutions
* Tied to Microsoft Teams (limited if your company standardises on other platforms)

## Apple TV

A popular way to connect devices wirelessly to the boardroom TV is to use an Apple TV.

**✅ Pros:**

* It allows you to connect any Apple device including iOS.
* Easy to use for Apple users
* Can be easily added to an AV automation system, e.g. Control4, Savant, etc. which allows you to display on any other display connected to the same AV system
* Inexpensive way of adding wireless connectivity to an existing system

**❌ Cons:**

* Only works with Apple devices
* Not designed for corporate networking (can’t have both guest access and secured network at the same time)
* Guest need to be on a corporate network to connect

## Smart TV’s with built-in AirPlay, Google Cast and Miracast

A newer way to connect wirelessly is to use Smart TV’s built-in features.

For a more robust AV solution, you can install an Extron system. We recommend the ShareLink Pro.

## Barco Clickshare

A more advanced wireless solution, Barco Clickshare allows you to use any laptop device without installing software by connecting a small USB dongle. The Clickshare 'brain' is connected to your TV or AV hub via HDMI.
