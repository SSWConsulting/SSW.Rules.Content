There are several ways you can set up your boardroom AV for effective and efficient conferencing.

### Apple TV

A popular way to connect devices wirelessly to the boardroom TV is to use an Apple TV.

### Smart TV’s with built-in AirPlay, Google and HoMirrorcast

### Barco Clickshare

A more advanced wireless solution, Barco Clickshare allows you to use any laptop device without installing software by connecting a small USB dongle. The Clickshare 'brain' is connected to your TV or AV hub via HDMI.
