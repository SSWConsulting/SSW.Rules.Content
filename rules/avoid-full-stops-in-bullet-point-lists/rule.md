Excess punctuation without a purpose can make a document or web page look overly busy. For a list of  **short sentences**  and for  **figure captions** , don't add full stops at the end. The exception to this rule is when you have more than one sentence, then only avoid the full stop in the  **last sentence** .

<!--endintro-->

For example:


::: greybox

* Sentence 1.
* Sentence 2.
* Sentence 3.


:::


::: bad
Figure: Bad Example - Too much punctuation  
:::



::: greybox

* Sentence 1
* Sentence 2. Sentence 3
* Sentence 4


:::


::: good
Figure: Good Example - Full stop is only used in the bullet point that has multiple sentences, except in the last one
