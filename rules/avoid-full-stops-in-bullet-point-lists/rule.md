Excess punctuation without a purpose can make a document or web page look overly busy. This can add a surprising amount of visual clutter. 

For **lists of short sentences** and **figure captions**, don'tÂ add full stops at the end. Of course when you have more than one sentence, add the full stops where necessary, then only avoid the full stop in the **last sentence**.
