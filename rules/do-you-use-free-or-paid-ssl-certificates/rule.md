What is the best option for your business when it comes to securing your website with HTTPS?

<!--endintro-->

When you create a website, you can only access it through **HTTP** (http://), and not securely through **HTTPS** (https://) if you do not own an SSL Certificate.

When it comes to website certificates, you can choose from free or paid SSL certificates!

**Free certificates** can be obtained from Certificate Authorities like Let's Encrypt, which is helping provide free and automated certificates for the web.

Free certificates:
- provide the same level of SSL encryption as paid certificates;
- provide HTTPS with a green padlock on the address bar of your browser, just like paid certificates;
- can be automatically renewed, easily.

Why would anyone use **paid certificates**, then?

If you are operating a big business, paid certificates give you some more assurances over free ones, and you can obtain them through reputable Certificate Authorities like Comodo, GeoTrust, Symantec, etc:

Paid certificates:
- gives you warranty against misuse or wrongly issued certificates;
- are normally valid for at least 1 year or more, while free certificates are only valid for 3 months;
- offer support for any errors or problems you have with your certificates.

SSL Certificates are an important part of any reputable website, so if you are operating a small website, blog, testing environment, personal site, anything that doesn't need too much support, getting a free certificate is the way to go.

If your business or site does not fit on the above affirmation, getting a paid certificate is the best option!
