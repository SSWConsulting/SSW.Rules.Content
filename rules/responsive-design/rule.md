Are you ensuring your websites and apps are responsive, or mobile-friendly? While you might have a high-resolution monitor at your workstation, it's crucial to remember that many users access content through their mobile phones or tablets.

Your goal should be to create designs that seamlessly adapt to various screen sizes, from small mobile displays to large desktop monitors.
