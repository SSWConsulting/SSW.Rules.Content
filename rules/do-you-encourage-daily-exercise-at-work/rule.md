<span class='intro'> A healthy team is more energized​, happy, and productive, and a culture to encourage this should&#160;come from the top.<br> </span>

<p>Every company should allocate 15-20 minutes per day to getting their employees up and moving. It could be planking, pushups, or even just a fast walk, but the benefits will be worth it.&#160;</p><p>The best time for this is generally just before lunch, so as not to be too disruptive. It's a good idea to allocate an Exercise Master to help initiate this and encourage people to join.&#160;<br></p><p>If it really takes off, potentially get some basic equipment in like kettlebells or yoga mats, to give people more options.<br></p>
