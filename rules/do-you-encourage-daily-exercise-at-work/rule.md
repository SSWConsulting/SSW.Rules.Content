A healthy team is more energized, happy, and productive, and a culture to encourage this should come from the top.

Research has increasingly linked sedentary behaviour to negative health outcomes, both physically and cognitively.

[According to researches](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7700832), around one-third of the global population over 15 years old does insufficient physical activity, contributing to health risks, while sedentary lifestyles—averaging 7.7 to 8.3 hours daily—spread due to factors like office work and screen time, leading to metabolic, cardiovascular, and cognitive issues. Reducing sedentary behaviour and increasing physical activity are crucial to mitigating these risks, including obesity, diabetes, cancer, and mental health disorders.

[Another study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17518420801997007), among many others, demonstrated that regular physical activity significantly reduces the risk of subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and related functional limitations, with active adults showing lower prevalence rates (8.8%) compared to inactive individuals (15.7%), emphasizing its protective role in maintaining cognitive health.

It should come as no surprise that an increase in brain health is linked to better performance on complex tasks.

According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/workplacehealthpromotion/initiatives/resource-center/case-studies/index.html), physical activity at work is one of the most cost-effective ways to improve employee health and reduce absenteeism.

### Set the standard from the top

Every company should allocate 15-20 minutes per day to getting their employees up and moving. It could be planking, pushups, or even just a fast walk, preferably outdoors to soak in some natural sunlight for a [healthy dose of Vitamin D](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/vitamin-d), while being mindful of sun safety practices.

The best time for this is generally just before lunch, so as not to be too disruptive. It's a good idea to allocate an Exercise Master to help initiate this and encourage people to join.

If it really takes off, potentially get some basic equipment in like kettlebells or yoga mats, to give people more options.

### Turn fitness into numbers

What's more of an accomplishment - 'I ran for 30 minutes', or 'I did a 5k in 20 minutes'?

For most people, the latter is better because it has a specific definition, and has a metric to improve.

Once you have an appropriate tool - e.g. fitness band, smartphone, fitness ring - you can get a similar target with steps/day (e.g. 5,000) that you can measure yourself and push against.


### Have a company program to get a **fitness band**

* 

* Use a **mobile app** to:
  * Track steps and heart rate
  * Create weekly team challenges
  * Share leaderboards or step goals in Teams channels

### 🏃‍♂️‍➡️ Make it simple

All it takes is 20 minutes a day. Here are some practical ways to make it happen:

* Quick activities like:
  * Planking
  * Push-ups
  * Light stretching or yoga
  * Brisk walking outdoors (bonus: natural sunlight = Vitamin D)
* Consider doing this just before lunch for minimal disruption.
* Assign an **Exercise Master** to initiate the sessions and rally participation.

At SSW, the team stops around 11:45 am for group planks, push-ups, or outdoor walks. It's a fun, regular part of the culture.

### 🏋️‍♂️ Moving in the office

Encourage fun habits around the office:
Studies show that 5 minute breaks every 30 mins increase productivity (see https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/pomodoro)

* 10 pushups for saying a swear word 🤬
* Friendly pull-up competitions
* A set of free weights in the office
* Standing desks so employees can alternate posture
* Take walking meetings when discussing non-technical topics

Even small efforts can improve circulation and mental sharpness before going into focused work.

### 🥇 Reward consistency and track it in reviews

Build a long-term culture of health by recognizing ongoing effort:

* At annual reviews, record each person's **average daily steps** as part of their personal goals and KPIs.
* Reward those who hit their monthly movement targets with small perks.

This adds accountability and reinforces that physical wellbeing is valued just as much as professional output.
