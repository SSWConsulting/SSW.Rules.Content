A healthy team is more energized, happy, and productive, and a culture to encourage this shouldÂ come from the top.

<!--endintro-->

Every company should allocate 15-20 minutes per day to getting their employees up and moving. It could be planking, pushups, or even just a fast walk, preferably outdoors to soak in some natural sunlight for a [healthy dose of Vitamin D](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/vitamin-d), while being mindful of sun safety practices.

The best time for this is generally just before lunch, so as not to be too disruptive. It's a good idea to allocate an Exercise Master to help initiate this and encourage people to join.

If it really takes off, potentially get some basic equipment in like kettlebells or yoga mats, to give people more options.
