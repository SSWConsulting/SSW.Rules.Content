It is essential that a company keeps a record of how much time its employees are spending on billable and non-billable work. This helps at invoicing time, and to make sure the clients see exactly where their time and money is being spent. One of the primary responsibilities as a developer is to complete timesheets. See [Rules to better timesheets](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterTimesheets.aspx) for more.
