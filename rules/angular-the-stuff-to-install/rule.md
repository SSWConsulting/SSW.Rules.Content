If you want to get started with Angular, the Angular Setup guide can be found at https://angular.io/guide/setup-local.  

The prerequisites are:

1. **Node.js** (https://nodejs.org/) and  **NPM** (installed with Node.Js by default) (https://www.npmjs.com/)
2. **Angular CLI** (https://angular.io/cli)

The best practice for creating an Angular project and components is to use the [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) (command-line interface).

The Angular CLI is also used in the latest .NET Angular SPA template. 
Read [Do you know that the ASP.NET Core SPA Template for Angular uses the Angular CLI?](/asp-net-core-spa-template-for-angular-uses-the-angular-cli)

Instructions for upgrading the Angular CLI of an existing project can be found here: [https://update.angular.io](https://update.angular.io/)

### Getting errors?
