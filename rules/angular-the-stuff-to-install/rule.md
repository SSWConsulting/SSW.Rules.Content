If you want to get started with Angular, the Angular Setup guide can be found at https://angular.io/guide/setup-local.  

The prerequisites are:

1. **Node.js** (https://nodejs.org/) and  **NPM** (installed with Node.Js by default) (https://www.npmjs.com/)
2. **Angular CLI** (https://angular.io/cli)

The best practice for creating an Angular project and components is to use the [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) (command-line interface).

The Angular CLI is also used in the latest .NET Angular SPA template. 
Read [Do you know that the ASP.NET Core SPA Template for Angular uses the Angular CLI?](/asp-net-core-spa-template-for-angular-uses-the-angular-cli)

<!--endintro-->

Instructions for upgrading the Angular CLI of an existing project can be found here: [https://update.angular.io](https://update.angular.io/)

### Getting errors?

If you get node gyp errors, follow instructions here: https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp

If you get permission errors, follow instructions here: https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions

### Which IDE should I use for developing Angular applications?

We recommend you use  **VSCode** - [http://code.visualstudio.com](http://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Other tools to consider

In addition to the essential tools mentioned, there are several other useful browser extensions that can improve your development experience:



1. **Angular DevTools** (https://angular.io/guide/devtools) for Angular 12+ applications.


Angular DevTools helps to debug and profile Angular applications by visualizing the component structure, inspecting component properties, inputs, and outputs and running a performance profiler.

2. **Redux DevTools** (https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools/) when using state management libraries like NgRx or NgXs.



Redux DevTools allows for inspection, monitoring, and manipulation of the state of an Angular application.
