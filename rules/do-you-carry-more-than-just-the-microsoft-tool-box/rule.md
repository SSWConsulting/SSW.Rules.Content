A spanner might get a plumber through 90% of jobs, but he'll get stuck on the last 10% if he doesn't carry anything else.<br>
Microsoft tools are the most important tools&#160;we have, but they only cover the first 90%. I spend most of my time using Outlook, Visual Studio .NET, SQL Server Management Studio. However Microsoft tools don'​t do everything. Rather than spending our time recreating the wheel, we should always look out for non-Microsoft options or extensions that will save me time.

We have
