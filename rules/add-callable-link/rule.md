When adding a 'call-able' link to your website, it is best practice to:

* [**Use International Format**](/right-format-to-show-phone-numbers): Ensure the phone number is in international format to avoid issues with country codes
* **Ensure the 'Call-able' Link is Visible and Accessible**: Place the 'call-able' link in prominent locations on your website such as the header, footer, or contact page
* **Test on Multiple Devices**: Verify that the link works on various devices and browsers to ensure universal accessibility
