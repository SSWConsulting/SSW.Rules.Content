## Lowered Artwork Costs

AI-generated images are drastically lowering the costs. No longer do you need to spend a fortune on artwork commissions, or purchase costly stock images. With AI, you have a tool at your disposal that can generate stunning visuals in no time at all, and at a fraction of the traditional cost.

## Rapid Artistic Experimentation

AI also enables rapid experimentation. With traditional artwork, each iteration can take hours, days, or even weeks. With AI, you can experiment with different styles, color palettes, and concepts almost instantaneously, improving your chances of discovering something inspiring or creating a piece that perfectly suits your needs.
