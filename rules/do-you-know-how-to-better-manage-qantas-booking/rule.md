SSW encourage our staff to book their flights on Qantas because of its safety, reliability, environmental sustainability and reputation.

Qantas offers a robust loyalty program, which can provide benefits to both the individual traveler and the company. Companies can accumulate points and rewards through the program that can be used to offset future travel expenses.

* All flights booked by the company can be managed through Qantas Business Rewards https://www.qantas.com/au/en/business-rewards/qbr/myaccount
* There is a monthly report which can be downloaded via https://www.qantas.com/au/en/business-rewards/qbr/reports

**Note**: As the passenger, you are responsible for forwarding the booking confirmation and tax invoice to SSWAccounts as per https://my.sugarlearning.com/SSW/items/9380/

If an invoice is missing, admins can access the document, as follows:

1. Go to Qantas Business Rewards | Manage Booking | Request tax invoice.
2. Select "e-Ticket" and enter the booking reference (which can be found on monthly reports or confirmation emails).
3. Tax invoice will be sent to the email you enter.
