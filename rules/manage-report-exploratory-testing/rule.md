Exploratory Testing (ET) gives the tester much more freedom and responsibility in their testing than when following a more scripted approach. 

Putting some structure around ET helps to make the approach more credible and provides a way for managers to track and review testers' work.

Session-based test management (SBTM) is a lightweight approach to the management of exploratory testing effort that defines a set of expectations for what kind of work will be done and how it will be reported. 

>[SBTM is] a way for the testers to make orderly reports and organize their work without obstructing the flexibility and serendipity that makes exploratory testing useful
