Azure cost analysis gives you a detailed breakdown of where any Azure spending is coming from. It tells you costing by: 

* Scoped Area e.g. a subscription 
* Resource Group e.g. Northwind.Website
* Location e.g. Australia East
* Service type e.g. Azure App Service
Note: You can also 'filter by' any of these things to give you a narrowed down view

## Analysing the big dog spenders 

To optimize spending, analyze major costs in each category. Focus on top three contributors - optimizing beyond that may not be worth the effort. 

Key questions to ask:

* Can you scale down? 
* Did you need it in the first place? 
* Can you refactor your application to consume less? 
* Can you change the type of service or consumption model?

## Scoped Area

## Resource Group 

## Location 

## Service type 




Here are some tips for doing that:

* Utilize the Azure Cost Analysis tool to view your spending trends and identify areas where you can reduce costs. 
* Use the resource groups breakdown and the cost by resource feature to get an itemized list of your spending.

Keep in mind that it's usually not worth analyzing resources beyond the top three cost contributors, as the effort to optimize them may outweigh the potential savings. Take advantage of these tips to save significant amounts of money on your Azure costs.
