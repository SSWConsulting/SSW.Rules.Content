To avoid overspending on Azure, it is important to regularly monitor and analyze your costs:

* Utilize the Azure Cost Analysis tool to view your spending trends and identify areas where you can reduce costs. 
* Use the resource groups breakdown and the cost by resource feature to get an itemized list of your spending.
          

Keep in mind that it's usually not worth analyzing resources beyond the top three cost contributors, as the effort to optimize them may outweigh the potential savings. Take advantage of these tips to save significant amounts of money on your Azure costs.
