<span class='intro'> <p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">There are so many ways to spend you Marketing Budget these days&#160;that&#160;it's&#160;tempting to do a lot ofdifferent&#160;things and spread your budget&#160;quite&#160;thin across many platforms.&#160;In our experience, our budget has&#160;always&#160;been better spent by picking a few things and&#160;then&#160;doing them&#160;really well.&#160;For example, we know&#160;that&#160;for us, Twitter is great for branding, but not as great at selling our&#160;Events or Services.&#160;So&#160;counter this, we do great free social media posts&#160;on Twitter and&#160;occasionally&#160;spend on targeted ads&#160;(to expand our brand), but spend&#160;more&#160;money on Facebook Ads&#160;to advertise our&#160;<a href="https&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Events/Training/NET-Core-Superpowers-Tour.aspx">Training Events</a>, because we know&#160;that&#160;our audience uses&#160;this platform&#160;the most for purchases.​​​<br></p> </span>

<p>​Deciding about where to place your budget can be quite confusing, but&#160;if you’ve done your&#160;homework&#160;and identified your&#160;potential client&#160;through&#160;personas, you can work out which platforms to&#160;target&#160;to hit&#160;your audience.&#160;&#160;<br>Using your persons to target your audience will save you a lot of money in the long run,&#160;because while&#160;you’re&#160;not excluding anyone from outside&#160;of&#160;your target&#160;audience, you are&#160;honing in on someone most likely to purchase&#160;your product or service.&#160;<br>&#160;<br>For example, your cost can depend on how wide your audience is if it’s local or international, and more. These details will make it possible to find the right number to align your budget with your marketing goals. Staying focused on your marketing objectives is also part of not overcoming your budget. As an example, new companies invest an average of 12 to 20% on the marketing of gross revenue, while established companies will spend between 6 to 12% of their gross revenue.&#160;<br> &#160;<br>Here are some interesting demographics to consider&#58;&#160;​<br></p><dl class="image"><dt>

LinkedIn remains consistently dominant in the trust rankings and is still growing in size every day.​<br></p>
