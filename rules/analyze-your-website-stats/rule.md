There is a lot of information tucked away in your web server log files. Valuable, but often unused, information that can be retrieved from your web server log files include:

* Geographical origin of users
* Referring pages (which external pages did the users come from e.g. search engines)
* Number of users
* Time spent on the website
* Reasons for user's early departure
* Popularity of pages within your website
