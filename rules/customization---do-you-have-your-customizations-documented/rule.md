<span class='intro'> <p>
          You will want to have a list of all customizations - from Custom Entities to Callouts.
          You can export the customizations to an XML file - but that is not fun to read.
          There is no tool to document or any visual tool to look at - so the best thing is
          screen captures with circles highlighting the customized areas.
