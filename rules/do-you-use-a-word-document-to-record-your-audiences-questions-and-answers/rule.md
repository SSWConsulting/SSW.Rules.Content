  <p>It is a good idea to have some interaction with your audience in the form of Q&amp;A. This will instill a lasting message long after your presentation is over.</p>
<p>By opening a word document on the screen or projector, everyone in the room will be clear about the questions being asked and the answers being given. This will also help you address any open issues after the presentation. </p>
