Facebook has a call-to-action feature that helps Pages drive business objectives. These call-to-action buttons link to any destination on or off Facebook that aligns with a businessâ€™s goals.

Page admins can select from a group of call-to-action buttons:



* Book Now
* Contact Us
* Use App
* Play Game
* Shop Now
* Sign Up
* Watch Video




<!--endintro-->

For services or apps, you should use the "Watch Video" one. Video is flooding the online marketplace and is quickly becoming a marketing standard to convey your message. If you don't have a video yet, visit 
      [SSW's Video Services pages](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Video-Production/) to make a creative and engaging video for your company.
