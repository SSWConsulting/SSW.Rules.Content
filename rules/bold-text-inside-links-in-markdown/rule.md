When making a link bold in Markdown, the position of the bold formatting matters. Even though both approaches render visually similar, only one preserves proper semantics, accessibility, and consistent styling.

<!--endintro-->
  
## ❌ Avoid wrapping the link with bold formatting

::: greybox
Markdown example: 
``` md
**[Read more about our pricing](/pricing)**
```
This results in less ideal HTML:

``` html
<strong><a href="/pricing">Read more about our pricing</a></strong>
````
:::
::: bad
Figure: Bad example - While it may look the same, the bold is no longer part of the link element, which can cause inconsistencies and reduces semantic clarity
:::

## ✅ Place the bold formatting inside the link syntax

This ensures:

* The entire link is both bold and clickable
* Correct semantic HTML structure
* Better accessibility for screen readers
* Predictable styling across Markdown renderers

::: greybox
Markdown example: 
``` md
[**Read more about our pricing**](/pricing)
```
HTML output:

``` html
<a href="/pricing"><strong>Read more about our pricing</strong></a>
````
:::
::: good
Figure: Good example - Cleaner HTML, better accessibility, and more consistent styling across your design system

If text is both bold and a link, the bold should live inside the link syntax, not the other way around.
