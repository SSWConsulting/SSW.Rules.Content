Setting up a WordPress site hosted on Windows Azure is easy and free, but you only get 20Mb of MySql data on the free plan.

![Figure: If you are serious about your blog and including content on it, you should configure a paid Azure Add-on to host your MySQL Database when you set it up](wp-db-azure2.jpg)
