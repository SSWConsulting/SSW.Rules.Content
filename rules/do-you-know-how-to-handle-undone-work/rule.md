<span class='intro'> <p class="p1">The goal is always to complete PBIs for the Sprint Review.</p><p class="p1">Often PBIs grow or change and it does not make sense to deliver what was originally proposed in the Acceptance Criteria.</p> </span>

<p>So think of a way to deliver business value and get it in production, then have a hallway conversation with the Product Owner to see if he agrees with you.</p><p>Assuming approval, then adjust some of the Acceptance Criteria, add &quot;v1&quot; to the PBI name and move some of the functionality to a new PBI with the same title and &quot;v2&quot;.â€‹</p><p>Eg.</p><ul><li>Customer and Contact Form v1</li><li>Customer and Contact Form v2</li></ul><dl class="image"><dt>
