Twitter lets anyone request a verified account (the blue tick goes public). Twitter says that an account will be verified if it is deemed of being of public interest.

<!--endintro-->

As outlined on the Twitter website:

### Request to verify an account
The blue verified badge on Twitter lets people know that an account of public interest is authentic. 

We approve account types maintained by users in  **music, acting, fashion, government, politics, religion, journalism, media, sports, business, and other key interest areas** . If you believe your account is of public interest and should be verified, this article outlines information about submitting a request.


### Submitting a request

To be able to complete the form, your account must have the following:

* A verified phone number
* A confirmed email address
* A bio
* A profile photo
* A header photo
* A birthday (for accounts that are not company, brand, or organization accounts)
* A website
* Tweets set as public in Tweet privacy settings
* Profile and account recommendations

Some common characteristics of verified accounts include:



* If the account belongs to a person, the name reflects the real or stage name of the person.
* If the account is a corporation or company account, the name reflects the real name of the corporation or company.
* The profile and/or header photo reflects the person, the corporation’s branding, or the company’s branding.
* If the account is a corporate or company account, the email address associated with the account is a corporate or company email address.
