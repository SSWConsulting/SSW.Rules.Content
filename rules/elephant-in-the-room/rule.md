Sometimes, meetings can drag on while everyone tiptoes around an obvious problem, like a missed deadline, an unspoken conflict, or a broken feature. This is common in teams who don't trust each other or don't know the value of healthy conflict.

When teams avoid naming the elephant, trust fades and projects drift. Talking about it early, calmly, and clearly turns awkward silence into progress.

Here's how to structure it:

1. **Say what you see** (brief, neutral, specific).
2. **State the impact** (on goals, customers, dates, money).
3. **Invite perspectives** (assume you might be missing something).
4. **Propose next steps** (owner, action, date).
5. **Write it down** (minutes, email, work item).

## When to use it

Use this rule any time the room feels tense and no one is saying why. Maybe a project is clearly off-track, but the updates skip over it, or feedback is being hinted at rather than spoken plainly. Sometimes the real issue is a risky assumption no one has challenged, or a key person is missing and decisions keep stalling. If it feels like everyone is thinking the same thing but avoiding it, it’s time to name the elephant.

### Example 1 – Client delivery slip

“We're working hard. Let’s park timelines for now.”

Figure: Bad example - Client loses trust; slip becomes a surprise

::: greybox
“We're trending two weeks late because of the API blocker. That risks the launch event on Nov 15th.

I see a few options:

A. remove SSO from MVP\
B. add Thom full-time for 10 days\
C. move launch to 29 Nov

Which do you prefer?”

### Example 2 – Internal performance issue

::: greybox
“Let’s focus on positives today.”

::: bad
Figure: Bad example - Issue festers; team gossips instead of fixes

::: greybox
“Let’s talk about the elephant: our PR review turnaround has averaged 3 days. That’s stalling the team. Can we agree on a 24-hour SLA and a backup reviewer?”
