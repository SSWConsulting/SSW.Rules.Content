AI image generation is a rapidly evolving field that offers a novel way to produce images. This rule discusses different AI image generators and what we can use AI images for. 

<!--endintro-->

# Prompting basics: 

Prompts are the instructions that you input. They can be as simple or as complex as you like. A general prompt might look like "generate an image of a sunset over the ocean," which tells the AI exactly what you're looking for. A well-structured prompt often has the format:  

“A [type of picture] of a [main subject], [style cues].” 

You can add more detail to make a more effective prompt by following this template:

# Negative Prompting 

Negative prompting is specifying what you don't want in your image. It can be an effective way of guiding the AI away from certain features that you're not interested in. Some AI image generators (e.g. Midjourney and Dreamstudio) have this option. In others (e.g. DALLE-2), you can include it in your prompt. 

# Parameters 

Parameters allow you to control different aspects of the generated image via settings on the image generator. They can significantly affect the result. 

* Resolution: This defines the quality of the generated image. Higher resolution values will result in higher-quality images. 

* Randomness: This parameter influences the amount of random variation in the generated image. Higher randomness values may result in more unique or creative images, but they can also lead to images that deviate more from the initial prompt. 

* Aspect Ratio: Aspect ratio dictates the proportions of the image. For instance, you might choose a square (1:1) aspect ratio for social media posts, a landscape (16:9) ratio for video thumbnails, or a portrait (3:4) ratio for smartphone screens. 

* Style: Style refers to specifying a particular visual style for the image. This could be a certain artistic style (like "impressionistic" or "cubist"). The AI uses this information to guide the stylistic aspects of image generation. 

**Important:** The key to successful prompting in any AI image generator is to give a detailed prompt with descriptive wording. However, prompts should not be unnecessarily long.

“A snowy mountain landscape at sunset: majestic peaks adorned with glistening snow, bathed in warm hues, creating an ethereal and serene atmosphere. The scene evokes awe as untouched slopes and frozen trees blend with the fading light, leaving an indelible impression of nature's grandeur. Two travelers cross a footbridge over a small creek in the foreground.”

# What are the top AI image generators? 

As of now, the top contenders are DALL-E 2, Midjourney, and DreamStudio. Each of these has features that make them stand out.  

**DALL-E 2** is an AI system capable of creating realistic images from a natural language description. You can use it here: [DALL-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2)

* Has a free trial  

* Upload feature - creates different variations of an existing image

**Midjourney** is used on Discord, where users interact with the Midjourney bot by typing /imagine. You can use it here: [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home/) (you need [Discord](https://discord.com/) first) 

* Cost: $8USD/month 

* Images can be reiterated on 

* Many parameters: [Midjourney Parameter List](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/parameter-list) e.g. “--aspect” 

* Prompting: 

  * Even short prompts can produce beautiful images 

  * Basic - /imagine cat 

  * Specify an artistic medium – /imagine \<any art style\> style cat 

  * Get specific – /imagine \<style\> sketch of a cat 

  * Time travel – /imagine \<decade\> cat illustration 

  * Emote – /imagine \<emotion\> cat 

  * Be colorful – /imagine \<color word\> colored cat 

  * Explore environments – /imagine \<location\> cat

**DreamStudio** is made by StabilityAI and is used, like DALLE2, on a web interface. It is based on the Stable Diffusion process of image generation. You can use it here: [DreamStudio](https://beta.dreamstudio.ai/dream) 

* Has a free trial 

* Upload feature - creates different variations of an existing image 

* Allows easy customization of parameters (e.g., style, aspect ratio)

# Where should you use AI-generated images? 

 
✅ Use for: 

* Content Creation: AI-generated images can be used for content creation in blogs, websites, magazines, and social media posts. They can help fill gaps where stock images or professional photography might be expensive or unavailable. 

* Concept Art and Design: Artists and designers can use AI to generate concept art or design ideas, helping them visualize and brainstorm more effectively. 

* Education: In an educational context, AI can be used to create images that help illustrate complex concepts. 

* Communication: In an increasingly digital world, AI-generated images are a fun and interesting way to supplement your communications. Communicating with friends and colleagues is a great opportunity to experiment. 

 

❌ Don’t use for: 

* Misrepresentation: Using AI-generated images to represent real people or events can be misleading or deceptive, especially in news reporting or historical documentation. 

* Unfair Competition: In specific industries such as professional photography, overuse of AI-generated images could potentially devalue human artists' work, leading to unfair competition. 

* Client-Facing Material: For client-facing content, it's best to avoid AI-generated images. Using AI-generated images instead of real photos or graphics may come across as inauthentic, potentially undermining trust and with a client. 

It can be very fun to generate AI images, and so we must be careful not to overuse them. They should not be used in contexts where they might detract from the professionalism of your work or cause confusion.  

Generally, you can consider using AI-generated images in the same contexts where you would typically use a stock image – but avoid this in situations where it’s important to remain professional. Remember, the key is to use AI image generators as tools to enhance your content, not to overshadow it.
