All through main Microsoft software, you will see a variety of icons 		used to represent the information they are related to, and to make the 		interface more interesting and appealing. When are 		developing forms in Access, you should aim to make it look and feel 		consistent and user-friendly, just like Microsoft does.  
<!--endintro-->

Find a library you like from one of the links at [Do you know where you can find some nice icons?](/where-to-find-nice-icons) and use it consistently over your forms. See some [examples](/use-clean-designs-when-creating-forms) of how we used these icons to vastly improve an old and stuffy Access UI.
