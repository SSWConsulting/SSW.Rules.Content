**Notes:**
- Some travel companies, such as FlightCentre, are able to match or beat the prices quoted by their competitors so be sure to ask them for a competitive fare
-	Make sure that before comparing the prices the quotes include all the taxes/surcharges/fees
-	Booking sites often charge a fee for the service, for instance
-	Ensure that the quotes you receive are ‘flexible’ (i.e. they provide an option to alter the travelling dates once the tickets are purchased)
-	Remember to convert all prices to Australian dollars when comparing quotes
-	Avoid Paper tickets – they are hard to change. Go for E-tickets
