Compare all alternatives researched and select 3 of the best options to choose from. Make a recommendation for the option you feel is best (with reasons) and give to your boss to get his/her approval and initial before booking.

### NOTE:


* Some travel companies, such as Flight Centre, are able to match or beat the prices quoted by their competitors so be sure to ask them for a competitive fare. See [Booking Online Versus Using a Travel Agent](http&#58;//aussietraveladvice.com/travel-advice-travel-tips/booking-a-holiday-online-versus-travel-agent/)
* Make sure that before comparing the prices the quotes include all the taxes/ surcharges/fees
* Booking sites often charge a fee for the service, for instance
* Ensure that the quotes you receive are 'flexible' ( i.e. they provide an option to alter the travelling dates once the tickets are purchased)
* Remember to convert all prices to Australian dollars when comparing quotes, by using the [SSW Currency Converter](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Shop/OtherCurrency.asp).
* Avoid Paper tickets - they are hard to change. Go for E-tickets
* We would recommend Google Flight and Bing travel but neither work for Australia - see [this](https&#58;//twitter.com/AdamCogan/status/413225774192537600) tweet.
