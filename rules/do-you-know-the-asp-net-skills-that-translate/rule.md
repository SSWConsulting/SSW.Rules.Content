Microsoft SharePoint Technologies is built on top of ASP.NET technologies.  In particular, MOSS 2007 is based on ASP.NET 2.0, SharePoint 2010 is based on ASP.NET 3.5, SharePoint 2013 is based on ASP.NET 4.
<!--endintro-->

This means that there are many skills that an ASP.NET developer already has that can be translated to SharePoint directly.

* Master Pages – SharePoint uses master pages
* Site Map – SharePoint uses the ASP.NET site map provider model and comes with many additional customized site map providers out of the box
* Menu – SharePoint uses ASP.NET menu controls, powered by site maps
* Page Control Lifecycle – the same key fundamental knowledge for ASP.NET is also necessary when making custom SharePoint development
* Web.Config – like ASP.NET – many SharePoint configuration is done in the Web.Config – though SharePoint provides web UI to modify many of these options from Central Administration
* .NET – Your .NET skills are definitely not going to go away
* IIS – Each SharePoint web application is a “Site” in IIS, the site bindings are also identical
