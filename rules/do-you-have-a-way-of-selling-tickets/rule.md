Managing the process of selling tickets can be very time consuming if you try and do it on your own.

<!--endintro-->

A much better approach is to use a service like [EventBrite](http&#58;//www.eventbrite.com/). SSW uses EventBrite for all events, as it allows you to manage all aspects of ticketing

* Selling
* Refunding
* Marketing
* Mailing lists
* Issuing more tickets
* And much more
