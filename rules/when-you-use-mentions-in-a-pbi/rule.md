When the Product Owner verbally requests a change to a PBI, how do you update the PBI to reflect the change and also keep track of the conversation?

<!--endintro-->

You could send yourself a "[To Myself](/dones-do-you-send-yourself-emails)" email and update the PBI description accordingly, but only those people included in the email chain are aware of the conversation. Only send a "To Myself" email when there is no Product Backlog that is related to the request, otherwise you should create or update a PBI and @ mention the Product Owner and other relevant people (@ mentioned people will still receive an email).

Instead, what you should do is use the discussions feature in the PBI and mention the user using "@&lt;username&gt;". 
The benefits of using comments are:

* Quick and easy, no need to compose an email
* History is visible to anyone looking at the PBI (with email, if you donâ€™t cc them, they wouldnâ€™t have a clue)
* Easy to see all important notes/comments in one place instead of digging through email





When someone (especially the PO) asks you to fix a PBI, mention that person in the PBI comments so they know when itâ€™s fixed.

Example: When replying to "Hey XXX, can you please fix PBI 123?"

Good example: "I have found the PBI, prioritized it near the top, and @mentioned you so you know when it is fixed"

### Azure DevOps PBIs

To create a new PBI in your Azure DevOps project:
1. Navigate to **Boards | + New Work Item** and select the type that best suits your item
2. Enter your PBI title
3. @ mention your desired user in the description

It is also good practise to use @ mention in the discussion to track changes and request test pleases. Try formatting your mentions like an email to clarify both accountability and responsiblity and identify the current status of the project.
