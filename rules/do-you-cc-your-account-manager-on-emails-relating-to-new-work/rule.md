<p>Once a project gets underway, it is not uncommon for the development&#160;team&#160;to take
                    over a lot of the project management workload. Since they are the people&#160;most in
                    contact with the client, sometimes new work will be organized through them instead
                    of the Account Manager.​

                    When this is the case, the &quot;As per our conversation&quot; email should CC the Account Manager
                    so he is always aware of all work being done, and can create a <a href="/Communication/RulesToBetterCRMForUsers/Pages/How-to-Create-New-Opportunities.aspx">new CRM opportunity</a> if required.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If an initial meeting is required for the new work, the Account Manager should be in attendance
                    where possible to help continue the relationship.

                           As per our conversation, you want to book me&#160;for another 2 weeks on this additional work.​</p>
