<span class='intro'> It is difficult for users to find their&#160;required&#160;records in a huge amount of data, so adding the filter data functionalities is very useful.&#160; 
 </span>


  <p>The standard DataGrid of ASP.NET doesn't&#160;include this functionality, developers need to implement it by themselves.</p>

    <dt><img alt="Bad Example - implement data filter manually" src="/PublishingImages/FilterDataInDataGrid.jpg" /> </dt>
    <dd>Figure&#58; Bad Example - implement data filter manually</dd>
</dl>
<p>Fortunately, RadGrid supplies this perfect feature.</p>
<dl class="goodImage">
    <dt><img alt="Good Example - add an attribute to filter data" src="/PublishingImages/FilterDataInRadGrid.jpg" /> </dt>
    <dd>Figure&#58; Good Example - add an attribute to filter data</dd>
</dl>
<p>Developer can turn this feature on&#160;by setting the AllowFilteringByColumn=&quot;True&quot;.</p>
