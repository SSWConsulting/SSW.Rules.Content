It is difficult for users to find their required records in a huge amount of data, so adding the filter data functionalities is very useful.

The standard DataGrid of ASP.NET doesn't include this functionality, developers need to implement it by themselves.

Fortunately, RadGrid supplies this perfect feature.

Developer can turn this feature on by setting the AllowFilteringByColumn="True".
