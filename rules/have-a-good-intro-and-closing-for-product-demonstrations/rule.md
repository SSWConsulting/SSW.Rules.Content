It is important to frame a product presentation with solid introduction and closing statements. 

<!--endintro-->

 **Intro:**  “Hi, I’m Steve here to show you what I just did”
 **Closing:**  “Thanks for watching”

::: greybox
 **Intro:**  “Hi, I’m Steve from SSW and I’m going to show you how our latest feature – the project breakdown report – can give you an overview of where your employees are spending their time.
 **Closing:**  “I’ve just demonstrated the usefulness of a project breakdown report to understand what it is your employees are working on”
