It is important to have solid **introduction** and **closing** statements. This is specially useful for product demonstrations.

<!--endintro-->

::: greybox
**Intro:** _"Hi, I’m Steve here to show you what I just did"_  
**Closing:** _"Thanks for watching"_

::: bad
Figure: Bad example - This closing statement ends the video abruptly, and doesn’t leave the viewer satisfied

::: greybox
**Intro:** _"Hi, I’m Steve from SSW and I’m going to show you how our latest feature – the project breakdown report – can give you an overview of where your employees are spending their time."_
**Closing:** _"I’ve just demonstrated the usefulness of a project breakdown report to understand what it is your employees are working on"_
