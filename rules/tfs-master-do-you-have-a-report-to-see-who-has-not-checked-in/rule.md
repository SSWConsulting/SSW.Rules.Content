Managers should regularly check to see if developers are committing their changes into source control. In TFS you can only get status by manually looking at each project or running "TFS status" command. A great tool is [Attrice Team Foundation SideKicks](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/c255a1e4-04ba-4f68-8f4e-cd473d6b971f) which can display the status of all users and projects

**Suggestion for TFS Sidekicks:** Add a button to “Email all people their shame list”…. showing their files that are still checked out (until then I do it manually).
