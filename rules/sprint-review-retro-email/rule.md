After any Sprint Review and Retrospective, an email should be sent to all the stakeholders to update them on the outcome from the Sprint:

<!--endintro-->

Firstly, create a new email copying the information from the previous Sprint Review/Retro. As per [Do you know what happens at a Sprint Retrospective meeting?](/do-you-know-what-happens-at-a-sprint-retrospective-meeting), it should include the following:

::: info
It's important that an [Email Group](/groups-in-microsoft-365/#microsoft-365-groups) is setup for the project, and the Sprint Review is sent to that group, so that anyone who joins the project in future can access these reports from shared inbox as per [Do you choose which Microsoft 365 Groups you follow?](/following-microsoft-365-groups)
