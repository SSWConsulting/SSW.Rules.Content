After any Sprint Review and Retrospective, an email should be sent to all the stakeholders to update them on the outcome from the Sprint:

<!--endintro-->

Firstly, create a new email copying the information from the previous Sprint Review/Retro. As per [Do you know what happens at a Sprint Retrospective meeting?](/do-you-know-what-happens-at-a-sprint-retrospective-meeting), it should include the following:
