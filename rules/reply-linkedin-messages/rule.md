6. Click Save in the upper-right corner.

## Key Aspects of the Reply Feature

Here are some keys reasons why you should consider implementing the LinkedIn reply feature.

- Pre-set responses: Setting up pre-written responses to common inquiries relating to conversation topics such as requesting a demo, careers, service requests, and general support.

- Common questions: For frequently asked questions based on the above conversation topics, automated replies provide instant information, improving the user experience and reducing the initial workload on your team.

- Conversation topics: On platforms like LinkedIn, automated replies can be aligned with selected conversation topics, ensuring relevance in responses.

- Time-saving: It significantly reduces the time spent on repetitive queries, allowing your team to focus on more complex inquiries that require personalized attention.

- Customer experience (CX): Immediate responses to inquiries, even if automated, enhance the customer experience, as users receive a prompt reply.

## Best Practices for LinkedIn Messaging

- Assign the right admin roles: Ensure that individuals with the 'super' or 'content admin' role are equipped to reply to messages. This is particularly important for specific conversation topics, like "Careers," where subject matter experts should manage interactions.

- Quick responses: Aim to reply to messages as quickly as possible to maintain engagement and show that your company values the interaction.

- Setting up conversation topics: When enabling messaging, select conversation topics that reflect the subjects you want members to inquire about. This helps in guiding the conversation and ensuring relevance.

- Edit conversation topics for accuracy: Edit the topic of a message to accurately reflect its content. This helps organizing and filtering conversations in your inbox.

- Option to disable messaging: If necessary, you can disable the messaging feature from your inbox settings. This removes the "Message" button from your Page and stops new messages from members.

#### Meta (Facebook, Instagram & WhatsApp) â€“ Setting up Automations

Meta's tools are particularly effective for businesses targeting a demographic that is highly engaged on social media, especially for consumer-focused interactions.

Meta allows you to create automated responses to your audience based on keywords, or one of their preset responses.

#### The X (formerly Twitter) Approach

X offers messaging features that might provide alternative advantages for certain business communications.

X also has some limitations, as an example, they only allow users to receive direct messages if they have agreed to receive messages, or if they are verified. Learn more about their limitations here.
