- **Autonomy** — Software developers have a desire to be self-directed. Many find that micro-management is restrictive and stifles their creativity. 
- **Mastery** — Software developers love sharpening their skills. 
- **Purpose** — Software developers want to work on important projects that have meaning and make an impact.
