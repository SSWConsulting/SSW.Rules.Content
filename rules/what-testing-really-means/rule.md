Everyone thinks they know what "testing" is. Like most things, though, there isn't a shared understanding of what testing really means across the IT industry. 

Distinguishing "testing" and "checking" is a great way to help build this shared understanding when we're talking about this critical part of the software development process.

## Common perceptions of "testing"

A commonly held view is that the purpose of testing is to detect non-conformances
between a product and its specifications, so that they may be resolved. Specifications may exist on several levels and the concept of "verification" means checking a component against its immediate specification.

"Testing" is often conflated with "finding bugs" and we all know how easy it is to find bugs in the software we use every day:



> There's a reason that many people think testing is easy, due to an asymmetry. No one ever fired up a computer and stumbled into creating a slick UI or a sophisticated algorithm, but people stumble into bugs every day. Finding bugs is easy, they think. So testing must be easy.

## Testing and checking

Let's dive into the definitions of ***testing*** and ***checking*** from James Bach and Michael Bolton (in [Testing and Checking Refined](https://www.satisfice.com/blog/archives/856)):

:::greybox
**Testing** is the process of evaluating a product by learning about it through experiencing, exploring, and experimenting, which includes to some degree: questioning, study, modeling, observation, inference, etc.

**Checking** is the process of making evaluations by applying algorithmic decision rules to specific observations of a product.
