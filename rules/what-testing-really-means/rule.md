Everyone thinks they know what "testing" is. Like most things, though, there isn't a shared understanding of what "testing really means across the IT industry. 

Distinguishing "testing" and "checking" is a great way to help build this shared understanding when we're talking about this critical part of the software development process.

[Testing and Checking Refined](https://www.satisfice.com/blog/archives/856)

Testing is the process of evaluating a product by learning about it through experiencing, exploring, and experimenting, which includes to some degree: questioning, study, modeling, observation, inference, etc.

Checking is the process of making evaluations by applying algorithmic decision rules to specific observations of a product.
