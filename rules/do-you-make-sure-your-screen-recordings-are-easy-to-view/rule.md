Most developers like to set up their screen efficiently – often that means small fonts, visible bookmark bars and a huge amount of browser tabs and taskbar items. While this is great for efficiency, it is not very good for recordings or presentations, and the clutter should be removed.

<!--endintro-->



Before recording your screen reduce visual noise by:

### Unnecessary tabs


Open the tab in its own window

### Small fonts


Zoom in to 125% by holding Ctrl and scrolling up on the mouse wheel

### Unnecessary bookmark bar


* Windows shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + b
* Mac shortcut: Cmd + Shift + b
