There comes a time when some contacts in your CRM database might just be taking up space and not giving any value. At this point it is best to deactivate them.
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<ul>
          <li>CRM still knows about it so it will still come up for duplicate detection.</li>
          <li>You can still view them if you need to by viewing Inactive companies/contacts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>Hint:</b> When you deactivate a client - put a note in the notes field to say
          why first.</p><p><img src="CRM-DeactivateContact.jpg" alt="CRM-DeactivateContact.jpg" style="margin:5px;" /><br></p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureNormal">​​​​​Figure: Once a contact moves on or their details are no longer relevant, deactivate them<br></dd>
