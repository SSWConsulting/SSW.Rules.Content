<p>You're the one paying the bills, make sure you know where the costs are and how the project is progressing. </p>
<p>Insist on receiving these 3 reports in every Review Meeting:</p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<ul><li>Project Progress ($ spent)</li>
<li>Burndown (ETA) </li>
<li>Story Overview (testing quality)</li></ul>
<p>Let's look at those 3 reports:</p>
<h1>1. Current project costs</h1>
<p>This allows you to see the actual costs of the project on a weekly basis.</p>
