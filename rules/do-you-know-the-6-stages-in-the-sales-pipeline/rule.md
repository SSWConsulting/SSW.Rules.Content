Any opportunity that has not yet been converted to a sale will be at one of the following 6 stages:

<!--endintro-->

1. Initial Phone Call
    * The client has made contact but no initial meeting has yet been made
2. Initial Meeting – Booked
    * You've arranged an initial meeting and it's booked in
3. Follow Up Meeting – Booked
    * In some cases, more than one initial meeting may be required before work or speccing commences
4. Spec Review Proposal – Waiting for Approval
    * After the initial meeting, if the work requires it, a specification review is proposed
5. Spec Review – Booked
    * The speccing phase has been approved and booked in
6. Project Proposal – Waiting for Approval
    * After the spec review, the client has been given a proposal for a chunk of work. Once this is approved, the opportunity is closed as won


The old Sales Pipeline was 9 steps, whereas this new one is 6 steps.
