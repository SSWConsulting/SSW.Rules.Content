If you don't understand something in Jira and want it explained, simply [Create an Issue](/Pages/JiraRequest.aspx) in the project Jira of type Task [like this](/Pages/CreateTask.aspx).  If the question is good for all, it will be made into a rule for all.  If the suggestion is approved, it will be implemented.  You will, of course, be able to [track](/Pages/TrackingRequests.aspx)the status of what you create so that we can work efficiently on the right things in a visible way.
