The following table shows the right format for writing video time lengths (hours, minutes, seconds) on the web.
            
<!--endintro-->

| Duration | Correct format | ❌ Bad examples | ✅ Good example |
|---|---|---|---|
| Less than 1 minute | {{x}} sec | 30s / 30secs / 30 secs | 30 sec |
| 1 to 59 minutes | {{x}} min | 25m / 25mins / 25 mins | 25 min |
| 1 hour | {{x}} h | 60 mins / 1 hour / 1h 00m | 1 hr |
| More then 1 hour | {{x}} h {{x}} m| 1h 05m / 1h5min / 1h 5m 10s | 1 hr 5 min |

**Notes:** 

- You should ignore seconds for anything longer than 1 minute

- Although "mins" is a commonly used abbreviation for minutes, you should be aware that it is not correct for scientific use. See [when to use "mins" or "min" as an abbreviation for minutes](https://livexp.com/blog/is-it-min-or-mins-in-the-plural) for more information
