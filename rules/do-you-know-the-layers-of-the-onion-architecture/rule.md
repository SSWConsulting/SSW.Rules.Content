<h3>Application Core (the grey stuff)</h3><p>This should be the big meaty part of the application where the domain logic resides.</p><h3>Domain Model</h3><p>In the very centre we see the Domain Model, which represents the state and behaviour combination that models truth for the organization and is only coupled to itself.</p><h3>Repository Interfaces</h3><p>The first layer around the Domain Model is typically where we find interfaces that provide object saving and retrieving behaviour.&#160;<br>The object saving behaviour is not in the application core, however, because it typically involves a database.&#160; Only the interface is&#160;in the application core.&#160; The actual implementation is a dependency which is injected.</p><h3>Business Logic Interfaces</h3><p>Business logic is also exposed via interfaces to provide decoupling of business logic. <br>Examples of where this is useful include substituting a FacebookNotificationService for an EmailNotificationService or a FedExShippingCalculator for a DHLShippingCalculator</p><h3>Clients (the red stuff)</h3><p>The outer layer is reserved for things that change often.&#160; E.g. UI and the other applications that consume the Application Core.&#160;<br>This includes the MVC project.<br>Any interface dependencies in factories, services, repositories, etc, are injected into the domain by the controller.<br>This means any constructor-injected interfaces in domain classes are resolved automatically by the IoC container.</p><h3>Dependencies</h3><p>Dependencies are implementations of interfaces defined in&#160;Repository and Business Logic Interfaces&#160;and&#160;Domain.<br>These classes are specific implementations and can be coupled to a particular method of data access, or specific service technology.<br>e.g. this is where the EF DbContext is implemented, as well as things like logging, email sending, etc.<br>These dependencies are injected into the application core. <br>Because the Application core only relies on abstractions of the dependencies, it is easy to update them.<br>The Onion Architecture relies heavily on the&#160;<a href="http&#58;//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle">Dependency Inversion </a> <span></span><span></span><span></span><span>principle</span>and other <a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=21a9d999-80cd-4e39-a5f5-c511522ffcb2">SOLID principles</a>.</p><h4>References&#58;</h4><ul><li>
