Every change to an appointment is a hassle, and it's good to be explicit as to why the appointment had to change, so always give a reason. It's also a good idea to make the number of changes visibale by adding a version history. This shows the people who are requesting numerous changes how many changes they've asked for! When we hit v7, people will start questioning how this has happened.

Whenever you have to modify the time, attendees, or subject of an appointment, always send the updated appointment with comments at the top to explain why you want to make these changes.

There are two key ways to do this:

1. Actions words - These are prepended to any notes that you add to the top of the appointment so that people can "at-a-glance", understand what's going on with the change. E.g. "**Updated**: Changed time from 9:00am to 10:00am"
2. Version Numbers - Adding these to the notes can help people to track all of the changes and, subtly, remind people that if they're on v5 😖, something else might be going wrong. E.g. "**Updated v8**: Moved from Tuesday 7:00pm to Wednesday 9:00am"

This technique helps alleviate confusion.

You should also include a "Note:" in case you have reasons to break a rule.

**Note:** Not sending leave as a full-day appointment to avoid time-zone issues with bookings

If you need to update the same appointment a few times, a good approach is to add **v1**, **v2** and so on, so you track the updates as you add them.
