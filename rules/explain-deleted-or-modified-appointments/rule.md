Every change to an appointment is a hassle, and it's good to be explicit as to why the appointment had to change, so always give a reason. Unlike an email, changing an appointment will not have the original content recorded, it is a good idea to make the date visible by adding it to the changes history. This shows the timeline of the changes and how many changes they've asked for! When we have numerous changes, people will start questioning how this has happened.

Whenever you have to modify the time, attendees, or subject of an appointment, always send the updated appointment with comments at the top to explain why you want to make these changes.

There are two key ways to do this:

1. Actions words - These are prepended to any notes that you add to the top of the appointment so that people can "at-a-glance", understand what's going on with the change. 

     E.g. "**Updated** 30/03/2023: Changed time from 25/03/2023 9:00am to 30/03/2023 10:00am"
2. Date of changes - Adding dates to the notes can help people to track all of the changes. 

     E.g. "Updated **30/03/2023**: Changed time from 30/03/2023 9:00am to 04/04/2023 9:00am"

### Good Examples ✔️

* Changing the date or time:

::: greybox
**Updated 30/03/2023:** Moving to Thursday as Adam could not make it
:::

* Adding someone as per [adding or removing someone from a conversation](/do-you-know-how-to-add-or-remove-someone-from-the-conversation):

::: greybox
**Updated 30/03/2023:** Adding Uly since he may want to know that we are working on TimePro this day
:::

* Changing the subject. Learn more on [when you should change a subject](/do-you-know-when-you-should-change-a-subject):

::: greybox
**Updated 30/03/2023:** Changed subject as we will be talking about Marketing first
:::

* Removing an appointment

::: greybox
**Deleted 30/03/2023:** Meeting has been cancelled
:::

* Let others know if you need to break a rule - You should also include a "Note:" in case you have reasons to break a rule.

::: greybox
**Note 30/03/2023:** Not sending leave as a full-day appointment to avoid time-zone issues with bookings 
:::

If you need to update the same appointment a few times, a good approach is to add dates of change, so you track the updates as you add them.
