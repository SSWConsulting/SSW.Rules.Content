Every change to an appointment is a hassle, and it's good to be explicit as to why the appointment had to change, so always give a reason. 

Unlike an email, changing an appointment will not have the original content recorded, it is a good idea to make it visible by adding the version number and date of changes to the history. This shows the timeline of the changes and how many changes they've asked for! When we have v7, people will start questioning how this has happened.

Whenever you have to modify the time, attendees, or subject of an appointment, always send the updated appointment with comments at the top to explain why you want to make these changes.

There are two key ways to do this:

1. Version number - Adding the v# to the notes can help people to track all of the changes. 

     E.g. "**V2** - Updated 27/03: Changed time to 04/04 9:00am because Bob can not make it"
     
2. Actions words and date of change - These are prepended to any notes that you add to the top of the appointment so that people can "at-a-glance", understand what's going on with the change and when the changes are happened.

     E.g. "V3 - **Updated 30/03**: Changed time to 15/04 10:00am because Bob can not make it again"

### Good Examples âœ…

* Changing the date or time:

::: greybox
V2 - Updated 30/03: Moving to Thursday as Adam could not make it
:::

* Adding someone as per [adding or removing someone from a conversation](/do-you-know-how-to-add-or-remove-someone-from-the-conversation):

::: greybox
V3 - Updated 30/03: Adding Uly since he may want to know that we are working on TimePro this day
:::

* Changing the subject. Learn more on [when you should change a subject](/do-you-know-when-you-should-change-a-subject):

::: greybox
V5 - Updated 30/03: Changed subject as we will be talking about Marketing first
:::

* Removing an appointment

::: greybox
Deleted 30/03: Meeting has been cancelled
:::

You do not need to include the version number when deleting the appointment.

If you need to update the same appointment a few times, a good approach is to add version number and dates of change, so you track the updates as you add them.
