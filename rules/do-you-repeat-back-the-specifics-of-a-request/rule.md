<p>
                   Misunderstanding due to miscommunication can cause major disasters at work or in life (see&#58; <a class="external" target="_blank" href="/ssw/Redirect/StandardsRules/Wikipedia.htm">http&#58;//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenerife_disaster</a>).  A good communication strategy when receiving instructions is to repeat back what's being said to avoid misunderstanding.
