Your deleted items can become quite out of hand if you don't manage them. First, it can waste a lot of space on your hard drive, and second, after accidentally deleting a mail item, it can take days to find it again amongst the 30,000 messages in your Deleted Items Folder.

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-right:0px;">Here's a couple of solutions:</p><ul><li>Permanently delete your deleted items. This is based on the theory that once you have deleted a mail item, you should NEVER HAVE TO LOOK AT IT AGAIN. This is a good theory, but unfortunately, we don't always follow it in practice and there's no recovery</li><li>Move the items into subfolders under Deleted Items. This is a good solution as you can manually archive items, making it easier to search. You can permanently delete items when they reach a certain age.</li></ul><dl class="goodImage"><dt><img src="OulookDeletedItemsSubFolders.gif" alt="Oulook Deleted Items" /></dt><dd>Figure: Good Example - Deleted Items ordered into time periods</dd></dl><p><b>Note:</b> A hot tip for making it easy to search for an accidentally deleted item is to add the "Modified" field into your Deleted Items view and sort by "Modified".
