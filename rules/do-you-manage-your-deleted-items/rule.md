Your deleted items can become quite out of hand if you don't manage them. First, it can waste a lot of space on your hard drive, and second, after accidentally deleting a mail item, it can take days to find it again amongst the 30,000 messages in your Deleted Items Folder.

  <p style="margin-right&#58;0px;" dir="ltr">Here's a couple of solutions&#58;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Permanently delete your deleted items. This is based on the theory that once you have deleted a mail item, you should NEVER HAVE TO LOOK AT IT AGAIN. This is a good theory, but unfortunately we don't always follow it in practice and there's no recovery </li>
    <li>Move the items into subfolders under Deleted Items. This is a good solution as you can manually archive items, making it easier to search. You can permanently delete items when they reach a certain age. </li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr">NOTE&#58; A hot tip for making it easy to search for an accidentally deleted item is to add the &quot;Modified&quot; field into your Deleted Items view and sort by &quot;Modified&quot;. The item from two months ago which you just accidentally deleted will be sitting at the top.</p>
