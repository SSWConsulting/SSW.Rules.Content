Readability of URLs is important, so you should consider making a short URL. However, it is not just making the length as short as possible - it should be friendly.

So you should only 'Auto Shorten URLs' when it is too long and you need the space.

However, it is becoming more prevalent for the software to support showing the full URL on rollover.
