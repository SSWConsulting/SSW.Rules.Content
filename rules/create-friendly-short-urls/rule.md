Readability of URLs is important, so you should consider making a short URL. However, it is not just making the length as short as possible - it should be friendly. 

<!--endintro-->

If you use a shortened link people can't see what they are clicking through to. In fact, this is what most spammers rely on:


I want to be able to type this URL in, but it is VERY long:

::: ok
OK example - Short URL, but how will people remember that? And where are you going?

When you can, take the more readable option:

::: greybox

Good example - Short URL, easier to remember

So you should only 'Auto Shorten URLs' when it is too long and you need the space.

However, it is becoming more prevalent for the software to support showing the full URL on rollover.
