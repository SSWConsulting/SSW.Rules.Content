When going through leads to see if they should be converted to an Account/Contact/Opportunity           or disqualified, any that do not contain contact details should be deleted instead           of disqualified. The reason for this is that there is no benefit having only a name           in the system, and it could produce false duplicates later if we were to import           or create someone with the same name.
