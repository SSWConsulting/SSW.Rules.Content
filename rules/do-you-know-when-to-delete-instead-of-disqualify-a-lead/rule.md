<span class='intro'> <p>â€‹
          When going through leads to see if they should be converted to an Account/Contact/Opportunity
          or disqualified, any that do not contain contact details should be deleted instead
          of disqualified. The reason for this is that there is no benefit having only a name
          in the system, and it could produce false duplicates later if we were to import
          or create someone with the same name.
        </p> </span>
