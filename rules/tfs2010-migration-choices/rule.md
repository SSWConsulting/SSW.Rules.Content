There are many options for migrating to TFS 2010 from TFS 2008.

<!--endintro-->

1. Bit by bit - Migrate some projects (keep both TFS2008 and TFS2010 online)
2. Migrate all (recommended – this is what these rules will be about)

For help on determining the optimum path for you check out [Bryan Krieger's post on the subject](http://blogs.msdn.com/bkrieger/archive/2009/10/21/team-foundation-server-2010-upgrade.aspx)
