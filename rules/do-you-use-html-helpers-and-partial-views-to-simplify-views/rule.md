Repeated sections of User Interface should be encapsulated in either Html Helpers or Partial Views to avoid repetition.

<!--endintro-->


::: greybox


```
<div class="featured">
    @if (ViewData.ContainsKey("FeaturedProduct"))
    {
        <span class="ProductName">@ViewBag.FeaturedProduct.Name</span>
        <span class="ProductPrice">@ViewBag.FeaturedProduct.Price</span>
    }
</div>
```


:::
Figure: Bad Example – The above code could be encapsulated into a Partial View for reuse

::: greybox


```
public static class DateExtensions
{
    public static MvcHtmlString GetTodayDate(this System.Web.Mvc.HtmlHelper helper)
    {
        return new MvcHtmlString(DateTime.Now.ToShortDateString());
    }
}
@Html.GetTodayDate()
```

Figure: Good Example – Using an HTML Helper extension method for reusable code

::: greybox


```
@Html.Partial("_FeaturedProduct")
```
