Repeated sections of User Interface should be encapsulated in either Html Helpers or Partial Views to avoid repetition.

<!--endintro-->

```cs
<div class="featured">
    @if (ViewData.ContainsKey("FeaturedProduct"))
    {
        <span class="ProductName">@ViewBag.FeaturedProduct.Name</span>
        <span class="ProductPrice">@ViewBag.FeaturedProduct.Price</span>
    }
</div>
```

::: bad
Figure: Bad example – The above code could be encapsulated into a Partial View for reuse
:::

```cs
public static class DateExtensions
{
    public static MvcHtmlString GetTodayDate(this System.Web.Mvc.HtmlHelper helper)
    {
        return new MvcHtmlString(DateTime.Now.ToShortDateString());
    }
}
@Html.GetTodayDate()
```

@Html.Partial("_FeaturedProduct")
