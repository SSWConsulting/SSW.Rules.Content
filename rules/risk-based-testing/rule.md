We know that [complete testing is impossible](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/complete-testing-is-impossible) so how do we decide which finite set of tests to perform out of the infinite cloud of possible tests for a story, feature or release?

This problem can seem overwhelming, but focusing on risk is a good approach. Let's look at the idea of risk-based testing.

<!--endintro-->

### What is risk-based testing?

Risk-based testing uses an analysis of quality risks to prioritize tests and allocate testing effort

what is risk? And quality risk?
Risk: the possibility of a negative or undesirable event or
outcome
Quality risk: the possibility that the product or system might fail to deliver one or more of the key quality attributes endangering our ability to achieve the quality attributes, endangering our ability to achieve the quality
outcomes we want

### How does a risk-based approach help with test planning?

Risk-based testin
g g delivers the followin
g benefits
Running the tests in risk order gives the highest likelihood of discovering defects in severity order (“find the scary stuff first”)
Allocating test effort based on risk is the most efficient way to minimize the residual quality risk upon release ( minimize the residual quality risk upon release ( pick the right “pick the right tests out of the infinite cloud of possible tests”)
Measuring test results based on risk will allows the organization to know the residual level of quality risk during test execution and to make smart release decisions ( test execution, and to make smart release decisions ( release “release when risk of delay balances risk of dissatisfaction”)
If schedule requires, dropping tests in reverse risk order reduces the test execution period with the least possible increase in quality risk ( increase in quality risk ( give up tests you worry about the “give up tests you worry about the least”)
All of these benefits allow the test team to operate more efficiently and in a targeted fashion, especially in timeconst i d d/ tra
