Spec Reviews are a vital part of architecting a new solution for a client, they are the plans upon which the project is modeled and also serve as a key stage in the pre-sales process for software development consultancies. They create an opportunity for the developers to demonstrate expertise and provide immediate value to the client, this is

## Importance of Specification Reviews

The documentation delivered at the end of the Spec Review is the foundation upon which the project is built. It is imperative that the proposed solution meets the client's needs as closely as possible, this includes proposing the correct choice of technologies (factoring in their budget from [corridor conversations](https://ssw.com.au/rules/corridor-conversations/)) and an accurate roadmap, with reasonable estimates of time required.

Involving developers with no experience in Spec Reviews can lead to significant issues; underestimates, a misunderstanding of the right stack for the job or a miscommunication between the developer and the client could all have huge implications on the success of the project down the line.. This highlights the need for a structured training approach.

## Learning Through Shadowing

### Shadowing Experienced Architects

* **Practical Approach**: Shadowing two experienced solution architects during a review session is the most effective training method. It provides real-time observation and understanding of the review process.
* **No Cost to Clients**: This training approach incurs no additional cost to the client, ensuring an efficient and economical learning process.

### Required Shadowing and Assistance

* **Shadowing Phase**: Developers must shadow at least one spec review, observing and understanding the review's different aspects.
* **Assistance Phase**: Developers then assist in at least one spec review as a secondary developer, applying their observations and understanding their role in the process.

## Transition to Independent Reviews

After successfully completing the shadowing and assistance phases, developers are ready to conduct spec reviews independently, equipped with the necessary knowledge and experience.
