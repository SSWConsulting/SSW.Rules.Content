When the user is creating or editing data on a webpage, there are 2 buttons and one link you need to provide.

<!--endintro-->

These three options are:

* Save (button) - Saves the data and allows the user to keep editing
* Save and Close (button) - Saves the data and returns to the previous screen
* Cancel (link) - returns to the previous screen
