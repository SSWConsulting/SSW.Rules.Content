When others mention you on their blog or podcast and if they re-tweet you then you should always thank them:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/briankel?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@briankel</a> said something nice about me in his 100th This Week On Channel 9 episode http://bit.ly/cPD0vg :) Thanks Brian...</p>&mdash; Martin Hinshelwood 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 🇪🇺 🇲🇽 (@MrHinsh) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrHinsh/status/10160987074?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 8, 2010</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>  

::: good
Figure: Good example, always thanking someone is not just good practice and polite, you both get Google juice as well

Remember to say something constructive and not just "thanks".
