It doesn’t matter what type of information you have, suffering a data loss is frustrating and takes time and money to restore and recover. 

Whenever you have to delete content, take an extra step and and **paste it into an email thread as a safety step**.

This way it's easy for others to see what was removed, and put it back if necessary.
