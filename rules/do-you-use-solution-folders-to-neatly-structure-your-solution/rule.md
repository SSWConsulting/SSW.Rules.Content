<span class='intro'> â€‹All the DLL references and files needed to create a setup.exe should be included in your solution. However, just including them as solution items is not enough, they will look very disordered (especially when you have a lot of solution items). And from the screenshot below, you might be wondering what the _Instructions.docx&#160;is used for...

<font class="ms-rteCustom-FigureBad">Bad example - An unstructured solution folder</font>
<p>An ideal way is to create &quot;sub-solution folders&quot; for the solution items, the common ones are &quot;References&quot; and &quot;Setup&quot;. This will make your solution items look neat and in order. Look at the screenshot below, now it makes sense, we know that the _Instructions.docx&#160;contains the instructions of what to do when creating a setup.exe. </p><dl class="ssw15-rteElement-ImageArea">
