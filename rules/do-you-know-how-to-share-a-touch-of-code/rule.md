<span class='intro'> <p>​Any regular blogger who writes about code knows that embedding code snippets into their posts can be a real pain!&#160;​<br></p><div>Syntax highlighting, special tags and keeping a track of your code snippets can be a nightmare. As a developer, you're sold on the virtues of source control, making changes then rolling back, forking, and cloning code. Wouldn't it be great if there were a simple way to share a touch of code?</div> </span>

The standout feature of Github Gists is that every code snippet (often referred to by GitHub as a Gist) is behind the scenes a Git repository, which in turn gives you access to all of the benefits of source control.</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">Upon editing an already published Gist, the previous versions are preserved. As to be expected with any good source control, you can use the built-in diff engine to highlight clearly the changes between any two versions of a single Gist. This sounds like it can get out of hand quickly, but you can easily view all your Gists by heading to https&#58;//gist.github.com/&lt;username&gt;/.&#160;</p><dl class="goodImage"><dt> <img src="/SiteAssets/do-you-know-how-to-share-a-touch-of-code/2015-12-03_15-46-34.png" alt="2015-12-03_15-46-34.png" style="width&#58;800px;" /> </dt><dd>Figure - Easy to review your Gists. </dd></dl><p>It is very simple to embed your code snippets using Github Gists, as you can embed any Gist in your blog with a single a line of JavaScript.
