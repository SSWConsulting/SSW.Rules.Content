Your goal should be to get the issues in a solution down to zero.
If you believe the issues being raised are not important, please check the section below which outlines how to change the ruleset.

### Modify Visual Studio Analysis Ruleset


The goal is to develop a shared ruleset across projects. (Currently this is just the default settings). This will ensure the same standard and quality of code is maintained across all of the company's projects.
Any project specific rules should be documented in "\_Instructions-CodeHealth.docx" which is to be kept in the solution.
Please also copy the current version number of this rule into the "\_Instructions-CodeHealth.docx" in order to track what version your existing solution adheres to.
