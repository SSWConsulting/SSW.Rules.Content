Despite what it looks like, the var keyword is not a throwback to the dark ages where we did not have strongly typed variables. It is just a short hand to save developers from typing out the type of a variable.

```csharp
IQueryable<Customers> results =
    from c in dbContext.Customers
    where c.CompanyName.StartsWith(companyNameTextbox.Text)
    select c;
customersBindingSource.DataSource = results;
```
::: bad
Figure: Bad example - You should just use "var" instead of "IQueryable"

```csharp
var results =
    from c in dbContext.Customers
    where c.CompanyName.StartsWith(companyNameTextbox.Text)
    select c;
customersBindingSource.DataSource = results;
```
