Do you sometimes spend time answering unnecessarily complicated questions? This can be quite a pain, and cost valuable time. Or, when you're asking someone a question about something that is blocking you, do you ever get frustrated when the person reads your message but doesn't reply? This can lead to a series of reminders and time spent chasing them up.

Asking easy questions saves time for both parties and gets to the answer as quick as possible.

# Make your questions easy to respond to

Open ended questions take more time and effort to reply to. If you need an answer quickly, you should aim to make as easy as possible for the other person to respond. The easier it is for the other person to respond, the quicker and more effective your communication will be. Therefore, you should always aim for the simplest way you can phrase your question without losing the important points. Depending on your question, you should approach asking it differently - make sure that the way you ask the question matches the level of importance and complexity.

### Yes or no

This type of question is the easiest to answer. The clearest way to phrase it is with a 'y or n' at the end of your question.

### Simple questions
