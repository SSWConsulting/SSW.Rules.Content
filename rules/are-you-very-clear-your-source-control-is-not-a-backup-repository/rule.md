<span class='intro'> ​Note&#58; If you&#160;did not finish&#160;working&#58;<br><ul><li>TFS put changes into shelveset </li>
<li>SVN put changes into sandbox / branches </li></ul>
Note&#58; Another way to do this is to enable gated check-in and prevent check-ins that do not have build and tests passed.  </span>
