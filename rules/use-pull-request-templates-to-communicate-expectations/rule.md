Pull Request templates are a great way to communicate expectations to developers. You should can create different PR templates for different types of PRs. For example, you can have a PR template for bug fixes, a PR template for new features, and a PR template for refactoring. You are also able to create specific PR templates for specific code paths.

You can read more about PR templates in the GitHub docs at [Creating a pull request template for your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository)
