<p>For planned outages see&#58; <a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=e3a456b4-3513-4dbe-a958-0176c1dfa85d">https&#58;//rules.ssw.com.au/have-a-server-reboot-restart-policy</a></p><p>During your course of being a SysAdmin, you will come across many outages. Some of them will impact BAU (Business as usual) and others will just be minor service outages. Do you know what to do you have a plan in the event of these outages?<br></p><p>Below is a process for these types of outages. Some amount of common sense is required here, an outage would be if services that would affect BAU work are disrupted for SSW and/or some hardware has failed.​​<br></p>
