As part of the update to the Scrum Guide for 2013, there is a concept of a product backlog being "Ready".

<!--endintro-->

Just like how the team has a     [Definition of Done](/definition-of-done) as a checklist for completing a PBI, the product owner needs a Definition of Ready to get the PBI in a state that’s ready for it to be added to a sprint. This should be done as part of the refinement (aka grooming) process and will greatly streamline the sprint planning meeting.

A recommended “Definition of Ready” would be:

* Has enough detail for the team to action (usually via good Acceptance Criteria)
* Has 
      [Business Value](/do-you-estimate-business-value) assigned
* Has effort assigned
* Is in the Approved state


**Related Rule:**

* [Done - Do you go beyond 'Done' and follow a 'Definition of Done'?](/definition-of-done)
