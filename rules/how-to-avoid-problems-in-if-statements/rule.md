Try to avoid problems in if-statements without curly brackets and just one statement which is written one line below the if-statement. Use just one line for such if-statements. If you want to add more statements later on and you could forget to add the curly brackets which may cause problems later on.

 ProductVersion = string.Empty; if (StackTrace == null) StackTrace = string.Empty;
