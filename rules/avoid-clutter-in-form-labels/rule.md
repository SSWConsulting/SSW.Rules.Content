Labels are essential for guiding users on what information to enter in a form field. To improve readability and consistency, keep labels clean and concise. Avoid unnecessary words and don’t end them with a colon (:), which is a common but outdated practice.

**Tip:** In web UIs like profile cards or contact pages, [labels should be avoided whenever the content is self-explanatory](/avoid-labels) (e.g.: “Phone:” or “Email:”). Keep it clean: less is more.
