First things first. You need to be able to list some of the main reasons why people may call you. When you know what some of these are it puts you in a better position to prepare yourself for action or an intelligent and helpful response. For example, if you're a restaurant you better have your reservation systems close to the phone and if you're a bank you better be ready for some abuse. At SSW we find that people call us for only a few reasons:

- For [information](/be-prepared-for-inbound-calls) about our consulting, products or events
- To [speak to someone specific](/transfer-a-call-quickly)
- And not very often to [complain](/make-complaints-a-positive-experience)
