Why do we use it? 
The TV Team are consistently creating YouTube Chapter Links for videos such as the User Groups, Tech News Videos etc. In the past, this has been a manual and tedious process. However, this is no longer the case!  

We have developed a fast and easy method to export Premiere Pro Markers as YouTube Chapter Links.

## Before Starting

Make sure you know which hotkey in Premiere Pro hotkey is for markers. The default is set to ‘M’ on your keyboard.

1. Add an Introduction Marker (00:00). YouTube requires every video to have an introduction marker if you want the chapter links to take effect.
