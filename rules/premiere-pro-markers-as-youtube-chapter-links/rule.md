Video producers are consistently creating YouTube Chapter Links for videos such as the User Groups, Tech News Videos etc. This helps users to go to an specific section of the video.

In the past, this has been a manual and tedious process. However, this is no longer the case!  

The fastest method is the Auto Chapter Links method (see below)

### How to use the Auto Chapter Links method

This method is basically exporting Adobe Premiere Pro Markers as YouTube Chapter Links.

Make sure you know which hotkey in Premiere Pro hotkey is for markers. The default is set to ‘M’ on your keyboard.

1. Add an Introduction Marker (00:00). YouTube requires every video to have an introduction marker if you want the chapter links to take effect.

2. Create your chapter markers for every new topic/section in the talk
