It's essential to keep Sprint Reviews as efficient as possible. Unfortunately, Sprint Reviews can be boring because they involve developers slowly demoing Product Backlog Items (PBIs) to the Product Owner. This process is fine, but presenting the PBIs can take some time and isn't engaging for those not involved in the PBI. Better communication with the Product Owner can transform this into a swift "tick and flick" process, leading to more efficient reviews.

### What does making a PBI "tick and flick" mean?

Getting a PBI into a "tick and flick" state involves ensuring that the Product Owner has been notified of the PBI, reviewed the changes and provided feedback. 

If the Product Owner has done these things, then when the PBI is reached in the Sprint Review, the developer can let the Product Owner know it's already been reviewed and ask if they are happy to move on.

### How do you make a PBI "tick and flick"?

Every project is different, so the process will differ depending on the project and the Product Owners preferences. However, the general idea is that you communicate the completion of a PBI to the Product Owner and give them a visual indication of what was changed. 

Here are some tips that help make a PBI "tick and flick":

1. [Use @mentions in a PBI](/when-you-use-mentions-in-a-pbi/) - Utilize @Â mentions in a PBI to alert the Product Owner and other relevant team members about any updates, questions, or issues related to a PBI. Using @mentions ensures that everyone stays informed, and any concerns are addressed before the Sprint Review.
2. [Document Decisions and Discoveries](/document-discoveries) - While working on the PBI make comments about any decisions or discoveries, that way when a Product Owner reviews the PBI they will be able to see the context of everything that happend.
3. [Close the PBI with context](/close-pbis-with-context) - By adding relevant information to close off the PBI, the Product Owner can quickly get a handle on the status of the PBI.
4. [Send 'Done' emails](/done-do-you-know-when-to-send-a-done-email-in-scrum) - Use 'Done' emails to notify the Product Owner when a PBI has been completed. This includes a brief description of the work done, links to relevant documentation, and any other essential information. Sending these emails helps keep the Product Owner informed and allows them to prepare for the Sprint Review.
5. [Send 'Done' videos](/do-you-send-done-videos) - When appropriate, make a habit of including a short video demonstrating the completion of a PBI in your done email. This will give the Product Owner an opportunity to review the work before the Sprint Review meeting, saving time and ensuring any issues are addressed beforehand.
6. Call the Product Owner to run through what's been done in the PBI

By incorporating these tips into your team's workflow, and making PBIs "tick and flick" you can keep the Product Owner informed and subsequently make Sprint Reviews as fast as possible.
