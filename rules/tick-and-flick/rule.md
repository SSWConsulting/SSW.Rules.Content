It's essential to keep Sprint Reviews as efficient as possible. To achieve this, it's crucial to have a streamlined process for notifying the Product Owner when a Product Backlog Item (PBI) is completed. By following the guidelines outlined in the resources below, your team can quickly review each PBI demo and make your Sprint Review a "tick and flick" process.

<!--endintro-->

1. [Send 'Done' emails](/done-do-you-know-when-to-send-a-done-email-in-scrum) - Use 'Done' emails to notify the Product Owner when a PBI has been completed. This includes a brief description of the work done, links to relevant documentation, and any other essential information. Sending these emails helps keep the Product Owner informed and allows them to prepare for the Sprint Review.
2. [Send 'Done' videos](/do-you-send-done-videos) - When appropriate, make a habit of including a short video demonstrating the completion of a PBI in your done email. This will give the Product Owner an opportunity to review the work before the Sprint Review meeting, saving time and ensuring any issues are addressed beforehand.
3. [Use @mentions in a PBI](/when-you-use-mentions-in-a-pbi/) - Utilize @Â mentions in a PBI to alert the Product Owner and other relevant team members about any updates, questions, or issues related to a PBI. Using @mentions ensures that everyone stays informed, and any concerns are addressed before the Sprint Review.

By incorporating these rules into your team's workflow, you can keep your Product Owner informed about the progress of each PBI and ensure that your Sprint Review meetings are efficient, effective, and focused on quickly reviewing each demo. This will help make your Sprint Review a smooth "tick and flick" experience, saving time and keeping your project on track.
