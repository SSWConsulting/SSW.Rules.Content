### Sprint Retrospective


As part of our commitment to inspect and adapt as a team we conduct a Sprint Retrospective at the end of every Sprint. Here are the results of our Sprint Retrospective:

**What went well?** 
&lt;insert what went well from retro&gt;

**What didnâ€™t go so well?** 
&lt;insert what did not went well from retro&gt;

**What improvements will be made for the next Sprint?** 
&lt;insert what improvements will be made for the next Sprint&gt;

**Definition of Ready** ***- Optional***

&lt;insert the definition of Ready. Normally that the PBIs are Sized with Acceptance criteria added&gt;

**Definition of Done** ***- Optional***

&lt;insert Definition of Done. Normally that it compiles, meets the acceptance criteria, and a test please has been sent if relevant&gt;

&lt;This is as per the rule:        [https://rules.ssw.com.au/do-you-create-a-sprint-review-retro-email](/do-you-create-a-sprint-review-retro-email) /&gt;
