<span class='intro'> <p>When somebody sends you an <b>IM message</b>, they are&#160;interrupting you.&#160;</p><p>When somebody sends you an <b>email</b>, they are not interrupting you - assuming you keep your notifications off as per <a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=7d2b06ad-cac7-4afc-b7af-0552fe30b6ac">Do you minimize your Outlook Distractions?</a>​. You have made the decision to read your emails, so email is in actual fact far more polite than IM which can be a nuisance. <br></p><p>IM is only to be used if they would like you to do something NOW.</p> </span>

<p><b>Tip&#58;</b> If someone pings&#160;you on IM (Teams / Skype) for non-urgent tasks, call the person out gently and let them know&#58; &quot;Since I don’t need to do this today, maybe an email would be better&quot;.<br></p>
