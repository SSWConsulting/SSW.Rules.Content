<span class='intro'> <p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">​<img src="/PublishingImages/display-your-company-name.jpg" alt="Display your company name" style="margin&#58;5px;" />&#160;</p><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureNormal">​​Figure&#58; Display your company name and location<br></dd><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P"></p>Using your company name as part of your Display Name has the double advantage of firstly&#160;​branding, and secondly, indicating to other parties that your IM account is for work purposes.<div><br>And be aware that while you can change your display name, Skype doesn't allow you to rename the account... So use your full name. I say this because if you just use &quot;Peter&quot;, then I can't distinguish you from the 3 other Peters I have.</div><div><br>Note&#58; One of the common questions is &quot;Where are you?&quot;</div><div><br>You can avoid this by putting the square brackets where you currently are eg. [SSW Brisbane] or [Cisco Melbourne]</div><div><br>The other common question is &quot;What are you doing?&quot;</div><div><br>You can also avoid this by putting the product name you are currently working on e.g. &quot;SSW Exchange Reporter&quot; in the personal message section of your Skype name. This can be easily changed, without having to go into your options, at the top of the Skype display.​<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P"><br></p></div> </span>
