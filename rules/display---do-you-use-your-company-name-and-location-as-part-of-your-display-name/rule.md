<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>Be aware that while you can change your display name, Skype doesn't allow you to rename the account... So use your full name. If you just use "Peter", then people​ can't distinguish you from the 3 other Peters they have.</p><p><b>Tip: </b>If you travel around people often will ask you<b></b> "Where are you?"<br>You can avoid this by putting the square brackets where you currently are. E.g. [SSW Brisbane] or [Cisco Melbourne]<br></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Related rule​​<br></h3><p><a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=f8ac3470-fc41-46db-97c3-35b8892e77d9">Do you use your personal message to share good news with your contacts?</a><br></p>
