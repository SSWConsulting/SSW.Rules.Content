<dt><img src="/PublishingImages/display-your-company-name.jpg" alt="Display your company name" /></dt><dd> Figure&#58; Display your company name and location<br></dd></dl><p>Using your company name as part of your Display Name has the double advantage of firstly branding, and secondly, indicating to other parties that your IM account is for work purposes.​<br>​<br></p> </span>

<p>Be aware that while you can change your display name, Skype doesn't allow you to rename the account... So use your full name. I say this because if you just use &quot;Peter&quot;, then I can't distinguish you from the 3 other Peters I have.</p><p><strong>Note&#58;&#160;</strong>One of the common questions is &quot;Where are you?&quot;</p><p></p><p>You can avoid this by putting the square brackets where you currently are eg. [SSW Brisbane] or [Cisco Melbourne]</p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">The other common question is &quot;What are you doing?&quot;</h3>You can also avoid this by putting the product name you are currently working on e.g. &quot;SSW Exchange Reporter&quot; in the personal message section of your Skype name. This can be easily changed, without having to go into your options, at the top of the Skype display.<p><br></p>
