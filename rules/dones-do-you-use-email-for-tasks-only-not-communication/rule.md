Email is a very powerful business tool. The main problem, however, is that for most people it is out of control - emails build up until they are impossible to manage. To help minimize mailbox clutter, try these tips: 

<!--endintro-->

* Send emails that contain clear tasks, not banter
* If an email you receive is not clear, phone the sender and ask for clarification, then document it in a follow-up email “As per our conversation…”. Too many people reply by email asking for more information, which wastes time and does not guarantee a response.
* If you speak to them, follow this rule: [Do you seek clarification via the telephone first?](/do-you-seek-clarification-via-the-telephone-first)
* If you can't get through, follow this rule: [Do you chase your Product Owner before he has to chase you?](/do-you-chase-your-manager-before-he-has-to-chase-you-e-g-asking-for-clarification)

Using your mailbox as a task list also saves you from having to use inefficient paper-based cards to track your tasks.

### Hi Mark,

Figure: Bad Example - A bad email is one that gives no clear action items and will probably lead to a back and forth thread (potentially with people misunderstanding each other)

**Tip 1:** It is better when email is not used as your first choice for communication. Of course, if the person is unavailable, you may have to. In this case, also follow the "[as per our conversation](/do-you-send-as-per-our-conversation-emails)" rule 
E.g. "As per the message I left on your phone... I want to make a decision on... My suggestions is..." and detail the questions you would like answered.

**Tip 2:** Make sure to number your tasks, if there is more than one, as per "[Do you number small tasks related to 1 topic](/number-tasks-questions)?"
