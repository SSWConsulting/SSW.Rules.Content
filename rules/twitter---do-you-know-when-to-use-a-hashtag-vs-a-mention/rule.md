<span class='intro'> <div><b>​#Hashtags</b> are used when talking about something – a topic or keyword. Using a hashtag creates a link that leads to a page displaying an aggregated list of posts about that thing.&#160;<br></div><div><br></div><div>On the other hand, <b>@Mentions</b> are used when talking to or about someone (the user account of a person, brand, group, etc.). The link created by a mention goes to that user account. The user is notified when they have received a mention in a post so that they can respond.​<br><br></div> </span>

<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">The best tweets will use a combination of @mentions and #hashtags where appropriate to properly leverage the platform – that way readers can check out the people involved OR join the conversation about a topic. <br>​<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-P"></p><dl class="image"><dt> <img src="tweet-with-mentions-and-hashtags.png" alt="hashtag-stream.jpg" style="width&#58;590px;" /> </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Figure&#58; This tweet utilises @mentions, #hashtags, and an external link, which will create higher engagement and let the reader further explore the topic<br></dd></dl> <p>
   <span style="line-height&#58;20px;"><strong>Small companies&#58;<br></strong></span><span style="line-height&#58;20px;">If the brand is not big you don't need it diluted. So find the&#160;profile and use the @ not the #<br></span><span style="line-height&#58;20px;">E.g.&#160;@firebootcamp is preferred over #firebootcamp&#160;</span></p><div>
   <strong>Large companies&#58;</strong></div><div>If the brand is big, you will see a difference between the @ and the #. So if you want to tweet about a subject that is also a username – such as #VisualStudio / @VisualStudio - then the content of your tweet will decide whether to use a hashtag or a @mention&#58;&#160;</div><div><ul><li>
         <span style="line-height&#58;20px;">If you are talking to someone directly, or mention a specific user in your tweet, you should use the @mention.<br></span><span style="line-height&#58;20px;background-color&#58;initial;">E.g. Thanks to @visualstudio for the map to Bill Gates’s house – I’m looting his safe right now!</span></li><li>
         <span style="line-height&#58;20px;"></span></li><li>
         <span style="line-height&#58;20px;">If it is about the topic, then the hashtag is the way to go.<br></span><span style="line-height&#58;20px;">E.g. Microsoft releases #VisualStudio 2013 Update 2 </span></li></ul></div>
