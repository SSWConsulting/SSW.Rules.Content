**#Hashtags** are used when talking about something – a topic or keyword. Using a hashtag creates a link that leads to a page displaying an aggregated list of posts about that thing. 





On the other hand,  **@Mentions** are used when talking to or about someone (the user account of a person, brand, group, etc.). The link created by a mention goes to that user account. The user is notified when they have received a mention in a post so that they can respond.



<!--endintro-->

The best tweets will use a combination of @mentions and #hashtags where appropriate to properly leverage the platform – that way readers can check out the people involved OR join the conversation about a topic.

**Small companies:
** If the brand is not big you don't need it diluted. So find the profile and use the @ not the #
E.g. @firebootcamp is preferred over #firebootcamp

**Large companies:** 

If the brand is big, you will see a difference between the @ and the #. So if you want to tweet about a subject that is also a username – such as #VisualStudio / @VisualStudio - then the content of your tweet will decide whether to use a hashtag or a @mention: 


* If you are talking to someone directly, or mention a specific user in your tweet, you should use the @mention.
E.g. Thanks to @visualstudio for the map to Bill Gates’s house – I’m looting his safe right now!
* 
* If it is about the topic, then the hashtag is the way to go.
E.g. Microsoft releases #VisualStudio 2013 Update 2
