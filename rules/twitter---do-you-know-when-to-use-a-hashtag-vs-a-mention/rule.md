<div>​​Hashtags (#) are used when talking about something – a topic or keyword. Using a hashtag creates a link that leads to a page displaying an aggregated list of posts about that thing.&#160;</div><div><br></div><div>On the other hand, @mentions are used when talking to or about someone (the user account of a person, brand, group, etc.). The link created by a @mention goes to that user account. The user is notified when they have received a @mention in a post so that they can respond.&#160;</div><div><br></div>

<p><span style="line-height&#58;20px;"><strong>Small companies/topics&#58;<br></strong></span><span style="line-height&#58;20px;">If the brand is big you don't need it diluted. So use the @ not the #<br></span><span style="line-height&#58;20px;">eg. &#160;@firebootcamp is preferred over #firebootcamp&#160;</span></p><div><strong>Large companies/topics&#58;</strong></div><div>If the brand is big you will see a difference between the @ and the #. So if you want to tweet about a subject that is also a username – such as #VisualStudio / @VisualStudio - then the content of your tweet will decide whether to use a hashtag or a @mention&#58;&#160;</div><div><ul><li><span style="line-height&#58;20px;">If you are talking to someone directly, or mention a specific user in your tweet, you should use the @mention.<br></span><span style="line-height&#58;20px;background-color&#58;initial;">Eg. Thanks to @visualstudio for the map to Bill Gates’s house – I’m looting his safe right now!</span></li><li><span style="line-height&#58;20px;"></span></li><li><span style="line-height&#58;20px;">If it is about the topic, then the hashtag is the way to go.<br></span><span style="line-height&#58;20px;">Eg. Microsoft releases #VisualStudio 2013 Update 2​</span></li></ul></div>
