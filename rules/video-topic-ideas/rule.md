To keep your video content relevant and aligned with your business goals, it's crucial to revisit your marketing strategy regularly. One effective approach is to brainstorm new video topic ideas every three months based on your existing strategy. This helps ensure that your content stays fresh, targeted, and continues to engage your audience.
