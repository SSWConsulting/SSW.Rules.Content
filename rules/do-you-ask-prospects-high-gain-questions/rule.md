<span class='intro'> <p>Getting the right information from prospects helps you prioritize potential leads and projects and won't have you running around unnecessarily after hot air.</p><p>High-gain questions allow you to get information that otherwise won't necessarily be provided. Important information isn't often volunteered by smart prospective clients.<br></p> </span>

<p>First of all, you've got to ask because if you don't ask, you don't get. For example, &quot;if everything in the proposal was ok, what date were you thinking of starting the project?&quot; Such a simple question like that avoids spending priority time on clients who weren't thinking of starting the project until the next year!<br></p><p>If a client is reluctant to answer simple questions, a good way of eliciting a response is to provide options for them to choose. For example &quot;if everything in the proposal was ok, would you kick this project off next week, or next month, or later&#160;in&#160;the year?&quot;, or &quot;ok, so you don't have a set budget but what kind of ballpark were you thinking of, $25k, $150k or $300k?&quot;</p><p>If you ask a prospect a question, you should patiently wait for the answer. If you jump in with an answer before they do you've saved them from having to answer the question themselves.&#160; ​<br></p>
