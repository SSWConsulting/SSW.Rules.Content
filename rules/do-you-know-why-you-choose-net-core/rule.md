So developers can code on their operating system of choice using Visual Studio, Visual Studio for Mac or Visual Studio Code, working on the same code base as developers on a different operating system, and best of all they can also deploy to Linux.<h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Performance<br></h3>.NET Core is fast, and you get that performance out of the box.<br> </span>
