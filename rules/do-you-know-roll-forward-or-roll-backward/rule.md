In software development, deciding whether to **roll forward** or **roll backward** during deployments is crucial for maintaining system stability. This rule provides detailed scenarios to help determine the best strategy for handling deployment issues.

#### Rolling Forward
Rolling forward involves moving ahead with a new deployment or update, even if issues arise. The aim is to quickly apply a fix or additional update to resolve any problems caused by the initial deployment.

##### Scenarios for Rolling Forward:
- **Minor Issues:** If the deployed update has minor issues that can be quickly fixed with subsequent patches.
  - **Scenario:** A new feature is released with a minor UI bug that does not affect core functionality. The development team can deploy a quick patch within hours.
- **Emergency Fixes:** When the new deployment includes critical features or fixes that are necessary for the business.
  - **Scenario:** A security vulnerability is discovered, and an immediate patch is deployed to fix the issue, even though it introduces a few minor bugs.
- **Minor Issues:** If the deployed update has minor issues that can be quickly fixed with subsequent patches.
  - **Scenario:** A new feature is released with a minor UI bug that does not affect core functionality. The development team can deploy a quick patch within hours.
- **Minor Issues:** If the deployed update has minor issues that can be quickly fixed with subsequent patches.
  - **Scenario:** A new feature is released with a minor UI bug that does not affect core functionality. The development team can deploy a quick patch within hours.
- **Minor Issues:** If the deployed update has minor issues that can be quickly fixed with subsequent patches.
  - **Scenario:** A new feature is released with a minor UI bug that does not affect core functionality. The development team can deploy a quick patch within hours.
