<span class='intro'> <p>The corner stone of good user interface design is that if your users need instructions, you haven't done a good job. Of course with particularly complex applications there will be exceptions to this rule, but all developers should aim to make your interface as self-evident as possible.<br></p> </span>

   </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Good Example - See the fly? (an example of excellent usability) Dutch manufacturers realized that a fly painted on the urinal became a &quot;target&quot; for men using the facility. And the fly is positioned in precisely the right place for minimal spillage or splash back. Clever people those Dutch!</dd></dl>
