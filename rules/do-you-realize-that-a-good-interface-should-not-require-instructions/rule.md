The corner stone of good user interface design is that if your users need instructions, you haven't done a good job. Of course with particularly complex applications there will be exceptions to this rule, but all developers should aim to make your interface as self-evident as possible.

* There are no surprises
* There is no need to use help
* No excuse for RTFM (read the freaking manual)

A good UI is:

* Intuitive
* Feels fast e.g. no white screen, threading code
* Consistent
* Minimal popups
* No clutter - not busy
* Good error handling
* Easy to customize + apps (aka a platform)
* Gamification e.g. badges

   &lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: Good Example - See the fly? (an example of excellent usability) Dutch manufacturers realized that a fly painted on the urinal became a "target" for men using the facility. And the fly is positioned in precisely the right place for minimal spillage or splash back. Clever people those Dutch!</dd></dl>
