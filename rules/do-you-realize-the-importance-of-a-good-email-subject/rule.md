<span class='intro'> ​​Just as we should not 'judge a book by its cover' - we will not judge an email by its subject. But, we do! Because users get so many emails, getting your clients and suppliers to take notice of yours&#160;in their inbox can be quite a struggle. <br> </span>

<dl class="goodImage"><dt> <img alt="Outlook Choose an interesting subject" src="Outlook_ChooseAnInterestingSubject.gif" />​​​ </dt><dd>Figure&#58;&#160;Good Example - I'm definitely going to read this email</dd></dl><p>Use the email Subject to grab your recipient's attention. Choosing the right subject can give an email a sense of urgency or importance that choosing the wrong subject won't!</p><p>The best way of doing this is to ensure that your subject includes either an ACTION POINT (e.g. 6.30 TONIGHT! See you at The Oaks Hotel...) or a RESULT of a task you were asked to do (e.g. Here's the 5 mins. of FEEDBACK you requested from our meeting with Charles Merton). You'll note from this that including the date and time in the subject gives immediacy to the email.</p><p>If there's anything to be learned from spammers, they know how to get your attention. Spammers use very tabloid based, or headline-grabbing subjects, to try and coerce you to open that email. But don't make your email subjects tabloid-tacky, instead follow a good broadsheet paper's style of attention-grabbing lines.</p><p>Never leave the subject blank! It's like writing a book and failing to give it a name!</p><table class="clsSSWTable" style="width&#58;493px;height&#58;428px;"><tbody><tr><td width="50%"><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureBad"> Bad Subject Examples<br></dd></td><td width="50%"><dd class="ssw15-rteElement-FigureGood"> Good Subject Examples<br></dd></td></tr><tr><td>Database</td><td>Northwind -&#160;Future - Meeting to get your software solution rolling, next Monday 2PM<br></td></tr><tr><td>Dinner</td><td>Dinner Tonight, 6.30PM at The Oaks</td></tr><tr><td>??</td><td>

   <strong>Figure&#58; Always use a descriptive email subject to make it easier to find later</strong></p><p>Of course, we also use a structured approach for emails - especially when sending them internally.</p><p>We use the following format for the subject internally and encourage clients and external contacts to use this format as well.</p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-GreyBox">[Client Name/Product Name] - [Project Name] – [Object Name/Description]<br>Eg.&#58; <b>WorleyParsons – IOP – Customer.aspx - Add email address validation</b></p><pre></pre><p>The advantage of this&#160;is that when you sort by the subject in Outlook, you get all of the emails grouped together, and it is easy to recognize the client/product, because the subject contains the&#160;relevant information.<br></p><p><b>Tip&#58; </b>When referring to a website, it's a good idea to include the URL in the email subject.<br></p><p>Additionally, you should be able to determine which emails are the most important. Using a meaningful subject with keywords makes it easy to identify and categorize emails without actually opening them (and it also makes it easy to find them in &quot;Sent Items&quot;). When emails are really important, write IMPORTANT in the subject. Other emails considered important or urgent should have the following in the subject field&#58;</p><ul><li>BUG<br></li><li>INCOMPLETE</li><li>URGENT</li></ul><p>Other words to be used are&#58;</p><ul><li>TIMESHEETS</li><li>INVOICES</li><li>PROSPECT</li><li>TO-DO - for tasks pending</li><li>FYI - information you want to keep around for a while, for yourself or for others (never for a task)</li><li>FUTURE - ideas for the future</li><li>IGNORE - for the rare occasion when something is requested and you really don't want to do it yet</li><li>Product name - Registered User Support​​​<br></li><li>Product name - Pre-Sales Support</li><li>Project name</li><li>Client Name</li></ul><div class="ms-rteCustom-GreyBox"><p>
      <strong>Remember&#58;</strong></p><p>For external emails, it is acceptable to <a title="When to Change an Email Subject" href="/Pages/WhenToChangeEmailSubject.aspx">change the email subject</a> in certain circumstances.</p><p>For internal emails, the subject line should generally&#160;not be changed as it will break the threading of emails.<br></p></div>
