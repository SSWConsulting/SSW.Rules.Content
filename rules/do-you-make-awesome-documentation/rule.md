      <b>Scrum Tip&#58; Update your Acceptance Criteria</b> - If you use a policy that requires commits to be linked to PBIs, then you understand that the PBI is now the documentation. If requirements change (based on a conversation with Product Owner of course) then the PBI should be updated.</p><p>When updating the Acceptance Criteria, <s>strike through</s> the altered Acceptance Criteria and add the new ones.

      <strong>What's &quot;Technical Debt&quot;?</strong></p><p>During a project, when you add functionality, you have a choice&#58;</p><p>One way&#160;is quick but messy - it will make further changes harder in the future (i.e. quick and dirty).</p><p>The other way is cleaner – it will make changes easier to do in the future&#160;but will take longer to put in place.<br></p><p>'Technical Debt' is a metaphor to help us think about this problem. In this metaphor (often mentioned during Scrum software projects), doing things the quick and dirty way gives us a 'technical debt', which will have to be fixed later. Like a financial debt, the technical debt incurs interest payments - in the form of the extra effort that we must&#160;do in future development.</p><p>We can choose to continue paying the interest, or we can pay the debt in full by redoing the piece of work in the cleaner way.</p><p>The same principle is true with documentation. Using the 'old school' method will leave you with a build-up of documentation that you will need to keep up to date as the project evolves.</p><p>Warning&#58; if you want to follow Scrum and have zero technical debt, then you must​ throw away all documentation at the end of each sprint. If you do want to keep it, make sure you add it to your <a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=6449ae79-ba88-447e-aa48-36173029a2af">definition of done </a>to keep it updated.</p></div>
