**Assumption:**

1. You have already installed the customized wsp package you know.
2. You have restored the content database to SQL server
3. You haven't attach the content database yet.


It is strongly recommend to run a pre-migration check on the content database before attaching it to trigger the migration process.

2. Run the command below



```
Test-SPContentDatabase - name WSS_Content_DB  - webapplication http://sitename
```
