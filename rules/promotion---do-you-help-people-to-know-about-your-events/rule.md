The most cost effective way is to use the large variety of online services that are available. </p><p><strong>Meetup</strong></p><p>This is the best way to increase discoverability of your event. Meetup provides the following and more&#58;</p><ul><li>Allows people to search and discover​</li><li>Allows people to join your group to get updates</li><li>You can easily list your upcoming events and have people join them</li><li>Comes with an automatic mailing list so you can send out announcements</li></ul><p><strong>Social Media</strong></p><p>In some circumstances it is worth setting up one or more accounts on social media for promoting and corresponding as the event identity. In technical circles it is especially popular to use Twitter as a way to create awareness about events. SSW use a combination of Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Instagram to promote our events,&#160;that way we have a much larger and diverse audience to draw from.​​<br></p><p class="ssw15-rteElement-Tip"><span style="font-size&#58;1rem;">TIP&#58; Get your staff to Tweet at events and to Re-Tweet your events to help reach a larger audience!&#160;​</span><span style="font-size&#58;1rem;">​</span><br></p><p><strong></strong><strong>Word of Mouth</strong></p><p>Don't underestimate the power of one friend or colleague telling another.

If you are creating a recurring event, word of mouth becomes extremely important as past experiences flow through the grapevine.</p>
