<span class='intro'> <p>
                    Swearing is not acceptable at SSW. For those who work at SSW and do not follow this
                    standard, we encourage them to do five push-ups or, alternatively, run outside and
                    back. If nobody paid attention to our standard, people would get comfortable with
                    bad language and the work environment would suffer.
                </p> </span>
