  <h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">​Do you need one?</h3>
<p>If an object can gather enough of a community willing to share a common interest, then a Facebook Like Page (was a Fan Page) is suitable.</p>
 </span>

<p>A<b> Like Page</b> should be available for each popular product or entity of your company. SSW has a page for the Rules section of our company but not for each individual product; on the other hand, it would be suitable for Microsoft to have a separate page for each of their products.</p><dl class="image"><dt><img alt="Facebook Like pages" src="Facebook_LikePage.jpg" /></dt><dd>Figure&#58; One of these Like Pages is probably unnecessary. </dd></dl>​
<p>Whether your product or entity requires a Like Page depends largely on how effectively it will reach your target audience. Such pages usually have a high upkeep as you need to spend time to maintain your public image, responding to comments and posting updates reliably. It can be a profitable maneuver, but if this style of social networking does not reach out to your audience, then maintaining it is needless. </p>
