  <p>Do you need one?</p>
<p>If an object can gather enough of a community willing to share a common interest, then a Facebook Like Page (was a Fan Page) is suitable.</p>

<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>

  <p>A Like Page should be available for each popular product or entity of your company. SSW has a page for the Rules section of our company but not for each individual product; on the other hand, it would be suitable for Microsoft to have a separate page for each of their products.</p>

<font class="ms-rteCustom-FigureNormal" size="+0">Figure&#58; One of these Like Pages is probably unnecessary. </font>
<p>Whether your product or entity requires a Like Page depends largely on how effectively it will reach your target audience. Such pages usually have a high upkeep as you need to spend time to maintain your public image, responding to comments and posting updates reliably. It can be a profitable maneuver, but if this style of social networking does not reach out to your audience, then maintaining it is needless. </p>
