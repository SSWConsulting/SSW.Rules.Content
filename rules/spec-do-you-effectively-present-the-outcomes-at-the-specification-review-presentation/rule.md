The findings of the Spec Review&#160;should be presented at a meeting with the key decision makers of the project for review and acceptance, generally in the form of a PowerPoint presentation. It is important that all the required people are in a room together to review the&#160;plan.

<p>If you've run the Spec Review successfully the client should not be surprised by anything you present. This means discussions should focus on issues such as what particular requirements could be added into the scope in the first phase, or what releases can be completed by what date, rather than spending the meeting helping the client regain consciousness after they blacked out from seeing the price.</p><p>The Spec Review presentation should be scheduled by the Project Manager or Account Manager for the afternoon of the final day of the Spec Review.&#160;<br><br><font class="ms-rteCustom-GreyBox" size="+0">“I will send you a proposal when I get back to the office.” </font>
