<span class='intro'> Sometimes, in order to add someone in to the loop on something, you might write an email and attach another email as reference material. <br>
Generally this is not a good idea and you are better off replying to the original email instead so you can keep it in the history of ongoing threads. 
 </span>

The exception is when you are already in a conversation thread with important history and you want to add more reference material to the email, although even then it's a good idea to also quote the particular line of interest as well.
