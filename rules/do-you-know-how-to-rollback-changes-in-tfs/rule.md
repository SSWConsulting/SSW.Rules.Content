This field should not be null (Remove me when you edit this field). 
<!--endintro-->

There are two ways to do this:1. If you haven’t checked in any files since you started modifying them then the process is simple:
    * Right click your solution and  **Undo Pending Changes** <img alt="Undo Pending changes" src="rollback1.gif" width="266" height="307"> 
2. If you aren’t so lucky and have made some commits along the way then the only option is to use the Rollback command.
    * To use this you will need to install [Team Foundation Server Power Tools v1.2](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Redirect/TFSPowerToolsDownload.htm) 
    * Find the revision before you started checking code in using the  **History command** <img alt="Revision List" src="rollback2.gif" width="595" height="178">
<dd>Figure: The last revision before Tristan made changes was 5367</dd>
    * Open the Command Prompt in your current working directory and type  **“c:\Program Files\Microsoft Team Foundation Server Power Tools\tfpt.exe” rollback /changeset:5367** <img alt="Rollback Changeset" src="rollback3.gif" width="807" height="342"> 
    * Click  **Yes** and the rollback will proceed


It would be nice if there was a GUI for this tool so that I can just right click and select rollback. See [Better Software Suggestion – TFS](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/BetterSoftwareSuggestions/TeamFoundationServer.aspx#RollbackGUI)
