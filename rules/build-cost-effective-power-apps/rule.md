### Effectiveness Rating

**Rating: 8/10**

This approach is highly effective for organizations looking to build customized applications while minimizing costs. However, it does require careful consideration of the missing advanced features and potential integration challenges. For many scenarios, especially where the advanced Dynamics 365 features are not critical, this approach provides a significant cost advantage with minimal compromise.
