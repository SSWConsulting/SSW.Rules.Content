<span class='intro'> ​<p>Inevitably, our well-engineered Angular ​application will need to send and receive data from a service of some sort – usually a Web API. A common mistake people make when doing this is using typescript’s built in <strong>any</strong> type for these services, which offers no type safety whatsoever.</p> </span>

<dl class="badImage"><dt> 
      <img alt="dtogs-bad.png" src="/PublishingImages/dtogs-bad.png" /> 
   </dt><dd>Figure&#58; Bad example - The &quot;any&quot; type is used as the DTO for this service. There is no type safety.</dd></dl><p>One step better is to manually create interfaces for the DTOs. This gives type safety, but still means a lot of manual, tedious work to generate the interfaces.</p><dl class="image"><dt> 
      <img alt="dtogs-ok.png" src="/PublishingImages/dtogs-ok.png" /> 
   </dt><dd>Figure&#58; OK example - Manually coded interface ensures any object passed to the service is in the correct format </dd></dl><p>But this still doesn’t give safety over-the-wire – if the server side model changes, a developer has to remember to update it here, and hope that there are no typos.&#160; This is also extra effort to perform something mindlessly repetitive – something a machine is much better at doing.&#160; And we are programmers, right?</p>If your WebAPI has an OpenAPI (a.k.a. Swagger) specification, then the NSwag&#160;tools&#160;can build a complete Typescript client configured as an Angular injectable service - complete with&#58;
