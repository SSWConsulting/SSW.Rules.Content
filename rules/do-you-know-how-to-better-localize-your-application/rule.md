Localization makes your web application ready to work more than one language — and it’s much easier if you do it from the beginning. Just follow these tips to better localize your application for a specific country or region.

* Set your application default language to automatically change to local language. For more information see "[Set your application default language](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=5aad1f7a-4872-439a-b248-6a151ba096f8)".
* Always give the user an option to change the locale and remember this choice for the future visits. For more information see "[Always give the user an option to change the locale](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=cdfaa8e8-772c-4ebe-a079-a15ee854357c)".
* Use client-side tools for localization as much as possible so that for the most part, the back end of your service remains unchanged. For more information see "[Use client-side tools for localization as much as possible](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=a4ba1bf2-9315-4611-9027-67d763702652)".
* Leave plenty of space for text expansion in other languages.
* Do not hardcode strings, instead you should move strings to resource files. For more information see "[Localize .NET applications with ease](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/features/internationalization.html)".
* Localize the date/number format.
* Avoid using images and icons that contain text in your application. They are difficult to localize.
* Provide numerous comments in application resources that define context. For more information see "[Provide numerous comments in application resources that define context](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=565bf34b-7435-44d4-b23d-430cb7732e25)".
* Get native speakers to test the application to make sure that the language reads properly and is true to the intent.
* Make sure that your social media presence covers the countries you have translated your application into. For more information see "[Definition of implementing social media campaigns](/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&TermId=867d8d4f-e050-448b-8d9a-a70507c84ed5)"
