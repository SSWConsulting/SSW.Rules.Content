Localization makes your web application ready to work more than one language — and it’s much easier if you do it from the beginning. Just follow these tips to better localize your application for a specific country or region.

* Set your application default language to automatically change to local language. For more information see "[Set your application default language](/do-you-set-your-application-default-language-to-automatically-change-to-local-language)".
* Always give the user an option to change the locale and remember this choice for the future visits. For more information see "[Always give the user an option to change the locale](/do-you-always-give-the-user-an-option-to-change-the-locale)".
* Use client-side tools for localization as much as possible so that for the most part, the back end of your service remains unchanged. For more information see "[Use client-side tools for localization as much as possible](/do-you-use-client-side-tools-for-localization-as-much-as-possible-2)".
* Leave plenty of space for text expansion in other languages.
* Do not hardcode strings, instead you should move strings to resource files. For more information see "[Localize .NET applications with ease](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/features/internationalization.html)".
* Localize the date/number format.
* Avoid using images and icons that contain text in your application. They are difficult to localize.
* Provide numerous comments in application resources that define context. For more information see "[Provide numerous comments in application resources that define context](/do-you-provide-numerous-comments-in-application-resources-that-define-context)".
* Get native speakers to test the application to make sure that the language reads properly and is true to the intent.
* Make sure that your social media presence covers the countries you have translated your application into. For more information see "[Definition of implementing social media campaigns](/do-you-follow-a-definition-of-social-media)"
