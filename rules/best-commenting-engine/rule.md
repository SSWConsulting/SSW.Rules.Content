If you have published content on the internet, it's a good idea to allow your visitors to comment and rate your pages. Collecting feedback is a great way to make it easier to maintain your content. You can see which content is out of date, and which content is more highly regarded by your user base. This lets you focus on creating the most relevant content that you can. As well as providing you with feedback, allowing people to participate makes them feel more engaged with your content, broadening your reach.

There are a few ways that you can easily add comments and interactivity, such as using widgets from:

* [Disqus](https&#58;//disqus.com/)
* [Yotpo](https&#58;//www.yotpo.com/)
* [Facebook](https&#58;//www.facebook.com/)
* [Twitter](https&#58;//twitter.com/)


The following video shows an overview of Yotpo ratings which we've implemented for our SSW Rules.
