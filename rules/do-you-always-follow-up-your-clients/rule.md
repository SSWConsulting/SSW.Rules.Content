If you have followed the previous rule and the ball is always in their court, you need to make sure that they keep playing.

The best way to do this is to make sure you follow up all communications that require a reply, whenever you feel that a bottleneck is forming.

The best ways to follow up a client are:

<!--endintro-->

* Use email  
  If there is no response, find the original email and resend.  
  See our Rules To Better Email
  * [Do you know how to hurry someone up?](/do-you-know-how-to-follow-up-an-unanswered-email)
  * [Do you always follow up your clients?](/do-you-follow-up-emails-effectively)
  * [Do you realize the importance of a good email Subject?](/do-you-realize-the-importance-of-a-good-email-subject)
* Use IM or Teams
  See our [Rules To Better Instant Messenger](/rules-to-better-im)
* Use the phone  
  Call them

**Tip:** You can use [FollowUpThen.com](https://www.followupthen.com/) for your follow up emails.

### Provide clear status updates when following up

When giving a status update to any stakeholder, avoid sending long paragraphs of feedback.  
Instead, summarise the points into short, clear, actionable items. This lets the recipient get the key information quickly without reading through extra details.

### Hi Jean

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; > 1. New Rule – Missing redirect  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating a rule:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I created a new rule  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hit “save” and waited for the branch to be created  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then nothing happened

I have created a PBI in the TinaCMS backlog, please check <https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/issues/6159>
