Npm packages often get new releases (adding new functionalities, fixing bugs or vulnerabilities). It is important to keep the packages updated as much as possible during the development of your application. The best way to do that is to update all the packages every time you add a new package to your application, and include the 'npm outdated' and 'npm audit' reports in the Sprint Review. These commands are also available with yarn with 'yarn outdated' and 'yarn audit'.

* 'npm outdated' returns an overview of your packages: the version, the wanted version (the maximum version of the package that satisfies the semver range specified in package.json) and the latest version of the package.

* 'npm audit' returns an audit on your packages for vulnerabilities. It also provides information on how to resolve them.
