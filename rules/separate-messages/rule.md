When messaging someone, it's often tempting to send a big block of text, instead of separating your thoughts into separate messages. But did you know that this can make your thoughts difficult to respond to?

### Why separate messages?

* **Clarity** - Separating your messages makes them easier to digest.
* **Reducing hassle** - The people you are messaging will be able to respond or interact with each message separately.

::: bad
Figure: Bad example - This message contains many different subjects! It's informative, but hard to read, and respond to.
