When messaging someone, it's often tempting to send a big block of text, instead of separating your thoughts into separate messages. But did you know that this can make your thoughts difficult to respond to?

### Why separate messages?

When you separate your messages, the people you are messaging will be able to respond or interact with each message separately!
