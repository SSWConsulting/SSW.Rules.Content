**Tip:** You can use ChatGPT to find a courteous and fun way to [correct somebody's mistake](/is-everyone-in-your-team-a-standards-watchdog).
:::

Here are examples of the prompting techniques on the cheat sheet:

## Give a role

::: greybox
_You are a... ü§ñ_
:::

ChatGPT can be given a role to understand the context of what it will need to do/know.

See some examples below:

::: greybox

_...writing coach: How can I improve the clarity and impact of this project proposal?"_

_...GitHub Actions expert: "What's the best way to set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions?"_

_...C# code reviewer: "Please review this C# code snippet for a new feature implementation."_

_...Copywriter: "Help me write a catchy headline for our new marketing campaign."_

_...{{ POSITION }} interviewer: "Act as a UX Designer interviewer and ask me 5 relevant questions."_
:::

## Some dos ‚úÖ

* For complex tasks, use: _"ask any questions needed for context"_

::: greybox
_"Design a new feature for our mobile app and ask me any questions for context."_
:::

* Tell it to _"be concise"_ or _"use bullet points"_

::: greybox
_"Summarize the benefits of using React in our project, and please be concise. Use bullet points with pros and cons."_
:::

* Set the tone for responses (e.g. professional, informal, funny)

::: greybox
Professional: _"Explain the importance of code reviews in a professional tone."_

Informal: _"In an informal tone, tell me why UX design matters for our app."_

Funny: _"Share a funny anecdote about a marketing campaign that went wrong."_
:::

## Some don‚Äôts ‚ùå

* Don't ask leading questions. Don‚Äôt anchor ChatGPT.

::: greybox
_‚ÄúIsn't Python the best language for this project?"_
:::
::: bad
Bad example
:::

::: greybox
_"What language would be best for this project and why?"_
:::
::: good
Good example
:::

* Don‚Äôt share confidential information with ChatGPT

According to Forbes, any data shared with ChatGPT could end up being leaked since the data becomes part of a collective database.

## The anatomy of a prompt - 5 prompts in 1 ü´Ä

It‚Äôs important to consider what a prompt is made up of. Here‚Äôs an example that breaks down the different components of a good prompt:

* **Role** - _You are a Software Developer._
* **Result** - _Create 5 email subjects._
* **Context** - _The email is to inform all the developers about a UX problem with search._
* **Intent** - _The goal is to get them to critique my YouTube video._
* **Constraint** - _Subject < 50 characters._

## Chain your prompts

Chain prompting is the technique of guiding GTP's responses by asking a series of related questions or prompts, building upon the previous answers to obtain more coherent and relevant information.

For an example on this, see: [Do you use chained prompting?](/chained-prompting)
