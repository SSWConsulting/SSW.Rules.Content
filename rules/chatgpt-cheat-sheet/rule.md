**Tip:** You can use ChatGPT to find a courteous and fun way to [correct somebody's mistake](/is-everyone-in-your-team-a-standards-watchdog).
:::

Here are examples of the prompting techniques on the cheat sheet: 

## Give a role

::: greybox
*You are a... ü§ñ* 
:::

ChatGPT can be given a role to understand the context of what it will need to do/know. 

See some examples below: 

::: greybox

*...writing coach: How can I improve the clarity and impact of this project proposal?"*

*...GitHub Actions expert: "What's the best way to set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions?"*

*...C# code reviewer: "Please review this C# code snippet for a new feature implementation."* 

*...Copywriter: "Help me write a catchy headline for our new marketing campaign."*

*...{{ POSITION }} interviewer: "Act as a UX Designer interviewer and ask me 5 relevant questions."*
:::

## Some dos ‚úÖ

* For complex tasks, use: *"ask any questions needed for context"* 

::: greybox
*"Design a new feature for our mobile app and ask me any questions for context."*
:::

* Tell it to *"be concise"* or *"use bullet points"* 

::: greybox
*"Summarize the benefits of using React in our project, and please be concise. Use bullet points with pros and cons."*
:::

* Set the tone for responses (e.g. professional, informal, funny)

::: greybox
Professional: *"Explain the importance of code reviews in a professional tone."* 

Informal: *"In an informal tone, tell me why UX design matters for our app."* 

Funny: *"Share a funny anecdote about a marketing campaign that went wrong."*
:::

## Some don‚Äôts ‚ùå

* Don't ask leading questions. Don‚Äôt anchor ChatGPT. 

::: greybox
*‚ÄúIsn't Python the best language for this project?"*
:::
::: bad
Bad example
:::

::: greybox
*"What language would be best for this project and why?"*
:::
::: good
Good example
:::

* Don‚Äôt share confidential information with ChatGPT   

According to Forbes, any data shared with ChatGPT could end up being leaked since the data becomes part of a collective database. 

## The anatomy of a prompt - 5 prompts in 1 ü´Ä

It‚Äôs important to consider what a prompt is made up of. Here‚Äôs an example that breaks down the different components of a good prompt: 

* **Role** - *You are a Software Developer.*  
* **Result** - *Create 5 email subjects.*
* **Context** - *The email is to inform all the developers about a UX problem with search.*  
* **Intent** - *The goal is to get them to critique my YouTube video.*  
* **Constraint** - *Subject < 50 characters.*

## Chain your prompts

Chain prompting is the technique of guiding GTP's responses by asking a series of related questions or prompts, building upon the previous answers to obtain more coherent and relevant information. 

For an example on this, see: [Do you use chained prompting?](/chained-prompting)
