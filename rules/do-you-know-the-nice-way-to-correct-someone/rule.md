<p>
                    When you notice that someone has done something against our standards, make sure
                    you are tactful in your corrections; especially if the person you are correcting
                    is a client.

                        FYI - an appointment would have been better. See rule #48 in <a href="/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/Pages/SendOutlookCalendarAppointmentsWhenAppropriate.aspx">

                        Hi Mary,<br>
                        <br>
                        I noticed you did not send an appointment for this meeting. I hope you don't mind,
                        but I have gone ahead and created one so we don't all have to create one individually.
                        <br>
                        We have a number of helpful standards like this which you can have a look at in
                        our <a href="/Communication/RulesToBetterEmail/Pages/SendOutlookCalendarAppointmentsWhenAppropriate.aspx">Rules to
                            better Email</a> if you're interested. </dt>
