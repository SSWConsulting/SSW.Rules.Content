When you notice that someone has done something that could have been done better, make sure you are tactful in your correction/suggestions. When you are giving someone a correction or tip, try to include an URL to back up your point.

For example, if someone sends you an email like that:

 **Subject: Meeting** 

Hi Guys,
 
Let's meet on Thursday at 3 PM

You could reply in different ways:

**Subject: RE: Meeting** 

Hi Mary,
 
FYI - an appointment would have been better. See rule #48 in [Rules to better Email](/appointments-do-you-send-outlook-calendar-appointments-when-appropriate)

**Subject RE: Meeting** 

Hi Mary,

I noticed you did not send an appointment for this meeting. I hope you don't mind, but I have gone ahead and created one so we don't all have to create one individually. 
We have a number of helpful standards like this which you can have a look at in our [Rules to better Email](/appointments-do-you-send-outlook-calendar-appointments-when-appropriate) if you're interested.
