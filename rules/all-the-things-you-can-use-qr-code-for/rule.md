Just as barcodes allow machines to read data from items in stores, QR codes are a barcode-like vector between online and offline information. QR codes can be easily accessed by any phone in the world that has a camera. They enable everything from online to offline (O2O) marketplaces, the latter being huge in China.

### 1. Use a QR code to follow a WeChat Business/Brand Account


Customers - WeChat allows users to follow a Business/Brand account upon scanning (using the built-in QR scanner). QR codes aren’t just used online, but also in a store or on business cards to save you typing in a URL.

Businesses - Followers of the WeChat Business/Brand accounts can be sent a limited number of messages per month, usually product info and promotions.

### 2. Use a QR code to share WeChat contact information

All WeChat users get their own customized QR code. It can be shown for anyone else to scan or share.

**Note:** QR codes can be scanned by tapping and holding on them.
