We recommend adding these menus to your Tools Menu:

- Tools - Validate code and links with [SSW Code Auditor](https://codeauditor.com)
- Tools - [Validate Data](/menu-do-you-include-a-tools-validate-data)
- Tools - Validate Reports with SSW Reporting Services Auditor
- Tools - [Run Unit Tests](/rules-to-better-unit-tests) (with NUnit)
- Tools - Validate PC with SSW Diagnostics
- Tools - View Application Errors with SSW Lady Log
