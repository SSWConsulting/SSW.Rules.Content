When a defect occurs in an office (e.g. a broken window, faulty air conditioning, or leaking tap), it’s crucial to report it with enough detail so that the Property Manager can take quick and accurate action. Many issues get delayed or mishandled because the initial report is missing key details like **location**, **urgency**, or **who has been informed**.

![](screenshot-2025-10-07-125246.png "Figure: what information should you include when reporting a defect")

Good reporting not only helps the Property Manager resolve issues faster, it also improves **turnaround time (TAT)**, **feedback**, and **follow-up communication**.  

<!--endintro-->

When reporting a defect, always make sure your message is **clear, complete, and actionable**.  

### Include the following key details:

1. **Location**\
   Start broad and zoom in:  

   * Office name → floor → area → exact item  
   * Example: “SSW Newcastle → Ground floor → Backlog area → Top right window”
2. **Urgency and Impact**  

   * Does the defect affect your productivity or safety?  
   * If yes, clearly state the impact (e.g. “Can’t use meeting room due to flickering lights”).  
   * Mention any **temporary fix** you’ve already applied (e.g. “Taped over the exposed wire until repaired”).
3. **Who You’ve Reported It To**  

   * Always include:  

     * The **Head of Office**  
     * The **Property Manager**  
   * Use @mentions if you’re reporting via Teams or email, e.g. “@John Smith @Sarah Jones”.
4. **Historic Information**  

   * Note any past occurrences or related maintenance (e.g. “Window was repaired in 2022 for the same issue”).
5. **Create a PBI (YakShave It)**  

   * For traceability, **create a PBI (Product Backlog Item)** in Azure DevOps titled “Defect – \[Brief Description]”.  
   * Link the PBI in your message so others can track progress and updates.  
   * Example: “Created PBI: [Defect – Broken window in backlog area](#)”

### Example of a good defect report

::: greybox
**Subject:** Broken window – SSW Newcastle, ground floor, the Backlog

**Details:**\
The top right window in the backlog area has a cracked pane.\
This may have been caused by recent strong winds.\
Currently not affecting productivity but could worsen if not fixed soon.\
Temporary fix: Moved desks away from the area.  

**Reported to:** @John Smith (Head of Office), @Sarah Jones (Property Manager)\
**Previous issue:** Window repaired in 2022 for similar damage.\
**PBI:** [Defect – Cracked window in backlog area](#)
:::
::: good
Figure: Good Example – Clear, complete, and includes all the essential details for fast action and tracking
:::

### Bad example – missing key details

::: greybox
“The window is broken.”\
:::
::: bad
Figure: Bad Example – Too vague; missing location, urgency, and who it’s reported to
:::

### Tip

Consistency in reporting helps ensure that all offices communicate defects in the same clear way — improving turnaround time, transparency, and accountability.

By following this rule and “YakShaving” each defect into a **PBI**, you help ensure property issues are logged, tracked, and resolved efficiently — saving time, reducing confusion, and improving everyone’s work environment.
