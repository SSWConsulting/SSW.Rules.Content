In the course of your employment, you may produce a number of videos for a project, a client, and/or for your profile.

<!--endintro-->

**For great videos that would help your company's YouTube presence**, it's best to upload them directly onto the **company YouTube channel** (e.g. [SSW TV channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBFgwtV9lIIhvoNh0xoQ7Pg)). There, you can have a playlist with your name in it, making it easier to find your videos over the years. These videos will help promote your profile, as well as the company's.

Every other video should go under **their own product channel** (e.g. [YakShaver](https://www.youtube.com/@SSWYakShaver) or [SugarLearning](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBFgwtV9lIIhvoNh0xoQ7Pg)).

For important clients, upload the videos under an extra channel for that client/project.

In rare cases, you may [put them on **your own YouTube channel** under a playlist](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/57792?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) called "Work - {{ COMPANY NAME }}". You can then look back to them a decade later fondly and see how much you have improved.
