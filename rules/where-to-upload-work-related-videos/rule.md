In the course of your employment, you may produce a number of videos for a project, a client, and/or for your profile.

<!--endintro-->

## Public company/product YouTube channel

Use the company/product YouTube channel for best practices content.

For cool videos that would help your company's YouTube presence, it's best to upload them **publicly onto the company YouTube channel** (e.g. [SSW TV channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBFgwtV9lIIhvoNh0xoQ7Pg)).

For videos related to a product, they should go under **their own product channel** (e.g. [YakShaver](https://www.youtube.com/@SSWYakShaver), [TinaCMS](https://www.youtube.com/c/tinacms) or [SugarLearning](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBFgwtV9lIIhvoNh0xoQ7Pg)).

**Tip:** Create a playlist with your name in it, making it easier to find your videos over the years. These videos will help promote your profile, as well as the company's.

## Unlisted company/product YouTube channel

For [“Done” videos](/record-a-quick-and-dirty-done-video) or content not intended for general audiences, upload them to the product or company YouTube channel as **unlisted**.

## Client YouTube channel

For important clients, upload the videos under an extra channel for that client external project.

## Personal YouTube channel

In rare cases, for trivial content, you may [put them on **your own YouTube channel** under a dedicated playlist](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/57792?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) called "Work - {{ COMPANY NAME }}". You can then look back to them a decade later fondly and see how much you have improved.
