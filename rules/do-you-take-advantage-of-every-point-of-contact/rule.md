Every point of contact that you have with your customers is a potential to sell them something, whether that be other products or services or even to sell the company as a whole by saying how great we are.

<!--endintro-->

Here are some examples of how we take advantage of every point of contact with our target market:

* At SSW we send a tech breakfast flyer with the invoices that we send via snail mail
* We give out SSW bags and flyers at our User Group
* Have advertisements at the bottom of our email footers
* All SSW staff wear SSW shirts when meeting with prospects/clients
* When we present at other events our slides are branded with the SSW logo


We think that it's the little things like this that may make the difference!
