If you start typing in the search box, you will see a dropdown with the main results that matches your query divided by type, prioritizing **Teams** and **Channels**:

::: info
**Tip:** Apart from the little heading, as per the image above, you can recognize a **Teams** result when it only shows up the title, while a **Channel** result shows the title with the name of the associated **Team** underneath.
:::

Once you hit "enter", you will be directed to **all** results, separated by **Messages**, **People**, and **Files** tabs:

::: info
**Tip:** After hiting "enter", to see the **Teams** and **Channels** results, simply click the search box again.
:::

You may use built-in filters to refine your search under each of the tabs:

::: info
**Important:** Even though Teams search gives you quick access to all your messages and documents; the search is scoped to **Teams only**, which means you cannot search for files hosted on SharePoint, OneDrive, other Office365 products (E.g. Delve/UserProfile), or external sources (E.g. sugarlearning.com).

When you need to do a more extensive search, it is advised to use [SharePoint search](/sharepoint-search) instead.
