Often while doing a task, you follow a process. If it's a repeatable task, it's important that the process is documented and up-to-date. Otherwise, the next person to do the task won't know the right thing to do.

<!--endintro-->

### When should you do it?
Document or update a process as soon as a change happens. Don't wait until the task is complete because it will likely be forgotten. 

If you are really under the crunch and your task is critically urgent (e.g. the production website is down), then send yourself an email to action the standard update later.

### Where should you do it?
Processes are usually stored in different places depending on the context they apply to.
- [Wiki or Repo](awesome-documentation) - If related to a project
- [PBIs](document-discoveries) - If related to a task being worked on
- [Rules](do-you-know-how-to-document-what-you-are-doing) - Generic public standards
- Intranet - Internal standards
- SugarLearning - Links to standards/rules + test knowledge
