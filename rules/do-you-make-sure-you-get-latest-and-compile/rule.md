As a developer, there are few things more frustrating than troubles compiling an application. It's amazing how often you can't simply Clone a repository (aka "Get Latest") and compile it. Too often the response from other developers is "it works on my machine". 

A good developer makes it easy to get a new project, compile it, and have a smooth "F5" experience.
