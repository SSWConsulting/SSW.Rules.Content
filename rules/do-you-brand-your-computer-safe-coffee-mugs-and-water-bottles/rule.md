<span class='intro'> <p>How often are you sitting at your desk typing away and have an open cup of tea or coffee or glass of water sitting right next to your computer? Do you know how much liquid it takes to kill your computer? The answer is not much; some of our developers found this out the hard way and on more than one occasion. There is an alternative though, which if in the event spillages occur limits the amount of liquid being released. Travel safety mugs and sports water bottles are a great way of protecting your computer from unwanted damage from spillage.</p><p><span style="color&#58;#000000;font-family&#58;verdana, sans-serif;font-size&#58;12px;line-height&#58;17px;">They also make a fantastic gift to clients, which is an opportunity for you to have a constant reminder of your business in their face and their clients.</span><br></p> </span>

<p>G<span style="color&#58;#000000;font-family&#58;verdana, sans-serif;font-size&#58;12px;line-height&#58;17px;">ive your clients&#160;branded Travel&#160;Mugs and Sports Water Bottles as a way of saying thanks to our clients for engaging our services.
