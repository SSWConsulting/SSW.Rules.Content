<strong>Tips&#58;</strong>
<ol>
    <li>Think of a piece of the code that will be in the answer</li>
    <li>Include the company name if possible </li>

    <li>Use quotation marks when you're searching for an exact string </li>
    <li>Include the technology used if appropriate</li>
</ol>
<p>If someone asks you for help searching, always tell them the keywords - that will help them learn to search better.</p>

If you search on the key words 'Australia' and 'news' you wont find it on the first page, but if you add 'Sydney' (a word from the company name) then you're number 1... </p>
