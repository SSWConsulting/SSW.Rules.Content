<dl class="badImage">&lt;dt&gt;

   &lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: Bad example - it's not clear which are good and bad points </dd></dl><dl class="goodImage">&lt;dt&gt;
      <img src="TicksGood.jpg" alt=""> 
   &lt;/dt&gt;<dd>Figure: Good example - It's far more obvious which ones are the good points and which are the bad </dd></dl>
