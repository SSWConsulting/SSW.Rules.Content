For a better visual **across all your social media accounts,**, you should follow the standards that each platform requests. 

They have variations of sizes according to the placement, for example, banner, profile icon or a post. If you are creating an image for an advertising campaign on Facebook, they will offer you a hand full of placement options, like news feed, Facebook marketplace, video feeds, right column and many others.
