Swearing is not acceptable at work. People should not get comfortable with bad language as the work environment would suffer. You should be especially careful when giving and receiving feedback.

Some good deterrents are:

* A swear jar
* To enforce 10 push-ups for every infraction (recommended). 
This is the same concept as a swear jar but also promotes fitness.
