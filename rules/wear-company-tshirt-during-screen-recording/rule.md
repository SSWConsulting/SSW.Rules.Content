When recording your screen, whether for a tutorial, a webinar, or a demo, your on-camera appearance is just as important as the content itself. Wearing a company-branded t-shirt not only enhances your professional presence but also reinforces your company’s identity with every video you create.

## Why wear a company t-shirt?

* **Brand recognition** – Every video you record is an opportunity to strengthen brand visibility
* **Professionalism** – A branded shirt shows that your company values quality and consistency
* **Trust and credibility** – Audiences perceive a well-branded presenter as more authoritative
* **Consistency** – Helps maintain a uniform look across all videos, making your brand more recognizable

## When should you wear it?

You should always wear your company t-shirt when:

* Recording tutorials or educational content
* Creating product demos or walkthroughs
* Hosting webinars or live streams
* Appearing in customer-facing videos for your website or social media

However, if the video is for a formal corporate audience, consider dressing appropriately while still maintaining a polished and professional look.

### Bonus Tip: Make sure your logo is visible

When recording, ensure that:

* The camera angle clearly shows the company logo
* The t-shirt is clean and in good condition
* The background and lighting don’t overshadow your appearance

By consistently wearing your company t-shirt during screen recordings, you turn every video into a branding opportunity while ensuring a professional and polished presence.
