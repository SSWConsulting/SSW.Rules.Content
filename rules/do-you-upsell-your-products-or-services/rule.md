<span class='intro'> <p></p><h3>#1 When selling a product, upsell your most valuable service</h3><p>Most prospects come to your organization to seek a solution to a problem or need. By doing so, they place a certain amount of trust in you and your judgments. They trust that you can alleviate their problems, address their needs and sometimes suggest an alternative plan of action.<br></p><p>Say you are talking to a customer having problems with a product e.g.&#160;Upsizing PRO!&#160;- if they are still having problems with upsizing to SQL Server, they probably need some help beyond what our program can provide.&#160;Therefore tell them about how SSW has upsized smoothly for many clients and that we can help them. Though this example may not come across as an up-sell, little suggestions like these&#160;can bring in&#160;more consulting&#160;plus&#160;it shows that you're on the ball and looking out for your&#160;customers'&#160;needs.&#160;</p><p>Customers normally appreciate this sentiment. You need to remember that prospects don't always know exactly what they want or need and that's exactly why they've gone to the experts - ​YOU.</p>

(From there the client should be massaged until the new work booked in).<br></p>
