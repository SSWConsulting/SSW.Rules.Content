Excess punctuation without purpose can make a document or web content look unnecessarily busy. It adds unexpected visual clutter, especially in short or standalone text like **list items**, **captions**. For **URLs**, the reason is not just visual - adding a period at the end can break the link when it's copied or clicked.

<!--endintro-->

## List items

Bullet points should be short and sharp, and should generally **not** require full stops at all.

::: greybox

* Sentence one.
* Sentence two.
* Sentence three.

:::
::: bad
Figure: Bad example - Too much punctuation
:::

::: greybox

* Sentence one
* Sentence two
* Sentence three

:::
::: good
Figure: Good example - Clean with no full stops
:::

## Captions

Image captions should be short and sharp, and should generally **not** require full stops at all.

::: greybox

{{ IMAGE }}\
**Figure: A group of people in a meeting room.**

### What about multiple sentences in one element?

If your bullet point or caption has more than one sentence, consider rephrasing it, or using a different separator - like a dash; you could also consider a semicolon instead.

However, if it **is necessary** to have more than one sentence in these items (should be rare) a full stop is needed. In this case, you should end with a full stop for consistency and completeness.

::: info
**Reminder:** The rest of figure captions and the bullet points on content **should not have full stops**.

::: greybox

{{ IMAGE }}\
**Figure: A group of people in a meeting room. They appear to be engaged in a discussion**

* Sentence one
* Sentence two. Sentence three
* Sentence four. Sentence five. Sentence six
* Sentence seven

:::
::: bad
Figure: Bad example - A multi-sentence item becomes a mini-paragraph - not ending it with a full stop looks inconsistent
:::

* Sentence one
* Sentence two. Sentence three.

* Sentence seven

## URLs

[Descriptive links](/descriptive-links) are recommended whenever possible, but if you must display the raw URL, remember to avoid adding a full stop at the end, as it can break the link when copied or clicked.
