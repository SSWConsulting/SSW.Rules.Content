<p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">​​Once you’ve internalized the importance of <a href="/_layouts/15/FIXUPREDIRECT.ASPX?WebId=3dfc0e07-e23a-4cbb-aac2-e778b71166a2&amp;TermSetId=07da3ddf-0924-4cd2-a6d4-a4809ae20160&amp;TermId=34f9f173-8437-448d-a204-4ba07cdbe188">having Professional Integrity</a>, you may feel like you are suddenly under a lot of pressure to keep your word, and this can be stressful.<br></p>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>There are many tools​ and techniques you can use to help​​​ you succeed at this, and also to take some of the pressure off.​</p><h2><br></h2><h2>​Remembering to do something​​​​</h2><p>Trying to keep al​l your commitments in your head is difficult and stressful, but if you use systems that offload them, you can free up mental power to get things done in the meantime.​<br></p><h3>Siri (or Google) reminders</h3><p>Generally used for small tasks that you can't complete right now. These are very quick to set, and so won’t interrupt your flow.</p><p>Make sure you never dismiss these when they come up unless you can complete the task on the spot. If you can’t complete the task immediately when it appears on your lock screen, press and hold to kick the can down the road to when you will have time to do the task.​​​</p>
