<span class='intro'> <p class="ssw15-rteElement-P">There are so many open-source platforms for making the front-end web application development easier, some people like Angular, some people like React. Let us take a look at the benefits of React.​<br></p> </span>

<h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">Simplicity</h3><p> ReactJS is just simpler to grasp right away. The component-based approach, well-defined lifecycle, and use of just plain JavaScript make React very simple to learn, build a professional web (and mobile applications), and support it. React uses a special syntax called JSX which allows you to mix HTML with JavaScript. This is not a requirement; Developers can still write in plain JavaScript but JSX is much easier to use.</p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">​​Easy to learn</h3><p> Anyone with a basic previous knowledge in programming can easily understand React while Angular and Ember are referred to as&#160;<em>Domain specific Language</em>, implying that it is difficult to learn them. For React you just need basic knowledge of CSS and HTML.</p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">​​Native Approach</h3><p> React can be used to create mobile applications (React Native). And React is a diehard fan of reusability, meaning extensive code reusability is supported. So at the same time we can make IOS, Android and Web applications.</p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">​​​Data Binding</h3><p> React uses one-way data binding and an application architecture called Flux controls the flow of data to components through one control point – the dispatcher. It's easier to debug self-contained components of large ReactJS apps.</p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">​Performance</h3><p> React does not offer any concept of a built-in container for dependency. You can use Browserify, RequireJS, EcmaScript 6 modules which we can use via Babel, ReactJS-di to inject dependencies automatically.</p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">​Testability</h3><p> ReactJS applications are super easy to test. React views can be treated as functions of the state, so we can manipulate state we pass to the ReactJS view and take a look at the output and triggered actions, events, functions, etc.</p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">​Great Developer Tools</h3><p> Developer toolset is another important factor when you are choosing a development platform. There are 2 great tools you should be aware of&#58;&#160;<strong>React Developer Tools</strong>&#160;and&#160;<strong>Redux Developer Tools.</strong>&#160;Both can be installed as Chrome extensions.<br></p><h3 class="ssw15-rteElement-H3">References​<br></h3>
