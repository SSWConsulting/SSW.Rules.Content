​Imagine this scenario... Mary notices a small error on a page in her intranet.&#160;She is a good employee... She fires up an email and reports the spelling error to info@s*w.com.au. As she sends it she says to herself &quot;That it took more time to report the error than it would have taken me to fix it&quot;.<br>
<br><excerpt class='endintro'></excerpt><br>
<p>Small&#160; errors should be fixed by the person who found it. Text changes can be easily done in SharePoint or WordPress. If you know who is the culprit, it might be a good idea do inform that person, including the things you have fixed.<br></p>
