It's go time - teams have been allocated and the day has arrived.

**Tip:** This agenda can change depending on how many people are attending. E.g. If you have fewer people attending, you could start presentations earlier.

Ensure this is sent out to all staff months before the event to encourage ideas.

### Hi All,

I’m really excited about our Brainstorming Day! I hope you’re all thinking about what you would like to work on.

To prepare for our Brainstorming Day, send Adam, Matt W, William, Piers, and Brady something that you would like to work on as a group.
E.g. Our awesome SophieBot project came out of the Melbourne Brainstorming session last year.

**Tip:** A Done Video can help explain and sell your idea to other attendees ⭐
