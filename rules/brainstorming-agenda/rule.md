Its go time - teams have been allocated and the day has arrived.

**Tip:** This agenda can change depending on how many people are attending. E.g. If you have less people attending, you could start presentations earlier.

Ensure this is sent out to all staff months before the event to encourage ideas.

### Hi All,

I’m really excited about our Brainstorming day! I hope you’re all thinking about what you would like to work on.

To prepare for our Brainstorming day, send Adam, Matt W, William, Piers and Brady something that you would like work on as a group.
E.g. Our awesome SophieBot project came out of the Melbourne Brainstorming Session last year.

Tip: A Done Video can help explain and sell your idea to other attendees ⭐

**Agenda** (copied from [https://ssw.com.au/rules/brainstorming-agenda](/brainstorming-agenda))

- **8:00 am** - 🤝 Meet at the Brainstorming venue - we will have breakfast ready and order coffees

- **9:00 am** - 🧑‍💻 Start working on your project
- **1:00 pm** – 🍴 Lunch

- **2:30 pm** - 🧪 Do Test Please then a [tech check](/tech-check) with the TV team (The recording is more important than the live audience, working with mics is also great practice for when you are on site with a client)

- **6:00 pm** – 🍻 The pub!

## Presentations

The presentations are a very important part of the brainstorming as they are sharing the outcomes of the idea with the stakeholders who can decide whether the ideas should be implemented or not.

To keep presentations consistent, use a template and ensure the following is covered:
1. Pain - What is the problem you are solving?
2. Potential solutions and a recommendation - How can we fix the problem?
3. Cost - how long is it going to take and how much will it cost?
4. Next steps - how can this solution be implemented?

In order to get through all the presentation in 1 day, allocate a strict schedule.

E.g.
Presentation Delivery: 7 Minutes
Audience Q&A: 3 Minutes
Adam’s Feedback: 3 Minutes
Changeover: The next group must be ready to go immediately!

If the team has a demo to share, get them to pre-record it and embed it into the PowerPoint. This will save time and ensure the demo goes smoothly.

### Run sheet
To help presentations run smoother, its a good idea to set up a [presentation run sheet](/presentations-runsheet) and then share it with the attendees on the day.

This could be in a GitHub Discussion, Microsoft Loop or Word Doc.
