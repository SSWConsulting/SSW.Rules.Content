<p>
                    When a user fails to sign in due to invalid email or 
     password, you might have the well intention of letting them 
     know by telling them exactly which one is invalid.
                </p><p>
                    However this is not secure. It makes it easier for bad guys 
     (e.g., hacker) to get access to your account and do 
     malicious things to the site and with your information.
                </p><p>
                    The more secure message should be 'Invalid email or 
     password'.
                </p>
