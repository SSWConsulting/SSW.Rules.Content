Here are my thoughts on a couple of product sites critiqued against our criteria.       The following are the first 3 things I look on a product site:

* Screenshots
* Testimonials
* Product Box


<!--endintro-->

[Total Access Analyzer](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Redirect/TotalAcccessAnalyzer.htm)

![](../../assets/Good.gif) The good points about the website:

* They have a user friendly left navigation bar allowing quick access to product specific information.
* There is heaps of information to be read if you choose to.
* I really like the "Convince Your Boss" section.
* I think the "Quick Tour" is good with heaps of detailed information.


![](../../assets/Bad.gif) The bad points about the website:

* Seems busy
* Took a while to find the screen shots - should be more obvious.
* A significant amount of reading is required to understand what the product will do for you.
* No links to product support or knowledge base.
* No screen shots.


[SQL Compare](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Redirect/SQLServer/SQLCompare.htm)

![](../../assets/Good.gif) The good points about the website:

* Aesthetically pleasant with a simple easy to read layout.
* Links are provided to more detailed information.
* Access to evaluation copy and help files.


![](../../assets/Bad.gif) The bad points about the website:

* Screen shots are given but what is the purpose of making them so small I have to click every single image.
* When you open up the first page you should see a quick summary of what the product will do for you. Such as the key features and benefits.
* No description of system requirements.
* No description of how it works.


[Rich Text Box](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Redirect/RichTextBoxEditor.htm)

![](../../assets/Good.gif) The good points about the website:

* They have a user friendly tool bar allowing quick access to product specific information.
* Testimonials standout.
* Feature section is good - Where appropriate information has been summarised or put into a table.
* Compact design all in one screen full with links for more detailed information and a good menu bar at the top.
* Links are used frequently for access to more detailed information.
* There is a screen shot with a really good online demo.
* A lot of effort has been taken to make this site look aesthetically very pleasing.


![](../../assets/Bad.gif) The bad points about the website:

* There are buttons in the top header which do nothing. I know now that is the intention but I think confusion should be avoided.
* A lot of advertising clutter leaving web surfers confused as to where to go next.


[SSW Code Auditor](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/)

![](../../assets/Good.gif) Good points:

* Outlines the problems that the program solves well
* Good feature overview
* Has box shot, giving the product some identity.
* Has links to further information about related technologies (e.g. regular expressions).


![](../../assets/Bad.gif) Bad points:

* Testimonial is meaningless
* Screenshot doesn't illustrate purpose of application
* Too much content on one page, with no easy way to get to a specific area. Much of the content doesn't need its own section, and could be condensed to simply enhance the feel of the site.
* No clear links to product knowledge base until the bottom of the page
* Section about FxCop could be put on a separate page, with a feature comparison table, which is then linked to with a navigation item. This content won't be of interest to many surfers. Those who do know FxCop will see the link and click through.
* Report demo should be made clearer. People want to see this.
