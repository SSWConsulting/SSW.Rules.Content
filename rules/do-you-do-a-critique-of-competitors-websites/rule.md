<span class='intro'> <p>
      Here are my thoughts on a couple of product sites critiqued against our criteria.
      The following are the first 3 things I look on a product site&#58;</p><ul><li>Screenshots</li><li>Testimonials</li><li>Product Box</li></ul> </span>

   <img src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/Good.gif" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;16px;" /> The good points about the website&#58;</p><ul><li>They have a user friendly left navigation bar allowing quick access to product specific information.</li><li>There is heaps of information to be read if you choose to.</li><li>I really like the &quot;Convince Your Boss&quot; section.</li><li>I think the &quot;Quick Tour&quot; is good with heaps of detailed information.</li></ul><p> 
   <img src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/Bad.gif" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;16px;" /> The bad points about the website&#58;</p><ul><li>Seems busy</li><li>Took a while to find the screen shots - should be more obvious.</li><li>A significant amount of reading is required to understand what the product will do for you.</li><li>No links to product support or knowledge base.</li><li>No screen shots.</li></ul><p> 
   <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Redirect/SQLServer/SQLCompare.htm" target="_blank">SQL Compare</a></p><p> 
   <img src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/Good.gif" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;16px;" /> The good points about the website&#58;</p><ul><li>Aesthetically pleasant with a simple easy to read layout.</li><li>Links are provided to more detailed information.</li><li>Access to evaluation copy and help files.</li></ul><p> 
   <img src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/Bad.gif" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;16px;" /> The bad points about the website&#58;</p><ul><li>Screen shots are given but what is the purpose of making them so small I have to click every single image.</li><li>When you open up the first page you should see a quick summary of what the product will do for you. Such as the key features and benefits.</li><li>No description of system requirements.</li><li>No description of how it works.</li></ul><p> 
   <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Redirect/Fileware2.htm" target="_blank">FTP Sync</a></p><p> 
   <img src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/Good.gif" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;16px;" /> The good points about the website&#58;</p><ul><li>Summarises the product benefit well in one short paragraph.</li></ul><p> 
   <img src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/Bad.gif" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;16px;" /> The bad points about the website&#58;</p><ul><li>Screen shot available but not on the first page.</li><li>They have all the changes from previous releases on the main page - would have been better to have a link - it is assuming that all visitors are existing users who are very familiar with all the feature which I doubt is the case.</li><li>Aesthetically dull, no pictures or branding incorporated.</li><li>Information is not organized in any logical structure that entices web surfers to purchase.</li><li>No system specifications outlined.</li><li>Lacks structure. When you open up the first page you should see a quick summary of what the product will do for you. Such as the key features and benefits.</li><li>When you open up the first page you should see a quick summary of what the product will do for you. Such as the key features and benefits.</li><li>No description of system requirements.</li><li>Combining it with a whole lot of other products - should have a dedicated page per product.</li></ul><p> 
   <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Redirect/RichTextBoxEditor.htm" target="_blank">Rich Text Box</a></p><p> 
   <img src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/Good.gif" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;16px;" /> The good points about the website&#58;</p><ul><li>They have a user friendly tool bar allowing quick access to product specific information.</li><li>Testimonials standout.</li><li>Feature section is good - Where appropriate information has been summarised or put into a table.</li><li>Compact design all in one screen full with links for more detailed information and a good menu bar at the top.</li><li>Links are used frequently for access to more detailed information.</li><li>There is a screen shot with a really good online demo.</li><li>A lot of effort has been taken to make this site look aesthetically very pleasing.</li></ul><p> 
   <img src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/Bad.gif" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;16px;" /> The bad points about the website&#58;</p><ul><li>There are buttons in the top header which do nothing. I know now that is the intention but I think confusion should be avoided.</li><li>A lot of advertising clutter leaving web surfers confused as to where to go next.</li></ul><p> 
   <a href="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/CodeAuditor/">SSW Code Auditor</a></p><p> 
   <img src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/Good.gif" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;16px;" /> Good points&#58;</p><ul><li>Outlines the problems that the program solves well</li><li>Good feature overview</li><li>Has box shot, giving the product some identity.</li><li>Has links to further information about related technologies (e.g. regular expressions).</li></ul><p> 
   <img src="http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/Images/Bad.gif" alt="" style="margin&#58;5px;width&#58;16px;" /> Bad points&#58;</p><ul><li>Testimonial is meaningless</li><li>Screenshot doesn't illustrate purpose of application</li><li>Too much content on one page, with no easy way to get to a specific area. Much of the content doesn't need its own section, and could be condensed to simply enhance the feel of the site.</li><li>No clear links to product knowledge base until the bottom of the page</li><li>Section about FxCop could be put on a separate page, with a feature comparison table, which is then linked to with a navigation item. This content won't be of interest to many surfers. Those who do know FxCop will see the link and click through.</li><li>Report demo should be made clearer. People want to see this.</li></ul>
