The R&D tax grant is very beneficial to growing companies doing innovative work. If you're considering R&D for your company, it's important to keep the right documents and follow the right steps in order to comply with Australian R&D requirements.

Each of the following rules are designed to ensure that the following items can be demonstrated in a submission for R&D Tax Incentives.

* What the Core Activity was
* What Knowledge Gap existed
* What hypothesis was being researched
* What experiments were performed, ie the results (including failed experiments)
* What new knowledge was gained, and
* What supporting activities were done to support the core research
