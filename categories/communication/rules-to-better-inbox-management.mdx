According to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/456500/daily-number-of-e-mails-worldwide/), 376 billion emails are sent per day in 2025. Emails can pile up quickly, and before you know it, your inbox becomes a mess. Keeping it under control helps you stay organized and professional.

Treat your inbox as a simple to-do list and regularly file or delete messages so it always reflects an accurate record of your work.

**Note:** Remember that emails are legal records and should be kept with care. Never permanently delete them, as they may be needed to confirm agreements, decisions, or conversations.
