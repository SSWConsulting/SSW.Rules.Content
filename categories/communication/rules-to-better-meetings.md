Meetings that lack efficiency frequently occur because:

- People are not prepared  
- There is a lot of discussion but no resulting "action items"  
- Rat holes - Time is wasted digressing to unrelated topics  
- People forget the meeting is on and do not attend  
- People turn up late with no notice  
- Meetings go well overtime
