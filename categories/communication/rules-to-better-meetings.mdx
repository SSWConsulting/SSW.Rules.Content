Meetings that lack efficiency frequently occur because:

* People are not prepared  
* There is a lot of discussion but no resulting "action items"  
* Rat holes - Time is wasted digressing to unrelated topics  
* People forget the meeting is on and do not attend  
* People turn up late with no notice  
* Meetings go well overtime  

If you have a 1-hour meeting with 5 people in attendance, you're not just wasting 1 hour if it's not productive, your wasting 5 man hours. One hour for each attendee. That's a lot of man hours!

With this in mind, here are some rules on how to facilitate a great meeting and how to make sure they are productive and achieve an outcome.
