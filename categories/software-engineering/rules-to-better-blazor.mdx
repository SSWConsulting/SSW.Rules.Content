Blazor lets you build interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript. Blazor apps are composed of reusable web UI components implemented using C#, HTML, and CSS. Both client and server code is written in C#, allowing you to share code and libraries.  

[Get started with Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor)
