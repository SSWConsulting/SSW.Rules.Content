To enhance your Hyper-V clustering setup, ensure you disable NetBIOS on dedicated adapters, give your network adapters meaningful names, and segregate iSCSI and cluster networks on their own VLANs or switches. Additionally, specify a network for Live Migration and utilize a Microsoft-supported network setup for optimal performance.
