For a successful migration from SharePoint 2016 to Online, it's essential to develop a detailed migration plan and prepare adequately before the migration. Check the audit log for modifications, utilize tools like Sharegate to avoid errors, and know the steps to take after migration to ensure everything runs smoothly.
