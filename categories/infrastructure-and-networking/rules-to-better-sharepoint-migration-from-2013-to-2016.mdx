To ensure a successful SharePoint migration from 2013 to 2016, establish a comprehensive migration plan that includes identifying customizations, deploying imported solutions, and running a "Test-SPContentDatabase" check. Lock the SharePoint Content Database before backing up, migrate your service application databases, and verify for errors post-migration to maintain a smooth transition.
