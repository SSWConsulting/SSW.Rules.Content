Migrating from SharePoint 2007 to SharePoint 2010 can be a daunting task, but if you follow this guide you will be able to migrate with minimum problems.

 

These rules focus on migrating from a single server configuration of SharePoint 2007 to a single server configuration of SharePoint 2010. We will assume your SharePoint 2007 server has the DNS of sharepoint.northwind.com
