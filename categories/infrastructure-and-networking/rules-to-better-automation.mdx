Automation uses technology to carry out tasks and processes with minimal or no human intervention. It involves machines, software, and other systems to perform tasks that were previously done manually, resulting in increased efficiency, accuracy, and productivity. Automation has been adopted in various industries, including manufacturing and logistics, healthcare, and finance, transforming the way we live and work. In recent years, home/office automation has gained popularity, allowing homeowners to automate various aspects of their homes, such as lighting, climate control, security systems, and entertainment systems. As the adoption of automation technology continues to grow, it's expected to have a significant impact on the way we live and work in the future.
