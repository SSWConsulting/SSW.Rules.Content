Since 1990, SSW has supported the developer community by publishing all our best practices and rules for everyone to see.

If you still need help, visit [SharePoint Server Consulting](http&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/SharePoint.aspx) and book in a consultant.

When correctly configured, a SharePoint VM environment can save you a lot of trouble later on. So important that we think all SharePoint customization and development must be done on a Virtual Machine.

Do you agree with them all? Are we missing some? Let us know what you think.
