SQL Server Reporting Services is a comprehensive, server-based reporting solution that can author, manage, and deliver both paper-oriented and interactive, Web-based reports. Do you agree with all these rules? Are we missing some? [Let us know](https://www.ssw.com.au/company/contact-us) what you think.

🔊 Historical (2006) [Listen to Adam's podcast on these rules with Greg Low](https://sqldownunder.blob.core.windows.net/podcasts/SDU14FullShow.mp3) (42 min)
