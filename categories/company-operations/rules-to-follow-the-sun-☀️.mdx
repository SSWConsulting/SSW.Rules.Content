Following the Sun means handing work from one team to another as time zones change, allowing projects to keep moving even when part of the team is offline.

At SSW, we use this approach to accelerate delivery while maintaining the same level of quality, clarity, and accountability, regardless of where the work is done.

Following the Sun is not about working longer hours or rushing work. It relies on disciplined Scrum practices, clear ownership, and intentional handovers so that each team can confidently pick up where the last one left off.

These rules define how we Follow the Sun at SSW, ensuring work stays visible, context is never lost, and teams across Australia, Europe, China, and North America operate as one.
