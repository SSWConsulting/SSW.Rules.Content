Specification Reviews are the 1st step to properly engaging with a client and need to be done well.  
The following are rules that will make sure you know how and how much, to spec-out upfront.

A lot of teams don’t spend much time reviewing what the software is intended to do, before starting implementation. 
Some agile(ish) environments seem to think the (often simplistic) user story is everything and taking the time to really spec things out, is deemed “too waterfall”. There’s a balance, obviously, but getting multiple perspectives from different stakeholders (both business and technical) during reviews, is essential to get the intended function and behaviour right. 

Having senior testers involved in this step can be valuable as they bring different skills and perspectives to the review, especially as they’re generally one of the few people in the team with a focus on what might go wrong (via a critical thinking mindset), rather than focusing on success (typical of the builder’s mindset).

Any review still leaves stuff on the table. There will always be the unknown ‘unknowns’ that only reveal themselves as you actually get into the work. This makes knowledge work like software development (and testing as part of it) difficult to estimate accurately. Risk is what’s left over when you think you’ve thought of everything. It is important to acknowledge that we will always learn new things as we proceed through development and testing – no matter how thorough we try to be up front. 

Tools like journey maps are a useful input into both development and testing, providing fertile ground for coming up with test ideas and identifying areas of risk to influence test coverage.
