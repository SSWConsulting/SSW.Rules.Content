<p>SSW&#39;s Rules to Better <a href="http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Scrum.aspx">Scrum​</a>​&#160;allows businesses to address their most important challenges first and respond quickly to change. Our rules advocate software consultants working on-site, or on the phone, so long as there is close consultation with business users, with the goal to become integrated members of the client&#39;s team.​​<br/></p>

      <p>Software must help a business become more efficient and build better relationships with their clients. Business need software to be produced cost-effectively and quickly. Simple steps upfront stop software being slow to build and difficult to change. </p>
