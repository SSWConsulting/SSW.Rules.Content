Angular is everywhere.

There are two distinctive versions of Angular because the second version was a major rewrite. AngularJS denotes the legacy version while **Angular** (or Angular 2+) represents any version of Angular after 2.0. This page is a set of rules and guidelines to get you up and running using Angular with the least pain possible.

Angular and React have been the 2 dominant front-end technologies for the last few years. We have been running our Angular Superpowers course that entire time, and I’m still amazed that every time we run the course, we sell out. 

Of course, we update the course with every version, but it's still amazing because JavaScript frameworks have a reputation for being transitory. But these 2 frameworks have become entrenched in enterprises everywhere.



A lot of these rules have originated from the [Angular Superpowers Tour](https&#58;//www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Events/Training/Angular-Superpowers-Tour.aspx).
