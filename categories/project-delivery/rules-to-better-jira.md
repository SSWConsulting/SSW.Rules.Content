Rules Need Revision!

The Jira rules were somewhat outdated by the upgrade to Jira 4 that changed the dashboard functionality significantly.  They have not been updated yet and we await a decision on how much effort it is worth expending before any changes commence. 

I had to make this note a new rule as I could not see a way of adding a note to the site without changing the title.
