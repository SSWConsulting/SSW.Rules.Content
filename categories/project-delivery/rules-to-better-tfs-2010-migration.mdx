**Update: TFS 2010 has been replaced by TFS 2012 - if you're moving to TFS 2012, see our [Rules to Better TFS 2012 Migration](/rules-to-better-tfs-2012-migration).**

In this page we will look at upgrading an existing TFS2008 server to TFS2010. We assume you are using a single server configuration and have a DNS entry setup for external access at tfs.yourdomain.com.

Upgrading Team Foundation Server can be a daunting task. Be assured that things have become easier and if you follow this guide, it will minimize your downtime.

If you still need help, visit [Application Lifecycle Management](https://www.ssw.com.au/consulting/alm-tooling) and book in a consultant.
