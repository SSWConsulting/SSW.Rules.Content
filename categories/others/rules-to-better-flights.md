### Do you know how to manage Qantas bookings?

SSW encourage our staff to book their flight on Qantas because of its safety, reliability, environmental sustainability and reputation.

Qantas offers a robust loyalty program, which can provide benefits to both the individual traveler and the company. Companies can accumulate points and rewards through the program that can be used to offset future travel expenses.

* All flights booked by the company can be managed through Qantas Business Reward https://www.qantas.com/au/en/business-rewards/qbr/myaccount
* There is a monthly report which can be downloaded via https://www.qantas.com/au/en/business-rewards/qbr/reports
