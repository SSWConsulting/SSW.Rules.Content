Migrating from TFS 2013 Update 4 to TFS 2015.

Upgrading Team Foundation Server can be a daunting task. Be assured that things have become easier and if you follow this guide, it will minimize your downtime.

In this page we will look at performing an in-place upgrade from TFS 2013 Update 4 to TFS 2015. In this walkthrough, we assume you are currently using a single server configuration, but might want to separate your SQL Server from your TFS server. We also assume you have a DNS entry setup for external access at tfs.northwind.com.
