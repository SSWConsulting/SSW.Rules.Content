SSW's Rules to Better [Scrum](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Scrum.aspx) allows businesses to address their most important challenges first and respond quickly to change. Our rules advocate software consultants working on-site, or on the phone, so long as there is close consultation with business users, with the goal to become integrated members of the client's team.



> Software must help a business become more efficient and build better relationships with their clients. Business need software to be produced cost-effectively and quickly. Simple steps upfront stop software being slow to build and difficult to change.
> 
> Read our rules on Scrum (project management) for some simple tips before starting your next project.
