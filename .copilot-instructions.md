# SSW Rules Content - Copilot Instructions

This repository contains SSW's technical rules and best practices. When working with markdown files in this repository, you have access to several custom markdown extensions and features beyond standard markdown.

## Custom Markdown Extensions

### Custom Containers

The SSW Rules platform supports custom container syntax using triple colons (:::). These create styled boxes for different types of content:

#### Good/Bad Examples
```markdown
::: bad
Figure: Bad example - This shows what not to do
:::

::: good
Figure: Good example - This shows the recommended approach
:::

::: ok
Figure: OK example - This is acceptable but not ideal
:::
```

#### Information Boxes
```markdown
::: greybox
This is a box using the class "greybox" - typically used for code examples or quotes.
:::

::: info
This is an information box using the class "info". Use for additional context or tips.
:::

::: highlight
This is a box using the class "highlight" - use to draw attention to important content.
:::
```

#### Special Purpose Boxes
```markdown
::: china
This is a box using the class "china" - used for China-specific content or variations.
:::

::: codeauditor
This is a box using the class "codeauditor" - used for SSW Code Auditor related content.
:::

::: todo
This is a box using the class "todo" - used for content that needs to be completed or updated.
:::
```

### Figure Captions

When using images or code examples, always include descriptive figure captions:

```markdown
![Figure: Description of what the image shows](image-filename.jpg)

::: good
Figure: Good example - Clear description of why this is the recommended approach
:::
```

### Code Blocks

Use language-specific syntax highlighting:

```csharp
// C# code example
public class Example
{
    public void Method() { }
}
```

```powershell
# PowerShell example
Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.Name -eq "chrome" }
```

```json
{
  "example": "JSON configuration"
}
```

### Rule Structure

Every rule should follow this structure:

1. **Frontmatter** - YAML metadata at the top
2. **Introduction** - Brief explanation before `<!--endintro-->`
3. **Detailed content** - Examples, explanations, and best practices
4. **Related rules** - Links to other relevant rules (optional)

### Best Practices for SSW Rules

1. **Use good/bad examples** - Always show what not to do vs. what to do
2. **Include figure captions** - Every image and code block should have a descriptive caption
3. **Be specific** - Use concrete examples rather than abstract concepts
4. **Reference other rules** - Link to related rules to create a knowledge web
5. **Keep it practical** - Focus on actionable advice developers can implement

### Links and References

- Internal rule links: `[Rule title](/rule-uri)`
- External links: `[Link text](https://example.com)`
- Always use descriptive link text, never "click here" or "read more"

### Video Embeds

For YouTube videos, use the custom syntax:
```markdown
`youtube: https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID`
```

## Content Guidelines

- Write in present tense
- Use active voice
- Be concise but comprehensive
- Include practical examples
- Validate all code examples work
- Use consistent terminology across rules
- Follow the SSW tone of voice (professional but approachable)

## File Organization

- Rules go in `/rules/rule-name/rule.md`
- Categories go in `/categories/category-name.md`
- Images go in `/assets/` or next to the rule file
- Use kebab-case for file and folder names
